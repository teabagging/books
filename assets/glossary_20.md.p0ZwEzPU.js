While this book is a history of Google, it also gives a thought provoking discussion of how our brains work. The whole concept of \\"search\\" is presented so that anyone can understand how search engines (including our brains) operate and how this knowledge informs those who are writing these engines. It's a bit scary to realize that computer programs are tailoring every interaction we have with a computer in the hope that our experience will be what the programmer thinks is our desire. From the articles which appear on the home pages of places like MSN to the suggestions for other purchases on Amazon, someone is second guessing our every move. What ever happened to serendipity? All in all a fascinating read."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"A very well-researched and well-written book. Most notable is author John Battelle's getting the essence of just how bad search was until the Google Guys came along and nailed the concept. Battelle recounts how major players in the IT industry assumed search was as good as it was going to get circa 1997 - 2000 (and it really s-cked in retrospect), so they went off trying to become traffic and portal sites. [Larry Page archly notes that Yahoo and Excite had 'really good horoscopes' on their home pages. Touch&eacute;.]Meanwhile, Battelle recounts how Page and Brin set out with their 'Backrub' project at Stanford to solve search and transform it into what it is today. While Google is taken as a given today, Battelle takes us all back to that moment when we all first used Google and had that \\"Oh. My. God.\\" moment.The insider-ish stuff about Page and Brin is fascinating. I could read 500 pages of that stuff alone. It's a thrilling ride from cramped offices at Stanford to the Googleplex. 400,000 percent (!) revenue growth over five years is difficult to fathom, but Battelle gets as close to anyone to the essence of how that happened.It's nice to see the chapter here about Bill Gross of Idealab. The original incarnation of Google AdWords was a blatant copy of Idealab's Goto.com (later named Overture) incubation."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"This book covers not only the stellar rise of Google, but the entire Web Search industry. Both the business and technical side of this field are covered very clearly and the author makes a convincing argument for its importance to both commercial and private consumers. The most interesting parts of the book are the imaginative projections of how search could change our daily lives."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"I am usually skeptical about purchasing books which I can't skim through and get the basic story behind it but I must say this book really lived upto its reputation. John Battelle captures the essence Search and the key players within the industry, paste, present and future trends of Search."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"The Search by John Battelle provides an interesting history of Internet search technology with a heavy emphasis on Google. It also highlights how search engines and the Internet have rapidly changed and offers insight into where search technology may be heading next. Although there is a heavy emphasis Google, the book ultimately aims at the bigger picture: the past, present, and future of search, in both the business and technology aspects.John Battelle does a great job at giving a detailed overview of the role of Search, which is especially helpful for a person like me, who has a very limited knowledge of this topic. In addition, having a strong business and technical background, Battelle is even able to get a lot of insider information to further support his ideas. For example, he is able to incorporate his interviews with people like Brin and Page at Google, Bezos at Amazon, Yang and Filo at Yahoo, etc. Not to mention, he even brings the lesser known to the spotlight: Bill Gross, founder of GoTo.com, the first company to successfully provide an Internet search engine which relied upon sponsored search results and pay-per-click advertisements. It is these parts of the book that are most interesting, and enlightening. Not to mention, the book is a lot more credible with so many key figures of the Search industry being incorporated into the book.Before reading this I thought that Search was just a box to enter in terms to search for. However, it is a rapidly growing field that morphs with many business ramifications: advertising, media, and sales to name a few. As we all know, Google makes the majority of their money off advertisements. In addition, many Internet users use the search engine to do their shopping as they are able to do some research on the item and find the best price before making their final purchase. Or, many also just do it because it allows for them to conveniently shop in the comforts of their own homes. The search engine's capabilities are endless. Many really novel ideas are and will continue to be coming out of the search engine/internet media industry. Already, we are thinking beyond text search queries and looking into visual queries. However, at the same time, agreeing with Battelle, we are definitely not far from search becoming like the voice of the Star Trek computer that even understands our verbal queries."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"Well written, with insight gained from years of interviews, Search was an easy, entertaining read. Not only did it breakdown some of the timeline about Google's success, it gave insight into the inner workings of the Google and it's founders, as well as a view into the entire field of search. The book inspired a quest for a deeper knowledge of the web itself."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"John Battelle subtitles his book, The Search, \\"How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture.\\" This statement is quite ambitious and the book does not quite live up to it. It does, however, give a good overview of the role of Search, its effect on business and life, and how various companies, especially Google, were involved. The topic is of great importance to all of us, whether or not we avidly search the Internet. Thus it is an important book and for that reason I give it a high evaluation. The strong point of the book is that Battelle is both knowledgeable and well connected on this subject, thus he is able to get access to the key players involved with Search--Brin and Page at Google, Bezos at Amazon, Yang and Filo at Yahoo, etc. Battelle also tells some interesting stories about lesser known figures such as Bill Gross. It is these parts of the book that are most interesting and enlightening.But the book also suffers from a number of flaws, some repairable, some not.First of all, as Battelle notes, that doing a book on Search can be boring and the sections of the volume that are strictly about this topic are indeed not very interesting, especially for those of us who are not technically versed on computer and Internet language. One shortcoming of the book is that it could have benefited from a glossary. Battelle assumes that he readers are literate enough to understand what he means by such terms as \\"petabyte\\" and \\"exabyte\\" and uses language that is beyond the understanding of ordinary people. For example, on page 171 he quotes extensively from comments made by Tim Armstrong, VP of advertising at Google, regarding the future state of advertising that are large unintelligible to a non-technical person. His use of words such as \\"scale\\" also assumes that the reader understands the meaning of this word in technological jargon. Finally, there is the following example from page 268: \\"The gate opens and you drive one-quarter mile to a four-story slate gray building, which looks rather like a Nakamichi preamp, only with windows...\\" Well, of course, now I know what the building looks like!!A problem that is not correctable is that the book is dated. Battelle completed it in early 2003 which makes it ancient history in the fast paced world of the Internet. Thus it is more of a history of Search rather than a description of its present condition. He does give some of his insights in the future potential of search and this parts are interesting and thought-provoking. Battlelle also spends too much time on Google. Admittedly this company is in the forefront of Internet Search, but it has been written about in detail. For example, The Google Story, by David Vise covers much of the same ground and, in my view, does a better job. Certainly it was necessary to cover the Alpha Dog in this field, but more about what others have done might have made the book more interesting.In sum, The Search is well worth reading, but non-techies will have some trouble and techies may find it date"},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"I loved this book and how it approached talking about search instead of just Google. It covers other big players in the field, goes over the entire industry, in addition to giving solid and good information about Google itself.Also loved the author's style and his ability to keep things relatively succinct."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"I love the tech industry and this book didn't disappoint. It is very well written and it keeps you interested the entire way through. It also does a very good job of following the Google story from beginning up to almost-current-day. I couldn't beat the price that I got this for on Amazon."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"As a computer professional I thought I pretty much got Search chalked out. It was quite a revelation to see that this book reveals facets about search that I did not comprehend before.Very exciting book and incidentally very good information about Google as a company as well.You can see my blog entry below as well if interested in my review: http://rajascyberspot.blogspot.com/2008/08/google-and-story-of-search.html"},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"It's a great overiview of the search industry and its brief but intense history.However, it's also a good and refreshing reminder that success stories, such as Google's, are not envisioned or planned they way they later unfold. For example, the book explains how Google early on tried to sell their search engine to Yahoo! or one of the other portals, but no buyer was found! Google was in financial hardships and did not know how to make money (except with traditional banner ads) when Bill Gross came up with the pay-per-click model that Google simply copied."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"This book provides a great review and account of the history on how the foundation of 'search' became what it is.From original information retrieval technology, to modern day search the reader is taken on a journey from dorm-room technology to startup company with all the situations and decisions that search pioneers faced, in the early days of search to what is now the status quo.As someone who has grown up with search, this is a great read of how search evolved and provides a great backbone for understanding the relationships of the various companies involved. This is a must read for those in the SEO/SEM industry."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"I found \\"The Search\\" captivating. Partly this could because of my long time fascination with the Internet and part of it because of my marketing mind. It tells of the cat and mouse game of spammers and how Google tries to outwit them (sometimes hurting innocent marketers at the same time).I loved the section on the future of search. Ideally we want a search that gives us what we are thinking about - not just what we say we want. This is about filtering, presentation and understanding.It has a whole section on Semantic Web which is another area I am fascinated with.Highly recommend the book if you like thinking about the future and if you like marketing."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"I have always wondered how Google made so much money from Advertising alone. This book helped me answer that question. BTW, I have recently changed the job from being a moribund corporate IT developer to being an engineer at Google. Reading this book was my first attempt at understanding my employer."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"\\"The Search\\" by John Battelle is a casual and mostly entertaining walk through the last 10 or so years of digital search, mostly but not entirely centered around the phenomenon of Google.Search technology as contrived today is the act of continually applying better and better algorithms as new patterns are unearthed in the large body of data that is the Web. The first result is a several-billion-dollar advertising business that flattened print and brand advertising.As the algorithms are still young, there is still room for Search to grow. It is even, notes Battelle, reshaping our \\"cultural grammar.\\" Disembodied terms. We search to find information, to locate things to buy, to find a shorter route to what we knows exist, but also, he chides in an aside, to secure our immortality. We search for what we know exists, and we search to discover what we have a feeling may exist.Battelle mentions Melvil Dewey, of the dreary Dewey Decimal System. But he assigns mathematician Gerald Salton - inventor of Salton's Magical Automatic Retriever of Text [SMART] in the late 1960s -- as the father of the digital search.\\"Salton introduced many of the seminal concepts commonly used in search today, including concept identification based on statistical weighting, and relevance algorithms based on feedback from queries,\\" he writes, noting how Salton's work spurred an annual searchers' get-together [between 1980 and the mid-1990s] knows as the Text Retrieval Conference.Battelle rightly lingers on Alta Vista, for many the first home page they set. Beginning life as a demonstration of DEC's Alpha chip and server meant that it held from the start the seed of its downfall. IBM, DEC, Microsoft .. no established tech company, no matter how grand its heuristics hardware or queries .. was likely to successfully start a whole new search-oriented business outside its mainstream business. That Google, with a somewhat defiant non-commercial stance (at the time), emerged as the big kahuna of text retrieval, is in large part ironic, and good fodder for story telling like Bagtetelle's.Conclusion - The story has brilliant pacing at the outset and then begins to suffer from the \`first take on history\\" syndrome. In the end it's a collection of magazine stories, or web postings - journalism between hard covers, really. The book would be too offputting, no doubt, if he really devoted a lot of time to \`splaining' what goes on in that big-little box called Google. But you can't fault the author for pushing. The book came out in late 2005, just as Google - Google as Manna, or Google as Moloch, take your pick - reached an initial apogee."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"I enjoyed this book, and especially the frequent discussions about \\"the perfect search\\" and the future of search. I can imagine a time that the author's prediction comes true and I especially enjoy how encompassing search really is. Before reading this I thought that search was just that - a box to enter in terms to search for. But, it is a burdeoning field that morphs with many business ramifications - advertising, media, and sales to name a few . The idea that someday (soon) we will be able to search for television programming and the ads could be targeted specifically for our tastes is a remarkable advance. And as a consumer, we could turn off these ads for a fee or watch the ads and get free cable. Really novel ideas are coming out of the search engine/internet media industry. We are not far (1 generation) from search becoming like the voice of the Star Trek computer that understands our verbal queries."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"outstanding work on the google generation...if investing in this area, this book must be read...especially the parts of the book that describe the way \\"meeting\\" are held at Google"},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"You probably use search engines to find information. If you already understand how one search engine varies from the next, this book will be much too simple and limited for you. Avoid the book.If, however, you choose which search engine based on how cool the url is for that engine, you should read this book. It will tell you a lot that can help you find better information . . . and what you may be able to look for in future search engine improvements. If that's your main reason for reading the book, you'll find it too long and involved for that purpose. There's an awful lot about the history of Google . . . which is essentially ancient history by now. I graded the book down from this perspective mainly because it takes Mr. Battelle a long time to get the simplest ideas across."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"Loved the book--great sweep across the subject but it is full of spelling mistakes \\"Schimdt\\" is unforgivable & causal for casual?Really sloppy proof reading....."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"John Battelle has done a great job at \\"The Search\\" documenting just how relevant searching has become to our knowledge-heavy culture. John does an awesome job at documenting how searching grew in relevance as the Internet grew in size an importance, from the early attempts to find technical papers, to Altavista, to the directory-based approach that Yahoo championed for years to today's Google.The book is focused more on the high level cultural impacts of the search, such as the changes in the way we look for things, the way we find about people we will meet (e.g. a new business partner, a date) and about how companies and Governments are changing the way they market products and engage with their customers in today's world. This high level focus is great since it provides some sort of a giant chessboard and places search in it.Besides being a high level overview, The Search does a very good job at documenting the history of Search, the different approaches, the different decisions that were made (e.g. Google splitting \\"organic searches\\" from paid advertisements). This historical perspective is really helpful to understand some of the rules that govern searching today and why some of the old ways of doing things are not in vogue anymore.Besides the high level and historical strenghts of the book, Battelle does a good job at explaining some of search-realted phenomena: The Long Tail phenomena, Click Fraud and the pirates trying to cheat on search engines to their advantage, the relation between commerce and search and many others.Areas in which the books falls short: the book dedicates most of the space to descibe the historical and today's aspects of search that it does not dive as deep into the future. For example, the semantic Web, Tags, searching Audio and Video and other emerging phenomena are not covered as deeply in the book. It is also not as technical, so while you will find a high level explanation at how PageRank works, it does not dig deeply from a technical aspect on this.A very recommended read, mostly as a historical reference of search, but leaves us waiting for Battelle to do another book into the future of search."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"As its title indicates, this book is about searching the internet. Hence, as its subtitle suggests, it is to a large extent about Google. The decision to focus on search rather than on Google is one that John Battelle feels compelled to defend in his first chapter. The publisher quotes this defense inside the front flap of the bookjacket.It was a great decision, and results in an excellent book about a vital topic. Search is more important and interesting than any one firm. This book is more important an interesting than \\"Larry and Sergei's excellent adventure\\" would have been.So, early on, Batelle gives us detail on AltaVista, the brilliant and misunderstood orphan that was at one point the leading search engine. He closes the book with an account of what's next for search, which is a bigger question than what's next for Google. Having said that, the core of the book is the story of Google, and Battelle tells it well.The main problem with this book is... that it's a book. So, given that it was published in September 2005, it was \\"finished\\" months earlier. So, toward the end of the book, we encounter the phrase \\"once blogs reach critical mass,\\" and when we search the index at the back of the book for \\"podcast,\\" we don't find an entry.I hope that there is a paperback, with an extra chapter covering blogs, podcasts, and other success stories of 2005. Of course, by the time that came out, something else will have come along.Still, I highly recommed this book."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"With clarity we learn that Search is a tool of intent, i.e., a basic activity of the brain.

John has done an awesome job in interviewing and researching all the key people and issues around search engine industry and technology. John himself is not a technologist, as he is the first to admit, but he is a very talented researcher, writer, journalist, and an entrepreneur. He analyses with keen insight the rise of search engine business starting from Webcrawler in 1994 to Google in 2005. He also delves deep into the underlying algorithms and paid for performance click advertising business model that lead to multibillion dollar business today. I enjoyed reading this book so much and thought that it is so informative and educational for anyone in search engine industry that I bought 40 copies to give to every single employees at [...]. We are still in day one of search and search will be part of every day life for all Internet users. This is an excellent book for people who are not only in the industry but also interested in learning about the dynamics of Internet business and impact of search in our society.

This book paints an exciting picture of things to come and business history in the making."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"3/4 of this book is about the rise and the criticisms of Google.John Battelle barracked negative criticisms at Google throughout most of the chapters. Opposed to its advertised contents on the history of Search, John Battelle's book situates itself in a shocking polarized position. For good examples of authors who respect neutrality and who trust readers to establish their own opinions, I recommend you take a look at:China Shakes the World: A Titan's Rise and Troubled Future -- and the Challenge for America by James Kynge andThe Wal-Mart Effect: How the World's Most Powerful Company Really Works--and How It's Transforming the American Economy by Charles FishmanThe stellar books above (just check the awards they won) accomplished a high degree of professionalism that is so lacking in John Battelle's. Kynge and Fishman give insights to their subjects through sometimes difficultly gathered first-hand sources. Going beyond, they provide sufficient backgrounds on the rise of Chinese economy and WalMart, always remaining silent observers (they don't opinions) but at the same time, highlighting importantly facts and hinting at what might be the ways to look at the two's future. They allow you, the reader, to judge for yourself the pros and cons for the issues at hand. These books are the kind that makes you *think*. Oppositely, Battelle's The Search jumps from one fact after another about Google, each followed by criticisms, and then a positive anecdote about Google followed by more negative comments and followed by more criticisms... and as other readers have commented, the \\"facts\\" Battelle make arguments about in his book are web clips and not first-hand sources.Mingled in between those internet cut-and-paste, why is the book still filled with so many blunt factual errors? To list just a few:On pp49-50 : \\"...googol ... meant 1 followed by 100 zeros.\\" -- What???On pp76 : \\"...Google, after googol, the term for the number 1 followed by *100* [My highlight] zeros\\" -- so I didn't misread earlier.On pp76 : \\"...mathematical equivalent of e, a concept ... well known to serious math geeks...\\" - \\"serious math geeks\\"??? No New York high school students, and that was back in 2002, 3 years before the book's publication, could have taken the SAT's and entered colleges above SUNY Stony Brook without knowing the *irrational number* \\"e\\" to three digits.And why John Battelle put in so many instances of extreme languages? As substitutions for emoticons that illustrate his anger/incredulity??On pp 96 : \\"... every one of his investors f**k-you rich...\\"On pp 170 : \\"... $300 for a f**king stroller...\\"On pp 189 : \\"...Who the h**l does [Google] think it is?\\"Engineers, scientists and policy makers... don't waste your money and time on this one.One star for the flow of paragraphs and the organization.End of my rant."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"John Battelle, the cofounder of Wired Magazine, has produced an excellent elaboration of the concept of search. Battelle focuses largely on online search, describing the history and early development of search before moving on to several chapters on the preeminent search engine today, Google.Google, begun by two Stanford PhD students, has always tried to be a different kind of company. The firm takes great pride in promoting its positive image, and \\"Don't be Evil\\" is a kind of unofficial slogan for the company. This image is of course not reality. Google has had to compromise its ethics when it entered the huge Chinese market, cooperating with Chinese authorities looking for pro-democracy dissidents. Its advertising business, the backbone of the company's revenue, has led to several lawsuits, the most damming of which involved the company American Blinds and Wallpaper Factory. Stories abound from disgruntled former (and Battelle quotes a few anonymous current) employees about the dictatorial management style of the company's founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page.However, Google has been able to weather criticism because its products work. And Google is not about to settle with dominating the Web search market. And the best part of this book is Battelle's discussion of its and its competitors' future plans. Creating the perfect search: when search engines will be able to guess your intentions and provide exactly what you want, and lots of other useful information, instantly and from anywhere, not just when you are at your computer, is where the future is leading."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"At the core of the book though is the concept of what a search engine can do.Obviously there are as many possibilities to develop and implement search algorithms as there are creative people to invent them (Microsoft MSN, Yahoo and others have products that compete directly with, and in many cases outperform the more well known brand the book focuses on), but essentially they have the power to pull together unbelievable amounts of formerly disconnected data, and create a targeted marketing aimed at you personally.We are only in 2006!"},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"Thank you John Battelle for writing this book! An excellent read that is not only inciteful and revealing enough for the die hard techie but also interesting and understandable enough for the barely computer literate. It is obvious that knowledge and detail that Battelle brings to this work could only have been gleaned by an insider. He lays out the story of Search and Google in such a clarity of detail and thoughtfullness that it draws in even those who would otherwise have no real interest in computers or the internet. A truly wonderful first work."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"This is the first full book I've read in some time; I'm more of amagazine article, short story, forum / blog type guy. Anyway, I was fully engaged in this history and examination of Search. I'm happy it didn't just focus on Google and told about a wider spectrum of companies.This book was especially relevant to me since I run most aspects of a commerce website. Important topics such as Search Engine Optimization and Pay Per Click advertising are touched on in such way that a deeper understanding is developed.If you work in the e-commerce field or want to know a bit more about what really happens when you're looking for info on the web, get this book as a great jumping off point. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"When you read the title, you might make the false presumption that this is a book about Google; it really isn't. The author puts forth a concept of a database of intentions early on. In his words:\\"The Database of Intentions is simply this: the aggregate results of every search ever entered, every result list ever tendered, and every path taken as a result...Taken together this information represents a real-time history of post-Web cultuare - a massive clickstream database of desires, needs, wants, and preferences that can be discovered, subpeonaed, archived, tracked and exploited for all sorts of ends.\\" (p.6)It is the importance of this idea that drives Battelle and the book. He points out early on, that this is a book about search using the Google and other significant stories, to illustrate his point - that Search is bigger than all of us. This may be a potentially cold topic, but Battelle takes the reader on a fascinating journey through time. Really it presents a history of search, with reminders of where Google is in the process/picture.Battelle gives us the technical side (watered down) of searches, the growth of the search economy, big names such as Monier, AltaVista, Compaq, Lycos, Yahoo, Excite until we get to the birth of Google - an interesting and informative chapter.He then takes a detour on the history of GoTo.com arguing that it is this, Bill Gross' business model that \\"saw in search seeds of an economic revolution.\\" (p.93) Battelle then spends time tracing the business model and, essentially, Bill Gross' career from early GNP to IdeaLab and to GoTo.com. Essentially, Gross saw something in the undifferentiated traffic - the fact that intentional traffic was/could be valuable. Enter advertisers paying when their ads are clicked upon. The story of GoTo continues and leads to Google and (messy) dealings. The search regains power. Portals regain status.The Chapter on Google is informative, fascinating, and a worthwhile read. Battelle's writing skills come to the fore in this one as he keeps us as up-to-date as a book can be. The sense of the giant of Google is reinforced but none of the panic. The following chapter on the Search economy is really a prediction and validation of Battelle's own beliefs - that Search is essential to the economy and the one binding thing across all sites.The last few chapters jump back and forth between Google and the importance of Search addressing issues such as privacy and the government. The book ends with the Perfect Search and reminds us once again what searching is all about and its importance. These chapters are a good read.One interesting idea that came from reading this book is that the next decade is going to be known not for the expansion of technology, but the ability to make the information already at the beck and call of this technology into ordered, tidy packages for consumption. Think of the Internet like the US economy, once driven by industry, the margin for innovation is now static compared to the service sector.Battelle's book is an odd read at first; his outlined intentions jar a little with the jumpiness of the early chapters.. Asserting early that he didn't want to write a book about Google (and the Google people didn't want that either!), or just another business book, I think he achieves that. However, it is in his writing about people and situations that the book comes alive.Should you read this? Yes. It's an important book giving breadth and depth to an area we may not really think that much about. Will search engines really drive the change in web culture?"},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"John Battelle's history of the search has an aloof style that can put off many of the readers. However as a message for the readers, instead of focusing on the books many \\"look how smart I am\\" moments, really take a look at some of the ideas of how things could change as information becomes findable.This is not a book that I would recommend to nuts and bolts geek involved in the computer industry. This is a book that I would recommend to someone who wants to take a non-computer industry and incorporate new ideas for knowledge management and knowledge as part of a product. I look at the place where I used to work and this book would help in two ways: Knowledge Management and consumer data driven product design. We can now provide consumers with data for them to use products more effectively and be able to communicate with them in new ways.I would use this book as a springboard for innovation to help generate new ideas. But beyond that, don't look for some brilliant insight to an age old problem."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"I tend to read most of the \\"how we did it\\" business books and pick out nuggets of experience that I can use in my never-ending habit of starting companies. The Search is excellent and entrepreneurs will find plenty to think about, even if you are not in the technology business or could care less about search.The founders of Google approached the problem of search as academics, not as experienced search hands. Their new view of the industry gave them the competitive advantage in what was considered a mature industry. Now the whole industry is in play again. This isn't just a technology concept, it works in ALL existing and new industries. Also read \\"The Medici Effect\\".As an aside, I met the author's wife at a comming-out party for the book in Silicon Valley. His praise of her in the Acknowledgements section is justified. A good entrepreneur's spouse is critical in the domain of start-ups and tough projects like books.- jim"},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"For the first few pages, I thought I was reading a spin-off of Malcolm Gladwell's trash pseudo-science. Then John Battelle settled down and turned in a fine overview of what search is all about, where it came from, where it's at, where it might go and, simultaneously, tells the rather amazing story of the rise of Google.Battele has done his homework. Better yet, he explains the science and technology of search, which is quite complex, in a way that practically any reasonably astute person can grasp.One can only assume that his take on the histories of Overture, Yahoo, Google and others are accurate. The bibliography is rather on the sparse side, although it is entertaining in and of itself. Battelle claims to have conducted numerous interviews and there is no reason to doubt this. Nothing Battelle says rings hollow (except for a couple of instances which I will describe below).Battelle does a truly extraordinary job of describing the implications of search technology in the future. For those outside the industry, I am sure they will be amazed, if not frightened, by just how pervasive search is and will become. In some ways, I almost wish Battelle had spent more time and pages on explaining what search can and probably will become. Policymakers should be ahead of the curve on this issue, lest they fall victim as usual to the special interests and the fear-mongers.Regretably, Battelle does get a couple of things wrong and it appears that he's been drinking the fear peddlers Kool-Aid. For example he takes Google to task for a part of its Terms of Service that he says, essentially, will do what it is legally required to do with user information. Battelle spins this as if it were some great sin to say this, much less do it.It doesn't seem to occur to Battelle that this provision is standard and that this condition is not at all uncommon. The law provides for the discovery of most \\"personal\\" information through subpoena or search warrant, depending on whether the case is civil or criminal. The reach of the law is still being debated in the proper forums, courts and legislatures. As it happens, providers like Google, Yahoo, AOL and Microsoft have already done a bang-up job of influencing legislation protecting them and their users, much to the detriment of some users. For example, a few years back a man was subjected to hideous abuse by the ignorant because some ignoramus had falsely claimed he cheered a national tragedy. There was no question of the man's innocence or of the falsity of the charges levelled against him. But thanks to the undoubtedly expensive lobbying of the information providers, they were immune from liability under the law. Also, not every request for information by subpoena has to be honored. Companies like Yahoo and AOL have successfully fought disclosure of user information in some instances. (At the time of this writing, Google is doing precisely that.)On the whole, Battelle is either acting out of his own personal political beliefs or repeating someone else's. The point is that he is wrong in his interpretation and wrong in claiming that Google is violating it's own \\"do no evil\\" hype. Likewise, his screed against the PATRIOT Act is entirely out of place in this book.Battelle does take Google to task for its behavior with regard to China. This alone should make it clear that Google's \\"do no evil\\" mantra is nothing more than marketing hype. Here Battelle concedes the obvious: any major company has to do business with China. And one does business with China on China's terms. (I am always amazed at how silent so many otherwise noisy politically oriented people become when it comes to China.)In any event, Battelle has lived up to the tagline on the cover: \\"[h]ow Google rewrote the rules of business and transformed our culture.\\" As a bonus, he's also done a credible job of describing what search is all about.Jerry"},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"Battelle begins by identifying the information available through \\"Zeitgeist\\" - summaries of what our culture is looking for or finds interesting, and what was once popular that is losing momentum. Such a database could tell clients what people are buying, looking to buy, or avoiding. It also could be used as a surveillance tool, as could GMail, Hotmail, etc.), especially under the Patriot Act.Tidbit: Experts see the future of search as more about understanding what is actually desired, rather than simply finding the results.Search engines start with the efforts of a \\"crawler.\\" Early versions of crawlers discovered and indexed only the titles of Web pages - today's also review entire Web sites. The crawler sends its data back to a massive database called the index. Raw indexes list all the pages on a site, as well as pertinent information about those pages - words, links, words around and within a link. The next step is to invert the data-base - to make a list of words associated with URLs. Analysis of the index then looks at the links on a page and the popularity of the pages that link to another page to construct a ranking. Indexes are also then populated with tags - eg. indicating they were written in a certain language, or belong to certain groups such as porn, spam, or rarely updated sites.Search provides the most efficient and inexpensive way for businesses to find leads, and didn't even exist a decade ago. Google has over 225,000 unique advertiser relationships. The yellow pages are a $14 billion business that search engines are going after now - Battelle expects the yellow pages to be extinct in a relatively short time.Behavioral targeting tracks one's search and browsing history to display ads that are most relevant. (Akin to what Amazon does it generating its \\"recommendations\\" for regular site visitors.)Google's \\"secret sauce\\" was adding its weighting system. Originally, the intent was to retrieve academic papers, weighted by the number of citations referencing each paper. Google's initial development was hampered by difficulty obtaining enough computer resources (fortunately, the Web was much smaller then), and Web page owners upset because they thought the crawler was stealing their material.Google incorporated in 1998, and obtained $25 million in capital - based on the attractiveness of its superior weighting algorithm. However, it did not come up with a viable plan to make money until '01, as its founders had decided to forgo becoming a portal, or offering banner ads (saw them as irrelevant).This was resolved by borrowing an idea from another entrepreneur - he used Inktomi's search engine and lacked Google's advanced ranking system, but had introduced the concept of having advertisers pay/click - in effect, a performance guarantee. Also syndicated with others' web sites (split the revenues). In October, 2000, Google launched AdWords - with a credit card and five minutes one could quickly become part of Google's data retrieval. Google's contribution to \\"click-through\\" fees was to also incorporate this volume into their ad rankings - thereby increasing the value of the ads and Google's revenues.Early on Google decided not to advertise - very expensive - instead they plowed the money into product improvements and relied on P.R. and world-of-mouth to gain volume. Another source of savings was their early use of distributed computing and stripped-down Linux (vs. \\"big iron\\" and Windows) - costing less and achieving greater reliability. Google doesn't talk about the number of PCs, etc. employed - outsiders estimate it at 150,000 servers, and perhaps 80,000 PCs.News reports were added after 9/11 - though they lack any business logic other than to present a fully-rounded search result.Another new product was \\"AdSense\\" - participating Websites (usually small, with no means of monetizing their traffic) were scanned and contextually relevant ads placed next to the context. (Eg. A site about flowers would receive ads selling flowers.) \\"GMail\\" was still another - users were offered very large amounts of free storage space, and in return, ads based on the message's context were inserted, creating a privacy furor and threats of legislation in California.\\"Click Fraud:\\" AdSense publishers using robots or low-wage workers to click on all ads in their site to increase revenue. Vendors estimate that about 25-30% of clicks are fraudulent - a problem not just for Google, but all with similar business models.Google's founders determined that they would avoid the \\"hiring spiral\\" they had seen in other startups. This involves a cascade of hiring decisions in which the initial hirees were very strong, but then hired underlings somewhat less capable (and threatening) down to the bottom run. Their solution was to make hiring decisions through committees.Tidbit: Spam is an on-going problem with search engines. One trick involves hiding high-traffic words like \\"car\\" all over a site (eg. small white letters on a white background) - thus, getting the search engine looking for \\"cars\\" to instead retrieve eg. porn. Google periodically revises its algorithm to deal with spammers' latest gimmicks - thus, what may top the information retrieved for a search today may lie 50 pages down tomorrow. The \\"bad news\\" associated with this is the legitimate businesses utilizing purely honest means of boosting their search ratings may suddenly find themselves out in the cold.Google eventually went public - inevitable, given the amount of venture capital funds involved in its startup. Again, Google did it differently - without underwriters and their huge fees. Instead, the shares were auctioned off - $85 was the initial price. Company also used two classes of stock, allowing the founders to retain control, and refused to provide Wall Street with earnings guidance or to smooth earnings like many other firms. It's price now exceeds $400 (P/E/ ratio exceeding 84), and some expect it to reach $600 in 2006.A truly excellent and informative book!"},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"I had long been intrigued by the ability of search engines to quickly lay the world's knowledge at our fingertips and wanted to know how they worked. This book well explained the intricacies of search as well as the economics, ethics and future of the field.

John Battelle is an excellent writer. He clearly explains the elements of a search engine. He has some very important and intriguing ideas such as the database of intention and a search economy. His notion that he likes news sources that can make the most of deep linking also opens up new ways of thinking.However, he spends a lot of time on the business news part of the book, namely the Google IPO and things like that which were of only minor interest to me. I wanted more on the transformed culture and the new business rules and a more impressionistic history of Google. In that sense I think the book over promised."},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"If you already have a website, or hope to have one someday, and are serious about making money from it, this book is a must-read.Search, in all of its forms, has become the dominant engine of profit on the Internet. Since Google dominates search with what is estimated to be over 50% of the search market, that means understanding Google, its roots, power and ambitions. This book, a fascinating read, by author John Battelle, an insightful and well connected insider, privy to the secrets and ruminations of Silicon Valley icons, provides that foundation of understanding.Author Batelle presents the evolution of Google and it's thinking about search and rankings of websites. He reports a cautionary tale of how search engines change their algorithms and your web site can go from a profitable #1 slot to an overnight near death experience in 50th or 500th place. People who've suffered and survived these sudden disastrous shifts tell how they combated them and fought their way back to decent rankings and profitability.Understanding the thinking and long term intentions of Google Search is as critical to webmasters as getting along and finding a niche in Wal-Mart shelves is to various small retailers. These are the 600 lb gorillas and, like it or not, to succeed on the Net, one has to adapt to Google's rules.A clue as to Google's future intentions: \\"the company would like to provide a platform that mediates supply and demand for pretty much the entire world economy.\\" Eric Schmidt, chairman and CEO of Google tells the author:\\"The sum of Google's market..is the world's gross domestic product. We think of it as a marketplace.\\"I enjoyed and benefited from the insights in this book - and, since all of us in business, large and small, are included in this marketplace - I recommend, much like a life raft in a powerful sea of search, you buy the book and read it in order to fashion a strategy and harness the power to be carried along by Google's enormous tide.Gretchen Glasscock, San Antonio, Tx, President,[...]"},{"Title":"The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture","review":"The beginning of this book; the parts that talk about the Database of Intentions and the theory and development of search was absolutely fascinating.

But the middle of the book had too much information about the dynamics of how search grew as an industry, what search engine was doing what etc. How they got funding etc.... Even the stuff about them trying to figure out how to monetize their project was dull.If you are a student or fan of information theory then this is a good addition to your library.

The earlier chapters lay the history of search, focusing mainly on Google largely because Google is the latest innovation in search, but the author doesn't focus solely on Google. He takes sidetracks when a history of search warrants it. He admits and agrees that Google is the latest, biggest, WOW-est thing in search, but his most amazing ideas come in the last chapter with the future of search.Imagine a world where you can never lose your luggage because it has a GPS chip in it and you can Google it. Imagine a world where you can Google the location of your keys, your car in a multi-tiered parking garage. He even talks about the \\"Big Brother\\" fears and gives them more credibility than perhaps I think they warrant. You could Google the location of your dog, your child. In the future, he says everything you own will have a computer chip in it, if not a GPS locator. Teenager out with your car, Google his location.The author spends considerable time pondering what this all means from a privacy perspective and not just \\"Big Brother\\" read govt watching, but anyone watching and most importantly from his perspective, potential advertisers watching. This book made me think about what's coming up in the future and I have a feeling that the future he's talking about is during the next 10 years, not during the next 100.Other reviewers said you'll love this book if you're a technie. I'm sure that's true for some of the early chapters, but I think the last chapter could be carved out for a magazine article that would appeal to the masses.

By all accounts, Google was a laggard to the Internet party - well behind pioneers such as Lycos, Excite, AltaVista and Yahoo!. But Google offered a truly disruptive technological innovation that reshuffled and restacked the cards in its favor. Not only did Google survive the dot-com implosion of the early 2000s, it went on to change how we use the Internet and - frankly - the world as we know it. The book titled - The Search - by author John Battelle goes beyond the traditional \\"rags-to-riches\\" saga of the companies co-founders and offers a comprehensive look at the technology that makes Internet search possible as well as its inescapable impact on nearly every aspect of our lives. Soundview recommends this book because it is based on interviews of more than 350 people at Google, as well as those who compete with Google, to provide an interesting 360 degree perspective of this fascinating company.

He apparently worked as a stock broker most of his career.In a one-page intoduction, Hoskins laments the desert of White History amid a sea of multiculural propaganda for every other race under the sun, at a time when the term politically-correct (PC) had yet to be coined-- 1958. This was also before the civil rights movement. Commander George Lincoln Rockwell, U.S.N. (ret.) had a sign in front of his Arlington, Virginia home: \\"White man fight: Smash the Black revolution NOW!\\" It was another time and another place.Hoskins makes an articulate case for studying history from the perspective of one's own race without apology. He then goes on to give a thumbnail sketch of that history ending in a compelling case for Nordic, Anglo-Saxon preservation.Considering current Black history in Zimbabwe and South Africa and the current so called War on Terror chapter in Israeli-American foreign policy in the Middle East, and World Trade vis a vis China and the so called Pacific Rim, Our Nordic Race is both timely and revelant.Perhaps the most important book in this vein and our time is The Culture of Critique, by California State University professor, Kevin MacDonald, Ph.D."},{"Title":"Our Nordic race","review":"_Our Nordic Race_ by Richard Kelly Hoskins, first published in 1958, claims to be one of the few books remaining that details the history of the white race as a whole. It is written from a straightforward, ethno-centric standpoint and makes no apology about it. Its audience is white southerners. According to _Our Nordic Race_ the Nordics came from the North, the areas of Norway, Sweden, Denmark and northern Germany. From there they spread out and conquered and brought civilization to all corners of the globe. Ancient Greece, Rome, Egypt, the Sumerians, Babylonians, Hebrews, Phoenicians and Carthaginians were all originally Nordics, but these empires fell when the Nordic nobility began to be dependent on the importation and slave labor of colored races which led to racial mixing and cultural decline. The later empires of Portugal, Spain, Italy, Byzantium and Russia also fell victim to this predicament. Even the Oriental civilizations such as India, China, Japan, Korea and Southeast Asia may have originally been founded by Nordics. India set up a caste system to seperate the ruling nobility from the lower-caste serfs. In China there were legends of light haired, grey-eyed visitors who may have been a tribe of Nordics that had traveled eastward accross Asia. Japananese, Korean and Southeast Asian civilizations were heavily influenced by China, which itself may have had a Nordic cultural base. The strangest section is the mention of the Aztecs in Mexico and the Incas in South America, civilizations which sprang out of nowhere. The Indians maintained legends of bearded, light-skinned gods who originally ruled over them, but had long since disappeared. The Aztecs at first thought Spanish conquistador Cortez as one of these forgotten gods. _Our Nordic Race_ focuses on the danger posed by racial integration, which has either destroyed or stagnated all Nordic civilizations in the past. The analysis of Communism and Socialist theory pulls no punches and is straight to the point. Communism was the main vehicle (at least when this book was written) to destroy the Nordics and to empower the international conspirators, originally the Khazars who converted to the religion of the Pharisees in the seventh century. Hoskins shows the nonsense that the \\"one race, one class, one color\\" of Marxism is. The omni-potent, all-controlling Socialist state will become and end in itself, only benifiting the small oligarchy who hold the reins of power over the banks, the media and the institutions of society. _Our Nordic Race_ is an excellent, if paranoid, extreme, and outdated, look at the racial and economic problems the West faces, as well as the world view propounded by believers in the Aryan Myth as the origin of human civilization. If the eventual extinction of the white race is a future reality, as it appears to be in the next hundred or so years, it will more likely be through a declining birth rate and mass-third world immigration rather than the violent slaughter that Hoskins describes."},{"Title":"Our Nordic race","review":"I am not an authority on the subject but I found this book to be interesting, readable, and relevant. I am grateful that the author took the time to research and write it. It will always be on my bookshelf as a reference."},{"Title":"Our Nordic race","review":"This was a good, and short read. Hoskins touches on the subject of inter-racial mixing and cultural blending in this book, and he explains how inter-racial mixing was the downfall of various empires in history. He further goes on to talk about the great legacy of the Nordic race, and how our people of today lack any sense of respect for the heritage of our Nordic race.While a lot of what Hoskins stated in this book is true, stil, some of it is false, and can be misleading. From what I can gather of my historical studies on the Nordic race, they didn't begin in the Scandanavian countries, and proceed to other parts of the world. Rather, they came to the Scandanavian region through migrations from other parts of the world. Some might say this is a small digression on my part, but be that as it may.This book is also a bit out-dated. However, much of the basic subject matter is still present with us today. This is a good read for someone who is looking for a short, but informative study of the problems the Nordic race faces today. Some might find this book a bit racist, and others will not. However, it IS geared towards the Nordic race (as the title openly suggests), so keep that in mind when you read it."},{"Title":"Our Nordic race","review":"_Our Nordic Race_ is the history of the world told from the perspective of the White Nordic Race. Unfortunately, the book seems to have a crass biologistic/Darwinistic understanding of race and seems to advocate a system of eugenics and birth control (man viewed as merely a breeding mechanism) as well as rules against miscegenation - things which various popes for example have condemned. This is problematic for the simple reason that man's genetic nature is far too complicated to fit into these simplistic categories, as well as the biologistic notion of \\"hybrid vigor\\". A more interesting perspective on race for example is that of the Italian aristocrat Julius Evola who seemed to view \\"Aryan\\" as a spiritual principle and argued against the notion of race advocated by \\"breeders\\". Also the book fails to take into account such things as for example the contribution of the Arabian culture in preserving Aristotle for the Europeans throughout the \\"Dark Ages\\". The book does however offer a far more realistic picture of racial struggle and race war than any liberal (politically correct) historian is likely to admit to. The fact is that race remains a problem in the world, that racial differences and genetic malformities do exist in man and that the achievements of the White Race are being undermined by the forces of subversion. While the threat from Soviet Russia in the book has largely been superseded, Communist China continues to remain a powerful threat to the continued growth of the American nation. In this sense, a real conflict of cultures can be seen between the Western European individualistic culture and the Chinese collectivistic one. I give this book four stars not because I agree with much of its content, but because it offers a novelty item which may be more honest on the issue of race than many liberal historians care to admit."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology","review":"This book is valuable on both historical and theological grounds. It represents the standard line of thinking in 19th Century conservative American theology. While at times it may appear to be dry, one must keep in mind this is how theology was normally done. To the reviewer who objected that Dabney's God was little more than Aristotle's unmoved mover, I have to admit my confusion. Dabney clearly rejected the extreme claims of natural theology (while understanding its limited value--see page 93).Dabney is clearly qualified to represent American theology. He mastered Turretin. Indeed, he could write out an outline of Turretin's 3 volume Institutes from the original Latin. I will now list some pros and cons of this volume:Pros: Dabney is nothing if not clear. Every chapter, while at times difficult to read, is succint and pointed. He can state a lot of truth and meaning into the smallest sentence. This allows for skillful polemics if at times difficult reading.His chapters on the atonement and justification were probably the best. His arguments against the Socinians are more relevant now than ever before. His chapter on Union with Christ (612-617) is better than most modern treatises. He doesn't bore you down with irrelevant detail, but powerfully presents the doctrine in six pages.Unlike most modern theologies, Dabney gives keen attention to the Law of God as a normative ethic for the Christian life. Sadly, this is lacking from most modern-day Reformed treatments. Dabney's exposition of the Ten Commandments is an excellent field-map to sanctification. His treatment on the covenant of grace, while perhaps dated because of modern controversies, is nonetheless helpful.Cons:The book, it is true, is dry at times. I think Dabney knew this. But to be fair, the only really dry part was the Prolegomena (e.g., the opening sections on knowledge and method). Dabney himself warned against extreme focus on such matters.We must also realize that Dabney was a child of his times, like we are a child of ours. Before we criticize Dabney on slavery (we will come back to that in a moment), we must take the our own plank of abortion out of our eye. Who are we to call him racist when millions of babies die every year? And to his credit, he did criticise the South for *unbiblical* forms of slavery.As to doctrinal disagreements, I do not think Dabney fully dealt with Calvin's view on the Lord's Supper, although I am more sympathetic to Dabney now than I was before I read it. Still, the spectre of Nevin hangs over the chapter.Conclusion:I found the book slow at first, but steadily picked up steam so that some chapters ended in a crescendo. It is valuable in that Dabney understood what a Systematic Theology could and could not do. No systematics text can function as a \\"timeless theology,\\" for the theologian is called to precisely the opposite task: to apply God's truth to his own situation. This Dabney did to the fullest."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology","review":"5 stars for the content, 1 star for the Kindle version. I have long benefited from the hardback version of Dabney's Systematic Theology and highly recommend it, I can not recommend the Kindle version. The formatting is horrible, random different fonts sizes, HTML links in the text, no linked table of contents so the navigation is difficult, it is painful to use. Get the hardback version, it will enrich your understanding of the Christian religion but avoid the Kindle version."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology","review":"Although I have not read Dabney extensively, I found his treatment of the Sabbath, or Lord's Day, to be very persuasive and well done. I'm thankful to have the oppportunity to read such a excellent systematic theology."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology","review":"Upon perusal this does look to be a great resource for any who wish to delve more deeply into historic Christian theology. I have also read Dabney's \\"Christ Our Penal Substitute\\" and there are many valuable insights we may gain from it, especially when compared to John Murray's \\"Redemption Accomplished and Applied\\".However, has anybody else noticed that this seems to be an incomplete copy of the work? Mine stops at chapter 32, and I would really like to have some of the info from chapter 35 on the covenant of redemption.Thanks!"},{"Title":"Systematic Theology","review":"Taken in small, topical bits, Dabney has a refreshingly strong (and very quotable) style. I admire Dabney for the way he was never afraid to trumpet God's truth and majesty in every line he wrote and his writings undoubtedly make a worthy addition to a grand history of Calvinistic thought.But I find his Systematic Theology to be a little too condensed. It's written in a very academic style that's suitable for a seminary classroom - after all, the book is based on his lectures at Union Theological Seminary.So even though it's filled to the brim with useful arguments, proofs and refutations, I doubt that it would be enjoyed by the common believer, or even a thinking believer. If you're an avid collector of theological books, or an armchair theologian, there's no question that Dabney's Systematic would be useful to have in your library. However, if you could only buy one systematic theology, I wouldn't recommend this one."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology","review":"Dr. R. L. Dabney's Systematic Theology represents the height of western scholastic theology, the logical conclusion of the theology of Augustine, Anselm, and Aquinas. The arguments are remarkable, the logic is impeccable, and theology is hideous. Dabney was influenced by extreme reductionism and the essesental denial of any Mystical Attribute in our Pre-Eternal Creator. If one wants a complete, accurate, and unbiased Christian Theology uninfluenced by medieval Catholic theology, may I recommend An Exact Exposition of the Orthodox Faith written by St. John Damascene in the Eighth Century, which is available freely online."},{"Title":"The Best Of Rowan: Fifty Designer Patterns","review":"I set this book aside for several months, since at first I was disappointed. A number of the sweaters showcased are from very recent Rowan magazines, and I was hoping for sweaters from the older,out of print, magazines. Also many of them weren't appealing to me at all. But I picked up the book again and found a few that I now want to make. The book contains a good variety for a knitter who does not already own Rowan magazine issues, and as is typical with Rowan, the sweaters are not simple to create. Rowan yarns are not a must to knit these either -- I am using a Cascade 220 for the first design in the book, a cabled pullover sweater, and I am altering the design to make it more &quot;American&quot;. The photographs are nice, although again they are repeats from the Rowan Magazines. I have looked at out of print issues of Rowan magazines, however, and there were other sweaters that I would have considered &quot;best of&quot; and am sorry not to see included here. At least half of the sweaters in this book I would never consider making, but I believe the book is worth owning for those few that are really beautiful and that I don't already own. The best thing Rowan can do for knitters, though, is to bring back into print all the vintage Rowan magazines so those of us who just discovered Rowan in the last few years can now have all those wonderful older designs without paying phenomenal prices for used issues of the out-of-print magazines (some sell for $700!)."},{"Title":"The Best Of Rowan: Fifty Designer Patterns","review":"This book was a true inspiration to me as a beginner. I am inspired to better my skills to do justice to some of the more complex patterns. My only problem with this book was the lack of directions for larger sizes. Most of the patterns gave directions only for sizes up to medium. Unfortunately I am not good enough yet to adapt patterns for smaller sizes to fit my L/XL body."},{"Title":"The Best Of Rowan: Fifty Designer Patterns","review":"This is a lovely book unless, like me, you have many of the recent magazines. Rowan has rekindled my interest in knitting, and this book will have the same effect on you. Remember however, if you have several of the more recent Rowan magazines, there is nothing new here for you."},{"Title":"The Best Of Rowan: Fifty Designer Patterns","review":"THIS BOOK IS PACKED FULL WITH 50 BEAUTIFUL COLOURFUL SWEATERS. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK FOR A BEGINNER, AS MOST OF THE PATTERNS ARE QUITE CHALLENGING. THE ONLY THING I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THIS BOOK IS THE LACK OF MEASUREMENTS(ESPECIALLY FINISHED) SO AS TO KNOW WHICH SIZE TO MAKE."},{"Title":"The Best Of Rowan: Fifty Designer Patterns","review":"This is a beautiful book, however, it's mainly for advanced knitters. Most of the patterns have complicated colorwork requiring many, many colors (which is exactly why they're so beautiful). Only a few are textured, very very few are simple. Also, mostly they call for yarns that I don't believe Rowan makes any more. If you're comfortable with substitution, that's fine, but I wonder how difficult it would be with a pattern involving 25 colors. Also, almost all the patterns call for wool yarn and are cold-weather sweaters. i.e. almost no cotton or lighter sweaters. Many of the women's patterns are flowery and girly (which I consider a drawback as it's not my taste). I liked the men's sweaters better. Also don't get it if you're looking for children's patterns (there were only 2 or 3, mostly for girls). But I'm glad I got the book, as there are several sweaters that are simply gorgeous, and perhaps one day I'll be brave enough to attempt one. Although I got the book... at a [local] store - if I'd paid full price I might have been disappointed (I consider myself an intermediate knitter right now and haven't really done much color knitting yet.)"},{"Title":"The Best Of Rowan: Fifty Designer Patterns","review":"Interesting book, and if you are not familiar with Rowan, a good addition to your knitting library.However, many of the designs (Fassett's, among others) are already available in other books, so you might want to see how much duplication you will have. Kaffe's Classics has many of his patterns that were not in Glorious Knitting.That said, it is still a nice book."},{"Title":"The Best Of Rowan: Fifty Designer Patterns","review":"This book is GREAT! The patterns in it are absolutely beautiful. The directions are clear and easy to follow. This book isn't for \\"beginner knitters\\"; although there are a couple of somewhat easy patterns in the book. That being said, this was a great buy and an excellent addition to my knitting library."},{"Title":"The Best Of Rowan: Fifty Designer Patterns","review":"For someone looking for the \\"latest\\" in knitting styles, they will not find it here. It is however a great pattern book for those of us, like me. It has classic styles that are shaped wonderfully. You may find it difficult to find the original yarn numbers from Rowan, but that should not be a problem. Simply choose a color similar to the original color, but an updated one instead. There is a great men's sweater pattern included. The patterns are easy to read. I have found no errors in the patterns or text so far. This is a great book."},{"Title":"The Mysticism of Everyday","review":"This book by Father Carter is an amazing book! It gives a great view and much insight into mysticism and the mystical state. It does focus primarily on ordinary mysticism, but in many of the same ways ordinary mysticism is like classical mysticism (visions, etc...)Great overview and insight into Mysticism. Would strongly reccommend it to anyone looking into Mysticism etc. Father Carter himself was a mystic with a doctorate in Theology I believe. He was a Jesuit Priest and recieved many messages from Jesus and Mary. He was a very holy Priest.To view some of his other writings and the Ministry Jesus had him start, go to SofC.org . It is a ministry very devoted to Spreading Consecration to the Hearts of Jesus and Mary, helping the fulfillment of the Fatima message, and praying for/helping the Priests, the Church and the World."},{"Title":"Benchlearning: Good Examples as a Lever for Development (John Wiley Series in Information Systems)","review":"Although I could discuss their definition of Knowledge Management (KM) and therefore the distinction they make between KM and benchlearning, I found this book very, very inspiring!

Alex lays it all out there in a humorous, comical, and self effacing manner.What an enjoyable book, and a must read for all law students or those thinking of law as a career."},{"Title":"Barman","review":"This book is positively mesmerizing. I think that you will find it to be quite difficult to put down once you begin to read it. Alex Wellen has a very down-to-earth writing style and his words have the effect of drawing you seamlessly into his story. Anyone who has ever struggled through the challenges and self-doubt that are the stepping stones to achieving a hard-earned goal will find common ground with this story -- and that accounts for most of us. Wellen has blended passion, humor, and angst into his story, and I suspect that the harmony which he achieves in this eclectic mixture of emotions is no less the product of his skillful writing as it is a reflection of his own true self. This is one of those rare books which finds you rushing to get to the conclusion but a little sad when you finally reach it because you find that you have become attached to the characters. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Barman","review":"An inspiring, and at times comical tale of a young man's journey through law school, the bar exam and the attorney lifestyle. It is a candid story that tells it how it is in the cut-throat, competetive arena of New York City. It is both educational and entertaining. A must read for those interested in the legal field, and highly recommended for those with a sense of humor and an interest in a personal story that does not cease to entertain."},{"Title":"Barman","review":"This is an enjoyable, humorous book even if you aren't a lawyer and aren't planning to become one. The writing style alone makes this an entertaining book. I do think that familiarity with the bar (e.g. having a friend who took it) and/or familiarity with living in New York City would make this even more hilarious. Highly recommend as \\"just for fun\\" reading, and it does provide a worthwhile perspective on the process of becoming an attorney.Alex Wellen, please write another book!"},{"Title":"Barman","review":"Alex Wellen offers a truly compelling coming of age story.This book will speak to anyone who has struggled to find a meaningful career.

A great storyteller, Alex makes this an interesting, funny, and extremely engaging read. I could not put it down! I cannot remember a book that was this entertaining and enjoyable to me. For anyone who has ever been there, and more importantly, for anyone who never has, this is a great story you don't want to miss!"},{"Title":"Barman","review":"A friend recomended this so I bought it. I loved it! Really intersting and funny. I appreciated the unpolished perspective on a life I am pursuing."},{"Title":"Barman","review":"One of the rare gifts of good writing is an honest voice. In Alex Wellen's \\"Barman\\", you can hear his raw voice as he struggles through young adulthood and the modern rite of passage for law professionals, the bar exam. I laughed out loud, sat horrified at the inner workings of the male mind, and cheered his successes. I'm not a law student, I'm not connected to the legal profession, but none of that matters. I adored it and bought one for my brother who struggled through law school and then he sent his fellow law school grads Wellen's book. They all adored it, laughed and winced through it. I don't take the time to write reviews, but this one merits it. You'll enjoy Wellen's tales and cheer on the victories of the every-man!"},{"Title":"Barman","review":"Very hard book to put down! This guy goes through the full range of emotion - humor, stress, romance (or at least several hook-ups), personal tragedy, relief. Your start off with the author as a second year law student, go through a summer associate experience, cramming for the Bar, and finishing his first year as an associate as a New York law firm. You really grow with the guy. Personally, I liked it because I'm applying to law school, but I'd recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Barman","review":"I just finished 3 years at a reputable 3rd tier.For those of you thinking of purchasing this book, let me just tell you something quickly:Mr. Wellen uses names for his Mommy and his Daddy in his autobiography. He calls his Mommy \\"the Oracle\\" and his Daddy \\"the Optimist.\\" These names occur in his book about as often as the words 'the' 'and' i.e. alot. Now imagine switching these names back to their original meaning i.e. 'Mommy' and 'Daddy'Now further imagine, someone complaining, whining and crying that they came in 2nd place instead of 1st (out of a rat race of hundreds of thousands).What you are left with: Alex Wellen complaining to mommy and daddy that he isn't at harvard. (If a 3rd tier wrote a book, it would be more compelling and accurate of law school.)Sorry Alex, better luck next lifetime, for now you will have to just settle for $300,000 a year instead of $310,000. And read a real story like 1L"},{"Title":"Barman","review":"In a matter of a few hundred pages, Wellen takes the reader through the turbulent experience that is the decision to apply to law school, the intense preparation required for the bar exam, and finally, the practice of law. But what I enjoyed most, was that the perspective does not remain focused on our sarcastic, frustrated protagonist, but shifts to reveal the complex reactions of those non-lawyers supporting him along the way. You don't have to be an attorney to love this book. But if you are, you will absolutely find a piece of yourself inside, most likely viewed from a more uplifting, albeit bittersweet, point of view."},{"Title":"Barman","review":"If you are a neurotic 3L fast approaching the bar like me, this is NOT a good choice for leisurely reading! Heck, if you are at any stage in law school, pre-bar experience, this is probably not a good choice. It will freak you out. Like crippling, must hide the book out of my sight NOW fear! There are detailed descriptions of how many hours a day he spent between BarBri and individual studying. There are detailed descriptions of the actual essay questions and how he approached them. We all know the bar will be tough and I found out that reading pages and pages of someone else's experience was not a healthy choice for my mental well-being. Maybe when I have passed the bar, I can pick this book up and chuckle about that rough patch in my life, but right now... I'm not mentally stable enough to handle that!"},{"Title":"Barman","review":"In Barman, Temple Law graduate and aspiring lawyer Alex Wellen documents his time spent in young lawyer no man's land- between the time he graduates law school and passes the bar, becoming a \\"real\\" lawyer. Wellen's attempts to break into the elite law firm culture of New York City are relatively successful, at least compared with many of his classmates. He then faces the bar exam, for which he spends many panicked hours studying, and finally, the inevitable wait until exam scores are released, coupled with a stressful job he's not even sure if he will still have if he fails.The protagonist is generally likable, although sometimes whiny and insecure. Non-lawyers or law students, however, might find him insufferable and think his concerns unfounded. For law students, however, this book is invaluable as a primer on what to expect in those crucial months after law school, as an overview of that multi-day torture that is the bar, and a look at big firm life in general. It also touches on contentious issues in the profession itself- like the relevance of the bar to actual practice or the elitism perpetuated by the US News law school rankings."},{"Title":"Barman","review":"I was a little disappointed in this book, after having to skim through a lot of filler to find the good parts. To put it bluntly, Wellen is a nice guy who goes to a pretty good school and eventually passes the bar, but he is not successful portraying himself as entertaining, funny, glamorous, or particularly remarkable. Luckily, however, Barman contains some good information. Wellen is clear and descriptive about how he got a job in a great law firm, what he did to study for the bar, and what it was like working at a law firm while he waited for his test results. Along the way, he also demonstrates a method of interpreting legalese. If you are a prospective law student, this is a good book to check out from the library or read at the bookstore."},{"Title":"Barman","review":"Alex Wellen is a very funny fellow. I liked \\"Barman\\" because Alex tells his story in an engagingly self-deprecating way, yet his feel-it-now style reveals the dehumanizing intellectual hazing process of trying to pass the bar. I look forward to reading more of this gifted storyteller's work.John DeDakisAuthor, FAST TRACK"},{"Title":"Barman","review":"I bought Wellen's book because I am in the process of applying to law schools and may end up at a tier 2 law school, like Wellen. I wanted to read about somebody's post-law-school experience who didn't go to Harvard or Yale and Wellen did not disappoint. 90% of the time I found his self-deprecating humor left me chuckling in the way that Conan O'Brien does, but, also like Conan, the self-directed put-downs did occasionaly seem stale.His stories about first-year life at a big firm seemed insightful, although, since I've never worked for a law firm I have no way of knowing the accuracy of his account. Wellen describes schmoozing with the firm's partners, working with clients and getting laid. The book gave me what I wanted - one man's version of life at a big firm despite coming from a 2 tier school. Not outstanding, but worth 4 stars."},{"Title":"Barman","review":"Alex Wellen wrote an inspirational, educational and very funny book. I'm glad I bought it. More? I laughed out loud (rare) and cried (not quite as rare since starting law school). I found validation (everyone is afraid of the Bar) and community (Alex lived through Madison's beating and so will I, dammit!). With a family as supportive/beautiful as his we would all come to the understanding that becoming an attorney CANNOT dictate our \\"place in the universe\\"."},{"Title":"Barman","review":"I finished this hysterical offering from Alex Wellen in one splendid, heartwarming, cringe-inducing, riotously funny afternoon that left my sides hurting from all the laughter. What makes this book so wonderful is that the humor is so organic to the story; as probably any lawyer could tell you, it is representative of a seemingly universal experience for all members of the bar - the initiation ritual known as the Bar Exam. Wellen's recounting of his early experiences preparing for that endurance test, nervously awaiting the results, and anxiously attempting to please his new bosses in private practice is told with an easy, graceful familiarity that doesn't presume too much, and an achingly honest tone that makes you cringe right along with him, even as you realize you're laughing aloud (but *with* him, not *at* him!). Simply a fantastic read. Well done."},{"Title":"Barman","review":"With humour similar to David Sedaris and Bill Bryson, Wellen accurately captures the stress of law school. Wellen manages to put law school in \\"perspective\\" by sharing his own experiences in an amusing light. As a law student, it is encouraging to know that what I am going through is not unique; I made my mother read it too (she enjoyed it also). Although BARMAN is a light and easy read, I felt it was invaluable."},{"Title":"Barman","review":"My father heard the author, Alex Wellen, on the radio promoting Barman - the book about his experiences at the end of law school and the beginning of his law career. My Dad bought a copy for my brother, who loved it and passed it to me.This should be read by all third year law students. Any lawyer will certainly be able to relate. Everyone considering law school should be forced to read this book. In fact, everyone can enjoy this book.The story traces Mr. Wellen's real life experience at the end of law school He is searching for a job, juggling relationships, looking for a place to live, and most of all - studying for the bar exam. The characters are brought to life and the author does a great job of introducing the reader to his life, and bringing it to a fascinating conclusion.This book is better law school resource than Turow's 1L or The Paper Chase. Thos are about the beginning of law school, but written by (about) a elite students at an elite university. Barman is written by one of us, the other 97%. More than that, the characters are deeper and more developed, it concentrates more on the journey, and it's far funnier.As a law student, an English Literature major, and an avid reader, this is the book to read about law school, the legal profession, or just for fun."},{"Title":"Barman","review":"Barman is a fantastically fun and smart book about how it feels to come of age in the city. Wellen had the courage to break the mold of such tales. Where others have found only anomy and pathos, Wellen finds humor and hope. He doesn't ask for our sympathy when his younger self runs afoul of those ubiquitous characters from early adulthood: the evil landlord, the unstable girlfriend, the intimidating boss. He encourages us to remember what good times those were. Bright Lights, Big City be damned. Barman gets it right."},{"Title":"Barman","review":"A friend of mine loaned me this book. Thankfully I didn't spend money on it.Allow me to provide a brief summery of this book:\\"WAAAHA PITY ME I DIDN'T GO TO A FIRST TIER LAW SCHOOL! I ONLY GOT INTO CRAPPY TEMPLE THAT'S ONLY AT THE TOP OF THE CRAPPY SECOND (out of four) TEIR! BOOH HOO! I ONLY GOT IN AGAINST THE ODDS AT A SCHOOL THAT ONLY ACCEPTS FOUR HUNDRED STUDENTS OUT OF NEARLY FOUR THOUSAND WHO APPLY! WATCH ME ACT LIKE A JERK AS I TRY, AGAINST ALL THE FORCES OF FATE AND IVORY TOWER ELITISM, TO SUCCEED DESPITE THE LABLE OF \\"CRAPPY TEMPLE STUDENT\\" TATTOED LIKE A MARK OF CAIN ACROSS MY BROW!\\"My overwhelming temptation, if I ever met this guy on the street, would be to inform him that I, too, like nearly everybody else in this 'inspired by real events' POS, deep down think he's a flaming loser. I could rant at length. Instead, I will address a few remarks to Temple Law's admissions staff.Why the hades did you let this loser in rather than somebody who'd have worked with what they had rather than spent so much time and paper malingering over what they felt they deserved, and then feel like they succeeded DESPITE their school rather than BECAUSE of it? I tutored no less than three people for the LSAT who desperately wanted to go to Temple Law, and not one of them got in to ANY second OR third tier school. All of them had plenty of experience in making the most of the cards they're dealt and would've been a better alumni than this pathetic clown, who grates and annoys and makes himself sound like something closer to Forrest Gump than a legal eagle from the first sentance until the last.All I can say in closing is: thank freaking hell he's not from MY law school, I'd be freaking ashamed rather than just intensely annoyed."},{"Title":"Barman","review":"There comes a time in the education of all law school students when they ask themselves: is it too late to fake my death, change names and become a janitor? Alex Wellen's BARMAN perfectly captures the soul-sucking process that precipitates this question. In his very funny memoir, Wellen recounts dealing with the quiet humiliations of attending a second tier law school, scoring a demeaning summer internship, cramming for the New York bar exam and landing his First Big Job-- sorting through documents in a stuffy room without windows. A dash of \\"Sex in the City\\" is woven throughout as well, as Wellen grapples with the challenges of building relationships and a professional identity at the same time. Most of all, this is an awfully well-rounded coming of age tale that will appeal to everyone, but particularly to anyone mulling a legal career. Proceed not lest ye read this book!"},{"Title":"Barman","review":"picked up 'Barman' looking for information, any information, on what law school, post law school experiences were like for someone not coming from Yale or Harvard. What I learned from Alex Wellen's book was not just what the process of becoming a lawyer was like, because during the process--with he relates with wit and honesty--Wellen seemed to discover for himself that passing the bar, and becoming a lawyer didn't necessarily define who he was or his worth. It didn't change who he was. I think it's worth remembering for anyone considering law school. What I got out of reading 'Barman' was that if I try, whether I fail or succeed, I will come out a different person on the other side of the experience, but still a person; one with value and who deserves happiness. It's a healthy way to approach law school, life or any other challenge, and maintain a sense of self without getting swallowed up by the process. I'm sure it's a book I'll refer to again as I continue my own process of getting into law school, and beyond."},{"Title":"Barman","review":"This book was the most self-indulgent, meandering, boring piece of self-congratulation that I have read in YEARS.** Spoiler alert **The actual story in this book can be told in less than a page: Guy goes to a law school that he feels inferior for attending. He then takes the bar, finds it hard. He then gets a well-paid internship and waits months for the results while womanizing, drinking, and detailing every non-event in his narrow life. Many of his friends don't pass the bar, but guess what? Trust me, the end won't be a big surprise. When there's ten pages left in the book, and you still \\"don't know\\" if he passed the bar or not, it's natural to assume that the book won't end with our main character holding his head in his hands, mourning his failed career in law. (Although that would be the greatest ending EVER for this book, as it would provide some catharsis for the reader).Essentially what grates so much about this book is not the painfully long boring asides about the author's mundane personal life (although the rambling, frat-boy anecdotes set my teeth on edge), but the sheer arrogance of the narrative voice. This is an author that uses cutesy names to express his respectful affection for his parents, and in the next breath explains how he and his buddies rank unsuspecting women at parties or on the street (using terms like \\"bring it\\" or \\"keep it\\") Ick. We are regaled with stories about his robust dating life, but these stories always end with character slurs on the women he dates, or some mutual parting of the ways (yeah, right), never a moment of rejection or honesty. When we finally reach the breathless denouement of the story and learn whether or not he passed the bar (whoop-dee-do), we are treated to a little after-word about the author's sucess in contributing to an obsure cable television show (take THAT doubters!). Actually, I think he should have called this book \\"Take That, Doubters\\". And he should have dedicated it to himself, since obviously he has some sort of a complex about his competence. Honestly, who cares? (That would be my second choice of title for this book, \\"Who Cares? Tales Of A Narcissistic Lawyer\\") The only interesting thing in this book is the in-depth description of a standardized test (the bar). That isn't enough to create a compelling novel, which brings me back to the title of this review..."},{"Title":"Barman","review":"It's nearly a decade since I started law school, and over five years since I sat for the New York bar exam. The novelty of \\"Barman\\" lies in the fact that its author, unlike the writers of \\"The Paper Chase\\" and \\"One-L\\", didn't go to a top tier law school. Alex Wellen went to Temple, ranked by U.S. News & World Report as a second tier school. I can do the author one better -- my midwestern law school didn't reach Tier 2 until after I graduated, and dropped out again this year. I also didn't finish in the top 10% of my class, as did Wellen, and had to wait a lot longer to land with a NYC law firm. So my philosophy from the first chapter was that while Wellen may have had it rough, he still had a comparatively easy time compared to many of us among the great unwashed.As I was familiar with Wellen's journey, I paid more attention to the mechanics of his writing, bearing in mind his opening caution that his book was inspired by true events. Most readers may not know, for example, that Wellen described taking a portion of the New York bar exam (the multistate performance test) that wasn't introduced until several years later. Also, the thinly-veiled description of his law firm becomes even thinner if you study the patent on the final page of the book (this may have been intentional, of course). Finally, after describing every moment of his nine month journey from law school graduation through swearing-in to the bar, Wellen informs us in a very brief quota that he quit the profession less than a year later.I mention these points only to praise with faint damns. I can't think of too many other things wrong with \\"Barman\\". Wellen captures the emotional spiral of studying for the bar quite effectively. So too does he capture the dread of waiting for results, and of looking for signs and portents in such miniscule details as the size of the envelope in which his results were delivered. The state of Michigan pulled a similar nasty trick on me in November 1998.One final caveat: Large portions of this book escape the law altogether. Whereas One-L hardly ever ventured beyond the Harvard campus, Barman stretches from the wild West of Oregon to hostel laundry rooms in Western Europe. We get a lot of stories from Wellen's social life (most of his girlfriends did not wait for the third date to express their affection) as well as his slapstick attempts to convert his TriBeCa loft into a swingin' bachelor pad. These episodes add texture to Wellen's law school routine and help prevent the book from becoming monotonous.Girlfriends of potential law students may cast off their worries, however: not all of us who survived law school had as much fun as Wellen."},{"Title":"Barman","review":"I've read basically every major law school book (1L, Anarchy and Elegance, Planet Law School etc.) and this is my favorite. It's the most real. Alex Wellen has a refreshing and inspiring take on law school and life as a new associate. It's also pretty damn funny (I actually read some parts out loud to my mother and girlfriend and they were really cracking up). It's easy to get jaded vert quickly by law school and the early stages of the job process and this book is a must read for anyone in need of a good laugh about the lunacy of the whole experience."},{"Title":"Barman","review":"FIVE (5) TYPES of people should absolutely purchase BARMAN: 1) ASPIRING law school students; 2) CURRENT law school students; 3) ANYONE who has ever taken a bar exam and enjoys a good laugh, or cry; 4) ATTORNEYS who would enjoy reminiscing about the beginnings of their legal careers; 5) LAW PROFESSORS so that they may reaquaint themselves with this painful and at times absurd process. If you don't fall into any one of the FIVE TYPES above but know someone who does buy it for them- it's a great primer for the legal wannabe.BARMAN is funny, honest, and best of all accurate in its portrayal of typical law school life and the birthing process of &quot;baby&quot; lawyers via the bar exam. The best part of the story is that the author's experiences are &quot;par for the course&quot; when it comes to the majority of law school students. Wellen attended a good but not &quot;great&quot; law school. Readers will relate to Wellen's story because most of us did not get into our &quot;dream&quot; school. What unfolds in BARMAN is a story that 98% of law school types will immediately recognize as true. That is why BARMAN will endure as recommended reading for those who think that they want to become a lawyer."},{"Title":"Barman","review":"Alex Wellen has captured the American Law School Experience. More than that - Alex has written a compelling modern coming-of-age tale. This is a must read for anyone in law school, considering lawschool, and anyone who just wants to enjoy themselves immersed in a good book! Laugh endlessly while reflecting on the greater meaning of life. Discover that the end is worth the journey, and the journey doesn't always end where you think it will."},{"Title":"Barman","review":"Like other reviewers have said he does bitch about his law school ranking throughout the entire book. Stating the rank of everyone he meets law school gets annoying. Other than that it is a very good book. I have read several books that are very similar to this... law school, law firm.... but the main focus in BARMAN was... the bar exam (if you couldn't tell) which is rarely in other similar books, so its nice to see that part of the story. GOOD BOOK."},{"Title":"Barman","review":"A great primer for anyone of any age contamplating law school or preparing for the Bar. A great read--one you will pass on, again and again. Buy this book!"},{"Title":"Barman","review":"As a graduating law student that is panicking about the prospect of taking the bar, this was a perfect book to read right now. It was a light and funny easy read that provided some much needed comic relief as well as even some unexpected insight.I definately think this book is probably much more amusing for law students, lawyers, or people who have lawyers or law students in their family -- the author puts to words a common experience that so many have faced. I might think that for some non-lawyers certain passages or details about substantive law or even the bar exam might seem unnecessarily drawn out. (actually, that might be true for the legal readers also). (However, there were only a handful of those, and on balance the book gives the non-lawyer clear insight into this world).Overall, the author is able to articulate with great clarity the peculiarities of legal culture, and its own hierarchy. Also, as some reviewers have noted, I was pleased how he does not unnecessarily go out of his way to be hypercritical about the legal profession. Not that its bad to be critical, but you don't necessarily want to read hundreds of pages of someone else's rant about their disenchantment -- which is what I was originally afraid it would be. Wellen point outs the profession's flaws with appropriate irreverence, but his tone is very even and is more in the manner of descriibng something for what it is and letting the reader decide what their conclusions are. And you get the sense overall that he does have respect for the profession, although I note in the jacket cover that he no longer practices.Overall, it was a good fun book."},{"Title":"Pay for Profit: Designing An Organization-Wide Performance-Based Compensation System","review":"This is an excellent book detailing a system that is philosophically, theoretically, and methodologically sound. It details common problems in organizations, examines the practices that maintain these problems, and offers a system by which they may be addressed. The only trouble with it is that it wasn't proofread that well and, as a result, may at times cause confustion with the reader."},{"Title":"Pay for Profit: Designing An Organization-Wide Performance-Based Compensation System","review":"The Abernathy approach is the best I have seen for Pay for Performance. Several of my clients have implemented the concepts very successfully. The first chapters on entitlement thinking and the harm it does to business, and how easy it is for leaders to be blind to these effects is unique and quite eye opening. The previous was more descriptive, Managing without Supervising. The title before that, Sin of Wages, equally informative."},{"Title":"Shadows of War (Twilight of the Clans VI, Battletech, Book 40)","review":"But not to say that there were a few mistakes as well. As I read in one of the other reviews, the fact that authors do &quot;rehash&quot; facts about past events does get tedious. Although it is required for some new readers to the area, much of it is unecessary. And Operation Bulldog did come through almost intact does raise some questions, especially when Task force serpent was almost completely destroyed. And it was composed of some of the most elite units in the inner sphere. The book was interesting, and I do look forward to the next episode, I hope that they fix some of the more questionable happenings in the plot."},{"Title":"Shadows of War (Twilight of the Clans VI, Battletech, Book 40)","review":"Overall, this is a good book that well portrays the horrors of war. It is well written, and one is never quite sure who is going to win the final battle on the Clan home world. The characters are well written and act more like real people, instead of superhuman characters who have no negative emotions or thoughts. The storyline is well laid out and flows very well. The only problem with the book was the ending, because just as the Clanners are about to win, reinforcements arrive from the now 2 year old Star League. This causes the end to degenerate into a \\"cavalry to the rescue\\" scenario."},{"Title":"Shadows of War (Twilight of the Clans VI, Battletech, Book 40)","review":"I thought that Battletech novels had hit an all time low with 'SWORD AND FIRE'. I was wrong. This represents the new achievment for poorly written Sci-Fi. If you stick this book Next to ANYTHING written by Michael Stackpole, you will kill your self laughing. Give us Stackpole, Charrette and Coleman."},{"Title":"Shadows of War (Twilight of the Clans VI, Battletech, Book 40)","review":"Shadows of War was a very good book if you are looking for constant action. Unlike Grave Covenent (Twilight of the Clans II), this one is filled with suspense and an overall mood that says, &quot;What the heck are we going to get through this?!&quot; Its great and a definite must read. One bad thing about it is that the ending is rather disappointing."},{"Title":"Shadows of War (Twilight of the Clans VI, Battletech, Book 40)","review":"Oh well, not too bad, but where is the personal touch of individuals with other individuals. Gressman is OK but he's no Stackpole. An oh by the way WHAT the H*LL is happening with Victor Davion????"},{"Title":"Shadows of War (Twilight of the Clans VI, Battletech, Book 40)","review":"The last Gressman book left some huge voids and chasms, only it seems for this one to fill. Everything negative in my review about #5 seems to have been addressed here. The story is involving, the combats are alive, and before you know it you're done the whole book. Can't wait for Prince of Havoc (last word December...)."},{"Title":"Shadows of War (Twilight of the Clans VI, Battletech, Book 40)","review":"This book was a good try, but some of the chapters were a little slow. Also, am I to believe that despite their better technology, skills, and warrior spirit, the Jaguars are beaten on a rather consistant basis by the &quot;inferior&quot; Inner Sphere forces(this is a problem in other BT series too)? Anyway, the book is worth reading, but I hope the next one is better. Maybe this time the clans will actually kick some butt too."},{"Title":"Shadows of War (Twilight of the Clans VI, Battletech, Book 40)","review":"A valiant effort but in the end it left me very unsatisfied. The problem with doing books based on Battletech is that sometimes the Mechs and the combat seem to overshadow the storyline. Don't get me wrong, there were some very good parts and the battles were written very well. But in the end it's just too much. There are so many battles in the book that for the most part the larger story is ignored.I've had mixed feelings about the whole Twilight series in general. I'm not sure I really agree having a series of books done by four different authors. You sometimes end up with different feels altogether. But be that as it may I have hope for the future and will eagerly await the release of \\"Prince of Havoc\\"."},{"Title":"Shadows of War (Twilight of the Clans VI, Battletech, Book 40)","review":"Don't get me wrong, Gressman is a great B-Tech writer. But if the Twilight of the Clans had to be 8 books, they could have used this space to deal with more of the Inner Sphere during the campaign. The only reason I finished this book really fast was I got tired of hearing all the whining about how terrible war is and the toll it takes on the soldiers. It's their job, noone forced them into the military, so don't act like such a bunch of BABIES!"},{"Title":"Shadows of War (Twilight of the Clans VI, Battletech, Book 40)","review":"i didn't like it when areina winstron died. thought it was dumb. i mean, a 90 ton mech vs 70 tons? but with the clanners weapons and all, i can understand. but a cyclops vs a thor, cyclops havcing a gauss rifle? i dont think a ppc can be so accurate."},{"Title":"Shadows of War (Twilight of the Clans VI, Battletech, Book 40)","review":"Compared to most of the battletech books I have read, this one was rather poor."},{"Title":"Shadows of War (Twilight of the Clans VI, Battletech, Book 40)","review":"Imagine warfare in the 31st century. Do you imagine the slow lumbering tanks of today, or huge bipedal war machines with birdlike agility? In the Battletech trilogy the latter is what it's all about. Shadows of War is the sixth novel in the Twilight of the Clans series. Twilight of the Clans is about the downfall of clan Smoke Jaguar, but in Shadows of War the Jaguars give the Inner Sphere a hard pounding. The last five chapters are all nonstop action! There is one disadvantage though, the absence of illustrations makes it hard to envision some of the mechs. But in the back of the book are pictures of the most common mechs and vehicles! Shadows of War is a very exiting addition to the Battletech trilogy."},{"Title":"Shadows of War (Twilight of the Clans VI, Battletech, Book 40)","review":"Just finished this one. Gressman is a weaker author than Stackpole, by far, but I enjoy his work much more than Thurstons. The story is enjoyable, but lacks some credibility. Some of the battles or one on one fights left me saying &quot;no way,&quot; or &quot;just silly.&quot;Most annoying to me in the whole series has been the *lack* of information on the Inner Sphere side of the annihalation of Clan Smoke Jaguar. It's alluded to this novel, when remnants of the Smoke Jaguars come limping home from a beating given by Prince Victor, but that's it. What is probably the greatest Inner Sphere battles and history is totally glossed over. (Maybe they're leaving it for Stackpole(?))Still, like all the Twilight of the Clans series, it's a must read to keep up on the events of Operation Serpent and Operation Bulldog.A word of warning: DO NOT read the little advert for Prince of Havoc in the back of this book; to my mind it gives some major spoilers for the upcoming novel by Stackpole."},{"Title":"Shadows of War (Twilight of the Clans VI, Battletech, Book 40)","review":"Of all the books of the Twilight of Clans series, this is for sure the most martial one. Sure, some of the other books really lacked mech combat, but in this case, mass didn't mean style. Okay, a point was to be made: Warfare is brutal, bloody and no sports and in order to justify Victor S-Davion's campaign of annihilation of CSJ, his message had to be delivered with such a slaughter (on both sides) on CSJ's homeworld. And the tense timeline of this fierce battle and the dynamics of those brutal fights are a good base to get the reader's attention. But, the way Gressman describes mech combat seriously lacks the originality and depths of other btech authors (like i.e. the early Stackpole warrior trilogy). Here it's simply a chaotic string of oftenly unrelated scenes of mech combat. This woulda been accetable if Gressman had stuck with a few main characters, but alas he more than once introduces combatants in a passage and never mentions the same character again, leaving the reader wondering what happened to them. Even worse, he neglects the fate of main characters and of complete mech units. For example Russou Howell, who had been built up as main protagonist in 2-3 of the former novels just gets 2 short appearances. Or, what happened to saKhan Brandon Howell, who was skilled enough to be the only CSJ leader not to completely fail at Tukayid (InvClansSB)? What impact did the IS' reserve units have after they got summoned to reinforce the 2 main groups? Etc... Questions over questions - and not every one gets (satisfactorily) answered in the short final passages when Victor's forces arrive and the battle is decided rather abruptly. Contrary to other reader's comments I liked Gressman's detailed logistical descriptions in 'The Hunters' and he was good at that. But here, I just got the impression that Gressman either had to hurry to finish the assault on Diana or that he simply lacks the skill to span a coherent story line for such large scale mech battles. And that's what Btech is about: Mech combat. And therefore only 2 stars."},{"Title":"Shadows of War (Twilight of the Clans VI, Battletech, Book 40)","review":"Having read this book, and then the other reviews listed here, I just had to add some comments of my own. When are we, Battletech fans and followers of the workings of the Inner Sphere, going to be allowed to read well written stories on a regular basis? My first comment deals with the fact that these authors continually recap and rehash events. Throughout this book, the author continually buffets the reader with redundant information, often related in the previous chapter. Why does the reader have to be submitted to the same drivel about this or that characters's feelings over and over. Case in point: The first chapter deals with ilKahn Lincoln Ossis' plea to the Clan Council for assistance; no sooner does he arrive on Huntress, but the reader is subjected to a lengthy synopsis of the events related in the first chapter! Secondly, the reader, ostensibly one who has been following the Battletech novels (let's face it, this is not mainsteam fiction), is continually forced to read redundant decriptions of how this technology, or that weapons system works. Doesn't the author realize the majority of his readers already know this stuff? Next, let's try and stick to the basics. In battle, as in life, simple luck has a lot to do with the outcome of events. Mosts fans of Battletech know that there are no Battlemechs that can just shrug off two hits from a Gauss rifle in the same location. The forces of Operation Bulldog waxed the Smoke Jaguars during their campaign; what was wrong with Task Force Serpent? Wasn't it made up of some of the most elite units in the Inner Sphere? Weren't they using the same equipment as Bulldog? Oh yes, and how did a sword fight between two highly trained warriors, with a susequent escape from a building about to explode, occur in less than two minutes, three tops? Having said all that, let me conclude by saying that this book is still worth reading, at least to maintain a sense of what is happening in the genre. It's too bad that the events weren't portrayed more accurately and entertainingly."},{"Title":"Shadows of War (Twilight of the Clans VI, Battletech, Book 40)","review":"** Contains Spoilers **While I understand times are tight, ROC's decision to cut down page count seems to have really crimped otherwise OK writers, especially given how every single novel has to go over the same ground. We get it, 'Mechs are tough and versatile. The Clans have great technology. And so on and so forth - the redundancy of exposition in each novel is almost the amount of detail for a stand-alone story, cutting further into the reduced page count.One of my biggest complaints of the post 'Highlander Gambit' BT novels is the 'rushed' feeling. You will get errors in a series of books written by several authors at the same time. But the amount of errors and grammar per book should have easily been caught by editors.Something I've noticed is how a description or internal monologue, often almost word for word, will be repeated a few paragraphs later ON THE SAME PAGE. Another editing point is not so much structure but when descriptive words like 'huge' 'massive' etc or adjectives are used multiple times within the same paragraph and even sentence. Other errors include units of X type combating units of Y type, then either side being identified as totally different types a few sentences later.As for this book specifically;**20th century this and that, such as acronyms, names, and tactics or equipment descriptions. Battletech has a serious amount of back history yet at times I felt I was rereading 'Team Yankee'.**OK, every soldier has doubts. Yet we are constantly bombarded by the same characters' fears over and over without resolution. At the same time we are also being told, again over and over, that these commanders are all volunteers of elite units with 10-30 years of warfare behind them. Who on most levels still do not trust each other after a year plus of training and travel. Got old, fast.**Constant rehashing of the mission goals, mixed in with the aforementioned doubts/fears. Eliminating the military capacity of a single Clan with care to cause minimal civil damage is NO different than how these same Inner Sphere forces have waged moderate intensity warfare since after the 2nd Succession War. Yet we are asked to believe these veteran soldiers feel they are doing something entirely new and heinous.**One of the major battles is supported by artillery as the Clans come into combat range. When the Clan forces are repulsed they are simply LET GO with no further artillery or aerospace harassing attack. Yet, the point of the invasion was to eliminate the Smoke Jaguars militarily. Having to keep fighting the same units again is contrary to the IS goals.**Despite the Clans having superior electronic gear, a night attack is mounted on a significant SJ force. Yet once again, despite air and artillery superiority at the time, the 'veteran' IS forces simply attempt a 'Mech attack.**The part involving Lincoln Osis being wounded was utterly ridiculous. Nekekami commandos infiltrate and rig for demolition the SJ command center with 5 minute timers. They then head out, just happening to run into the Khan and his guards whom are quickly eliminated. The Spirit Cat leader decides to duel Osis after conversing with him; apparently Osis can use a sword well enough to have a chance versus a ninja assassin.The duel near fatally wounds both fighters, with the Clan Khan immobilized. Yet suddenly a 'random' security patrol of Elementals finds him, manages to have one member dis-armor to drive a 'found' hovertruck, and evacuate the Khan just before the building blows.So we get a surprise encounter, a conversation, a duel, and a rescue ALL WITHIN 5 Minutes?!**Operation Bulldog forces show up in the midst of the climactic battles after having waged war and traveled on the heels of the defeated SJs? Please.While it was nice to finally get to the invasion of Huntress after the long journeying and chapter-long ship battles of the previous novels 'Shadows of War' was pretty much a let down."},{"Title":"Shadows of War (Twilight of the Clans VI, Battletech, Book 40)","review":"This is a favorite of mine because not only does it have loads of 'mech battles, it has alot of other things, such as assasination attempts, dark pasts, and the commander gets killed in the final battle(cool way to go, but still a bummer).

The charts are REALLY good. So if you like to go beyond the simple, play-along-with-the-chords versions, you can play it like George wrote it. It's pretty exciting to be able to play like a forties lounge pianist -- moving bass and big open jazz chords. It's accurate too. All you have to do is add a bit of swing. Of course, the tuxedo and tip glass are optional. &quot;They Can't Take That Away From Me&quot; is the quintessential American reminisce. In a certain way, Ira's wistful lyric -- &quot;Our romance won't end on a sorrowful note. Though by tomorrow you're gone&quot; -- is reminiscent of Brazilian bossa nova lyrics. Both recognize the inevitable failure of love but focus on the memory that remains. This one song alone makes it worth putting the book in the piano bench. Unfortunately there's quite a lot of Porgie &amp; Bess. Too many &quot;Summertimes&quot; in previous lives soured me. Save me from 1930's New York liberals in &quot;I Got Plenty O' Nuttin.&quot; All in all, it's a positive experience. But unless you're great at reading charts, be prepared to slog it out.

Camporesi, a Professor of Italian Lit. at the University of Bologna, gives the reader the sights, smells, and tastes of the tables of Europe, from the lowliest of the low classes, to the pretentious dining rooms of the ruling classes. He traces food history, the introduction of &quot;new foods,&quot; such as spices, &quot;unthinkable meats,&quot; and &quot;unpredictable fruits,&quot; whether by the discoveries of trade and travel, or changes in popular attitudes. Flowers became a commodity. Food fads, foods as status symbols and tokens of refinement - are described. The birth of orangeade and lemonade, popular notions of the curative or restorative powers of one food or another, are all detailed - in an organized and satisying fashion. Camporesi covers a fascinating and thrilling subject with clarity and erudition. The book is organized into fourteen chapters, and each can be read as a separate and complete essay. Some of their titles: &quot;A Blissful and Drinkable Eternity,&quot; &quot;The Botany of the Palate,&quot; &quot;Mad and Startling Names.&quot; This book is really a must-read for any student of European social history, culinary history, or popular culture."},{"Title":"Exotic Brew: The Art of Living in the Age of Enlightenment","review":"a very decadent look at the lifestyle of EM Italians.

It plots the rise and fall of the Transcendental Self starting with its Renaissance birth as described by Rousseau . From there the book progresses in a logical and roughly chronological manner to a very informative discussion of Kantian ethics and the Self as well as German Idealism. ( great reading for scholars interested in Germanic development in the last 300 years.) He devotes about ten short but information packed pages to the apex of the Transcendental Self as represented in Hegelian Thought. His attention to &quot;der List der Vernunft&quot; - the cunning of reason - as Hegels' reaction to the despair and Dostoevsky-like bitterness of post Napoleonic Europe is very well laid out. In a world no longer willing to accept the Will of God argument as a explanation of the brutality of mankind Hegel gives the world a grim consolation. Behind it all there is a rational process, a teleological argument - its is the Cunning of Reason. It is a wasteful but purposeful process that manifests in the Hegelian Dialectic.But this process also ultimately have expanded the idea of the Transcendental Self beyond the indivudual of Schelling and Fichte. This individual is no longer important - the dialectic development deals in the Cunning of Reason not with individuals but only with nations/peoples. At this point it would have been apt of the author to point to the obvious - the development of the nation state (think of National Socialism and Communism in the twentieth century)as a type of reactionary effort to rediscover the Transcendental Self albeit in Hegelian form.In such a way Hegel sows the seed for the collapse of the Transcendental self as exemplified in the thoughts of Schopenhauer, the British Empiricists and of course Nietsche. His chapter on Nietsche is a high point and my favourite. His handling of Feuerbach Marx and Kierkegaard is concise but sufficient in their attempt at dealing with the loss of a Absolute.The book them moves eloquently to the next evolutionary phase - that of the Self rediscovering the self ( the individual ) Stripped of its Absolutes ,the magnitude of the Hegelian dialectic as seen of nation level gets personal. Husserl and his desperate search for a logical method to discover the Absolute fails in it epistemological fantasies. In the end Husserl declares - Der Traum is ausgetraumt -the dream is finished (loose translation) He then progresses to Freud and Wittgenstein as classical examples of the Hegelian outer world becoming a equally vast and cunning inner world where man is not always master of his own house.The book then reaches another peak with the discussion on Heidegger and Hermeneutics. His explanation of Dasein is the clearest that I have read but his handling of Gadamers' refinements of Hermeneutical thought is not adequate enough for me.The final Death of the Self is brilliantly concluded in the discussions of the French existentialists and Structuralism (mainly Derrida) His critique of Derrida is insightful and makes one desire more from the authorThe ending paragraph sums it all up:\\" Between the Self as Absolute Spirit and the Self as nothing at all there seems to be very little difference.\\""},{"Title":"Sitting Bull: Dakota Boy","review":"I picked up this children's book thinking that it might be appropriate for my church's library (a Native American Episcopal Mission). After reading it, I'm not really sure if it is appropriate. The story is exciting. The character of Jumping Badger (later to be Sitting Bull) is strong and develops well. The illustrations, while not marvelous, are fine. Values and morals are taught fairly well in this novel.One of a few things that worried me (as a Santee Sioux person) was the use of the denigrating and dehumanizing word \\"squaw\\" throughout the book. Among my people, it would be a great, great insult to call a woman such a terrible thing. I think if the story were to be re-edited, the wonderful word \\"woman\\" could be placed in those instances. Another instance that worried me was the calling one woman a \\"witch\\". While there have always been \\"medicine women\\" throughout many ages, the use of the word takes the reader to another place that is not consistent with Dakota/Lakota/Nakota history and culture. An afterword by the editors on the use of the name \\"Sioux\\" and the words mentioned above may be of good use.These two instances do not deter me from recommending this book. If anything, they may lead to conversation and a better understanding of Sioux cultures (note that there are more than one) and the use of language around concepts not indigenous to our own culture, i.e., \\"witch\\" vs. \\"medicine woman\\".This is a great book for kids, but they may need a little guidance with it. I still haven't decided if it would be appropriate for my church's library and will first talk about this book with other elders."},{"Title":"Sitting Bull: Dakota Boy","review":"I love this book. It is exciting and interesting. It involves war, bravery, and honor to be a sioux!"},{"Title":"Sinan: The grand old master of Ottoman architecture","review":"Prof. Kuran's book on Sinan is an excellent introductory study for the students of Islamic architecture. I highly recommend this book to the readers of art and architectural history in general. In their library, like Goodwin's History of Ottoman architecture, this colossal book will be a main source of reference on Ottoman architecture. It relates the life and deeds of the creator of a unique tradition. In this book, you can discover that, very similar to the evolution we see in pre-modern European architecture, there was a development from classical to post-classical in Ottoman architecture. This book contains detailed descriptions of Sinan's grand and relatively minor structures and includes a catalogue of buildings and an extensive bibliography at the end. As a matter of fact, it is the end-product of Prof. Kuran's attempt to create a series of colossal studies on Turkish architecture in Anatolia. He began with Seljukid madrasas, continued through Early Ottoman mosques and concluded with Sinan's buildings.

A picture of the natural grandeur of America's greatest cemetery would be an ideal accompaniment and give some idea of what I mean when I use words like \\"beautiful\\" in connection with a burial ground. This is an extraordinary book with an extraordinary subject. Spring Grove Cemetery and Arboretum has spent the past 160 years as one of the most carefully maintained and precisely landscaped spaces on planet earth. Yes, it is a cemetery, and yes, 'neath its verdant, tree-filled lawns the death do lie a-moldering and all that, but even laying aside the fact that among its miles and miles of roadways EVERY species of tree and shrub native to this section of North America may be found, it is still a place like no other. The architecture here has been known to make the living envy the dead. The famous lie here, the moneyed, the humble, the great and small. Spring Grove has tombs the like of which are not found anywhere else. Gothic mausoleums stand next to Victorian cenotaphs, Revolutionary War veterans lie next to Civil War generals, famed pioneers are in Spring Grove, and so are the movers and shakers of regional, national and international fame. Everyplace you look in this sprawling suburb of the dead (so vast it's a pleasure to get lost inside it) are scenes of nature's glory and humankind's creative genius. Forget modern memorial parks with their unifying themes of decoration and flat little \\"markers\\" atop carefully hidden graves, in Spring Grove death is not feared, it is glorified as only our mid-19th century forebears knew how.This cemetery and nature preserve is one of earth's treasure sites and this book tells its history and details its uniqueness for those far and wide."},{"Title":"Spring Grove: Celebrating 150 Years","review":"Working not too far from Spring Grove cemetary provides an opportunity to spend my Friday lunch hour there.

Now, I am disappointed to see that it is currently unavailable as I would jump on the chance to purchase it.

Otherwise, the book is excellent of course, since Ann Rule is a genius at crime writing. In 1972 Laura Leslie Brock disappeared while hitchhiking in Washington state. Her body was later found. Mary Miller read the newspaper story to her 15 year old daughter because they always talked about these kind of things so the daughter would know about the world. How horrible when in 1973 the daughter read a want ad for a job and agreed to meet someone, who turned out to be involved in the Laura Leslie Brock murder! You won't be able to put this book down. And it doesn't get too involved in the court case either. Ann Rule's later books might be more well crafted but this one has genius written all over it too."},{"Title":"The Want-Ad Killer","review":"&quot;The Want Ad Killer&quot; represents good early Ann Rule when, for whatever reason, she wrote as Andy Stack. It is the frightening tale of Harvey Carignan, a serial killer who terrorized young women in both the Seattle and Twin Cities during the late '70s. The all too apt title refers to a teenage girl who was abducted after answering a &quot;planted&quot; classified ad. &quot;WAK&quot; is short, concise, no nonsense true crime. It is told as a police story, with little courtroom drama or legal maneuvering. There are also none of the longer, more involved sub plots of the authoress' later stories such as &quot;And Never Let Her Go&quot; or &quot;Everything She Ever Wanted&quot;, making this a good choice for readers unfamiliar with her work. For the few Ann fans that have yet to read &quot;WAK&quot;, don't think twice. A word of warning: The Ann Rule rule is in effect. Do not look at the centerfold photos or the book's cover. Far too much is revealed therein. Keep yourself in suspense for as long as possible. Parents of teenage girls will keep their daughters locked up after reading this one."},{"Title":"The Want-Ad Killer","review":"This is one of Rule's best works. I have read numerous true crime books over the years and this, by far, is one of my favorites. It amazes me how such a diabolical mind was able to stay free after so many years and so many murders. I also know someone who works for the MN Dept of Corrections who speaks with Harvey on a regular basis. This cold blooded killer is alive and enjoying his regular meals and cable tv. He receives chemotherapy compliments of the taxpayers. Alaska would have saved so many so much if it had taken care of this man after his first murder."},{"Title":"The Want-Ad Killer","review":"My first adventure into reading true crime, certainly not my last. It seemed as though Ann must have been an eyewitness to Harvey Carnigan's life of crime. It was very well told, easy to follow, difficult to put down.

The former head of the Minneapolis Crime lab is a personal friend who worked on this actual case. He told me about the case before I ever read the book. After I read the book, I could tell how accurate Ann Rule depicted this true case. One attracting aspect of this book is that it fast pace, always on the move. There is never a dull moment because there can't be. This book takes you on a trip through the inner workings of a true diabolical mind. Along the way you travel to numerous parts of the United States where this hanus murder went from Alaska to Washington and finally in Minnesota where this unfortunate story ends. I also had the privelage of meeting Det. Sonnestahl who worked the Minneaoplis end of this case. This is a book that will leave a lasting imprint on your memory."},{"Title":"The Want-Ad Killer","review":"IN THE BOOK, &quot;THE WANT ADD KILLER&quot; MY NAME IS GERRY BILLINGS. I HAVE READ THE BOOK AND FOUND IT TO BE VERY FRIGHTENING. THE BOOK DESCRIBES A MONSTER, HARVEY CARIGNAN, WHICH IS SO TRUE! IT WAS VERY HARD FOR ME TO READ ABOUT THE MAN THAT HAS LEFT ME FULL OF FEAR, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, ONCE YOU START TO READ THIS BOOK, YOU JUST CAN NOT PUT IT DOWN. THE SAD THING ABOUT THIS WHOLE STORY IS THAT IT COULD HAVE ALL BEEN PREVENTED IF ONLY HARVEY HAD BEEN FORCED TO PAY FOR HIS CRIME BACK IN 1947, WHICH IS ALSO TOLD ABOUT IN THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"The Want-Ad Killer","review":"I've read other books by Ann Rule, especially NO REGRETS and GREEN RIVER RUNNING RED, so I was intrigued by this title. I had previously heard about scams involving \\"help wanted\\" ads, where unwitting people are lured into danger by scam artists looking to take advantage of people who genuinely need work, so this book seemed worthwhile reading.THE WANT-AD KILLER describes the disappearance and murder of Kathy Sue Miller, the victim who finally was responsible for bringing Harvey Carignan, a longtime \\"career criminal\\" to justice. Carignan had hit upon the idea of luring women to his gas station on the pretext of applying for a job. He placed ads in the local paper. When the job applicants refused his sexual advances, he killed them, usually with blows to the head, in a homicidal rage.Kathy Sue Miller, aged 15, was one of those girls who applied for the job she saw in the paper. Despite her mother's warning that she should not go off in a car with an unknown man for a job interview, Kathy Sue Miller got into Harvey Carignan's car, ostensibly to go to his gas station to apply for the job, and was never seen again. She had originally called the number in the paper for a job for her boyfriend, Mark, but Carignan convinced her that she could get the job herself, and she was excited at the idea of having some money of her own. Rule points out that Carignan's idea of putting a \\"want ad\\" in the paper gave him a steady supply of victims who walked right into his hands.Rule's book is skillfully written, with good insights not only into the emotional effects of this crime on the victim's family, but also on the detectives in charge of solving the crime. It serves as a well-written cautionary tale to anyone who is looking for a job, but also wants to make sure that he or she remains safe in the process."},{"Title":"The Want-Ad Killer","review":"One reviewer earlier commented that he was \\"disappointed\\" that the man ONLY KILLED ONE person in this manner!!!!!!!!!OH MY GOD!I do not think that the person means this the way it sounds... maybe he needs to go back and rewrite his review.I am sure to the young woman's family that this creep killed, one was FAR too many.Thank you..."},{"Title":"The Want-Ad Killer","review":"As with The Lust Killer, this reissue of a book that Rule apparently wrote, under the pen name of Andy Stack, is very weak in comparison to her later work.She skims over details here that later in her writing she would have included.The Courtroom scene is rather dull in this book and in the other resissues, though I suppose Courtroom scenes are inherently dull when viewing them. Still, in her later work, Rule is able to keep Courtroom scenes lively. Not here!Upon finishing this book, I felt quite disappointed. It simply isn't Rule at her best. I'd have been much happier, as an Ann Rule fan, if she'd rewritten these reissues, rather than dredging them up from the past.I found this a really mediocre read, though I surely wouldn't want to encounter Harvey in a dark alley. I wouldn't want to encounter Harvey in a brightly-lit alley, either. One of my major thoughts while reading this was, &quot;I hope to God Minnesota has changed their felonly conviction laws.&quot;I don't recommend this book...not even to Ann Rule fans."},{"Title":"The Want-Ad Killer","review":"Ann Rule's true crime books got me hooked on this genre way back in my early years, around about my twenties. 'The Want-ad Killer' hooks one immediately. It's a non-stop, eyes-bugging-out-in-horror, foray into the wee hours of the night, when all the past shadow people come spiriting into one's secret thoughts, terrifyingly real again. Like the Want-Ad Killer did to his victims, so, too, did another monster masquerading as a man, land in my life by association. In 1978, Darrell Keith Rich kidnapped, tortured, raped, and murdered a dear friend of mine, Linda Slavik. From June to August of that year, Rich kidnapped, raped, and murdered three young women, and one eleven year old child. He raped and sodomized many, many more. Reading this book echoed what happened back in 1978, in Cottonwood, CA. Disturbingly read, The Want-Ad Killer is a most revealing and frightening book, fantastically written and researched by Ann Rule. I highly recommend this book if you'd like an insight into the mind of one of the many fiends who have fooled their victims so cleverly, and so devastatingly. If you think this can't happen in your own life, among your own circle of friends and family, then think again. I lost a precious friend because of a sociopath just like this one Ann's written about. Six degrees of separation? Sometimes it's even less."},{"Title":"The Want-Ad Killer","review":"Even though you know the end results of what Ann Rule writes about, she presents the story in a way that keep your interest.

I still would recommend the book if you like her work.She did a good job illustrating this slimy, sleaze-ball, nut job, sicko from hell. No other way to describe him!"},{"Title":"The Want-Ad Killer","review":"Documents the life and crimes of serial sex slayer Harvey Carignan, who, if it had not been for an inexcusible flaw in the justice system, was freed to wreak havoc and terror on unsuspecting teenage girls and women. This story certainly makes you wonder which side the law is on - the convicted felon's side or the innocent victims and potential victim's side, and you will question whether the laws really do work. In this case they didn't, and because of this, women and girls who today would be alive are long dead and long forgotten, except by their families and friends. It also documents the genesis of one of the most well respected and influential victim's rights group in America today - Families and Friends of Missing Persons and Violent Crime Victims. This group was started in 1976 by four women, one of whom who had lost her own teenaged daughter to Harvey Carignan's lethal brutality, and is still continuing its important work a quarter of a century later."},{"Title":"The Want-Ad Killer","review":"The concept of a killer placing want-ads to attract victims is quite fascinating. I was disappointed to learn the Harvey Carignan only did this with one victim. Because of this, I think the title is a little deceiving. While not being Ann Rule's best book, \\"Want-Ad Killer\\" is a solid read.Carignan's crime spree should have ended in Alaska after his first murder. Unfortunately, he became a free man because of legal technicality. After moving to Washington, he left a trail of rape and murder that ended in Minnesota. Preying on teenage girls, he lured his first victim as a free man through a want-ad. After the police surveillance became too much, he shifted his crime spree to Minnesota. It is difficult to ascertain how many victims he had there. But the ones he allowed to live ended his crime spree.Having read some of Rule's other books, I was a little disappointed with this one. It was still an enjoyable read as Rule is one of the best true crime writers in print."},{"Title":"The Want-Ad Killer","review":"If you like true crime at it's best you have just met the master."},{"Title":"The Want-Ad Killer","review":"I wish more of Ann Rules books were for kindles. Some of the older ones are not available, and i really enjoy her books"},{"Title":"The Want-Ad Killer","review":"\\"The Want Ad Killer\\" is one on Ann Rule's older books. She used to write for true detective magazines, and her earlier works show a no-nonsense writing style which has evolved over the years. In her more recent stories, Ann Rule delves into the past of the killer, doing her best to answer the curious reader's question: WHY? The quality that makes Ann Rule the very best true crime writer is her in-depth research and psychological insight in exploring what makes the killer tick. I feel that she did this to a greater extent in \\"The Want Ad Killer\\" than she did in her other early books \\"Lust Killer\\" and \\"The I-5 Killer\\". Harvey Carignan was always the unwanted, troublesome child. Still, I think if Ann were writing this today, there would be more in-depth character development, and that is what I miss here. I love the detail present in Rule's more recent books. If you are interested in true crime, this is worthwhile reading. Even Ann Rule's earliest books are better than 99% of the true crime writing out there today."},{"Title":"The Want-Ad Killer","review":"ann rule is such a great write, and i have almost all her books. there is so much about the actual investigation process and the way she writes, its like a good novel, but just knowing that its all true is pretty freaky.its good reading.. .totally worth the money."},{"Title":"The Want-Ad Killer","review":"The title of this true crime account of Harvey Carignan's vicious assaults and murders is a little misleading. You might think Carignan lured young women to respond by repeatedly placing ads in match-up/lovelorn columns. Actually, he didn't often seem to use newspaper ads to attract victims. On the few occasions he did use that ploy, he was advertising for help at his gas station. So don't read this book expecting to find another \\"Lonely Hearts Killer.\\" Many of Carignan's victims were victims of opportunity - hitchhikers or girls stranded by the side of the road.Also, don't expect to read about a lot of fancy forensics. This book was an early entry in Ann Rule's true crime series. She wrote it in the 1980's, and it describes crimes committed in the 60's-70's and before. So there's no DNA or other high-tech investigation. Most of the detective work is simple dogged persistence.It is a relief though that the detective work described here, unlike the investigations of so many other crimes you read about, didn't involve a lot of miscommunication and leads that got lost in the smoke of inter-departmental rivalries. There's a little of that, but most of the frustration involved in the Carignan case centers around the official need to allow Carignan his legal loopholes and to delay arresting him pending the accumulation of solid evidence. Meanwhile, the suffering of victims mounts. So as you read this, you might find yourself thinking of ways in which the balance can be restored between the public's right to safety and the accused's right to due process.Most of your attention though will probably be absorbed just reading about and fearing for the victims. As ever, Ann Rule paints you into the scene, watching, waiting, worrying. Rule has the gift of evoking the tragedy with telling detail. One mother long had premonitions of some horrible fate that would befall her daughter. Her unease increases as she waves what she still thinks is a routine good-bye to the girl, looking at her through the \\"smudged\\" window of a bus. Such simple common details as the obscuring, erasing smudge on a bus window is what gives these chronicles their special poignancy.This \\"Updated Edition\\" includes some of the results of a revealing interview with Carignan."},{"Title":"The Want-Ad Killer","review":"This is an early Ann Rule true crime story about Harvey Carignan who used the want ads to lure unsuspecting, young female victims.Ann Rule goes back to the cases in Alaska where Carignan beat a hanging sentence on a technicality.Carignan is a sociopath,but far from insane. He is intelligent and knows criminal law and constitutional rights well enough to have written papers on the subjects during an earlier stretch in prison.The author defines the difference between a sociopath and a psychotic.She mentions the possibility that Carignan may have been involved in the Piper kidnapping, although the evidence is weak.The maps with the interesting markings showing some known burial sites gives rise to the concern that he vented his hatred of women far more times than has been known. The numerous unexplained markings loosely match some unsolved murders with similar M.O. in areas that Carignan passed through. He may have been an earlier version of a roaming killer much like Tommy Lynn Sells. One difference between Carignan and other notorious serial killers is the physical nature of Carignan, he was large,muscular and didn't shy away from fights with men.\\"The Want-Ad Killer\\" may not be Ann Rule's best book, but it is fast-paced and an interesting choice of subject in Harvey Carignan."},{"Title":"The Want-Ad Killer","review":"Harvey Carignan is a prime example of why the US Constitution so frequently works against victims while offering loopholes for perpetrators; often setting them free to repeat their crimes as is this case with Carignan. On the side of the fence, readers develop sympathy for Mary Miller, whose daughter was the first known victim of Carignan after most recent prison release.Ann Rule, despite this being one of her early works, does an outstanding job of providing an in-depth look into the childhood, teenage years and adulthood of Carignan. Much of what we learn is based on Carignan's \\"accusations\\" and Rule does a superb job of noting that, most likely, this are just what they are...only accusations.While the title is a bit deceptive (Carignan only murdered one young girl, that is known, from a classified ad), the overall content of the book is intense and intriguing; so much so that I completed the book within 24 hours.This is the last of the Ann Rule books I had not read to date.

More than anything else I think it was Esther and her descriptions that absolutely gripped me from the very first word.While reading the book, many times I tried to question my own sanity and what I was going through and quite surprisingly this book I felt dealt with so many issues that we all go through some or the other time in our lives. Esther's struggle with issues and people around her gave me an inkling into what was I facing with people around me. It's not more of madness than being sane that made me love this book and what it stands for - probably suffocation, probably the need to get away so many times when we are unable to do so. The probability of meeting someone nice and sensitive which never really works that way.Grappling with oneself and situations can be quite a thing to undertake. Most of the times, many of us choose to push things under the rug without paying attention to our thoughts and problems. Esther on the other hand chooses to look inside and find answers which probably is best summed up in the following lines from the book,&quot;How did I know that someday--at college, in Europe, somewhere, anywhere--the bell jar, with it's stifling distortions, wouldn't descend again?&quot;This quote becomes all the more poignant when one discovers that only a month after The Bell Jar, her first novel, was published, Sylvia Plath took her own life.

As I read the book, I really felt as if I was Esther Greenwood, herself. As Esther began to suffer her mental breakdown, so did I, and as she felt nothing was really wrong with her, so did I. I had to stop reading and think... this woman IS crazy and in need of help, even though I didn't really feel that as I was reading. And as Esther began to get better, I felt as if all the fogginess of her life slowly began to clear.

So, whether you like Plath's poetry or not if you like a book that is deep, yet a fast read, I would definately read this book."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"&quot;The Bell Jar&quot; is a dramatic and touching book following the life of the young woman named Esther Greenwood. I personally enjoyed this book to a high degree. Sylvia Plath takes the reader on a trek, where we view the downfall and destruction of the book's heroin, Esther. Esther starts her post college year as an aspiring writer doing what people that age do. She attends parties and bars, leading the life of a normal 23 old woman. However, Esther enters a downward spiral into a world of entrapping depression. I like this book for the complicated and well structured plot system which Plath provides for the reader. I especially enjoyed how the book so well introduces us and acquaints us with Esther. Around the first few pages, Esther speaks of her constant desire to eat. This kind of common thought dialogue so easily acquaints us with Esther, therefore understanding and liking her. Thus by witnessing her thoughts, we feel overbearing sympathy for Esther as she slowly but surely enters a dark and gray realm of anger and depression. Plath does well at structuring Esther's downfall. Not just one event makes her break down to her knees, but the sum of small futile events. All of Esther's colleagues around her prosper with significant others and job lives, as she is blatantly turned down by an eccentric man and as she loses a chance to write a powerful article which she very much wanted. There Esther sits, in a bell jar as an observer. She observes everyone around move forward on the road of life, as she sits back watching everyone disappear in the far distance. Certain points of the book seem to drag on, losing some feel to Plath's writing. For a clump of pages, Esther continuously speaks of her ex-boyfriend, Buddy Willard, which gets old really quickly. Truthfully, I do not have much negative to say about Sylvia Plath's only novel. It is a very moving book with dazzling imagery as well as many poetic gestures. I wouldrecommend this book to anyone with an open mind. If you read this book and say &quot;What a crazy lady,&quot; then this book was NOT for you. If you have an open mind to these types of situations, then this is the book for you. Girls might enjoy it more than men because since Esther is a female, girls can obviously relate much easier than guys can."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Sylvia Plath entered this world in 1932 and decided for herself it was time to leave, amidst a turmoil of tragedies, on February 11, 1963.The Bell Jar is basically a semi-autobiographically novel of her madness, self-destruction, and struggle with her oppressor. The bell jar is symbolic for the pressures society has placed on her. This novel shows her inability to free herself from the constrictions placed on her life and thus, this begins her slow breakdown of her mental entity. Her road to recovery begins with shock therapy, which only results in resentment. The novel is mixed with despair, almost a confessional call for help and her insecurity.Her words are so brilliantly eloquent, yet Plath writes in such a succinct and simple way, that any reader will be able to absorb her works and interpret them in his or her own way.I definitely recommend this book, whether or not you've ever read any of the other Plath's works."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I reread the Bell Jar every couple of years and have done so since I was 18. It's so much more than a morbid ride or a thinly-veiled autobiography. It's one of few great coming-of-age stories that we have as women. I've long since stopped reading this book as a glimpse into Sylvia's soul or coming suicide. I've also stopped reading it as a precursor to the coming feminist movement of the 1960s. I'm drawn back to it again and again because it's simply a well-told story. It's subtle, complex and occasionally very very funny."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"A largely autobiographic novel, The Bell Jar is a story of depression and mental illness. Esther is a poor student from a small town, on a scholarship to do guest editing for a New York magazine. Her time in New York, obsession with the power than men have over her, and own apathy gradually lead to a mental breakdown. Institutionalization, shock therapy, and suicide attempts follow, all closely mirroring Plath's own history. Written honestly, with great skill and talent, The Bell Jar gives insight into depression and mental illness and tells a very personal, depressing, unique story. It's a hard book to sum up and even to talk about, but I recommend it very, very highly to all readers.As fascinating as this book was, as clear as the writing is, I find it difficult to talk about. The Bell Jar is perhaps the best memoir/book on depression and mental illness, providing a very human, realistic, and identifiable view of depression from the inside out. Plath writes so clearly that it is impossible not to understand her protagonist and the events in her life. As such, it's an informative, invaluable novel which allows the reader to understand, even experience, a point of view that would otherwise be unknown to them--and so it can be a very emotional book to read.Besides this measure of intrinsic value, the novel simply reads and moves well. It is a memoir, not an detective story or a romantic novel, and as such the plot isn't the focus: rather, it is characters and experiences that matter. The honest, gritty memoir is reminiscent of The Catcher in the Rye (although, I would say, much better). But the story is still compelling: not matter how gritty, even through the mental breakdowns, Esther is so well-written that the reader ca identify and sympathize with her throughout. Furthermore, the text reads smoothly and quickly while still chronicling some truly harrowing and depressing events. The book is compelling, well-written, and worthwhile not only as a memoir of depression but also as a skillful novel.The rest of my thoughts about the text are lengthy rambles on women, madness/mental illness, and writing, but they are out of place here. The only thing to leave you with is a strong recommendation of The Bell Jar. Read it--there's nothing more complex than that. It is an accessible novel, both in length and writing style; it is skillful, a masterly work; the description of depression, of treatment, of interaction with the rest of the world is worthwhile for anyone to read. I highly recommend this book and am very grateful that I finally got around to reading it myself."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This is a masterpiece, well written, extremely well organized contemporary style book. It is often compared to The Catcher in the Rye, while I think that the angst in this book isn't so apparent.For anyone who has suffered through a mental disorder or knows someone else who has, this is a must read as it is very articulate in how it describes the process of slipping into depression."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I personally find Sylvia Plath's journals her most interesting work, but this comes in at a close second. This book will challenge just about anyone who reads it, whether you're depressed or not. If you've never been depressed in the way Esther is, you're going to ask yourself why she torments herself for no reason and perhaps feel that the storyline is implausible. the deeper you go into the book, the less sympathy you'll feel for her. If you HAVE been as depressed as Esther gets, you'll feel challenged for another reason: the book will reach TOO far into your mind and make TOO deep a connection with you because, well, Sylvia Plath describes depression very well. Her writing tends to make you feel like you and no one else are experiencing what she's going through with her, and it's pretty disturbing. However, it's also a quite rewarding experience. A &quot;bell jar&quot; is just a very apt term for a distorted view of the world that presents everything as seemingly inherently bad. Esther lives under one all the time, and she's not truly aware of it. Eventually her life is turned into a constant waking nightmare because she can't even say what's wrong with her. It's painful to read but it makes for some damn good reading. Reading this book will give you a very graphic idea of what it's like to live under a bell jar and what happens to people who live in permanent ones. You probably won't be the same after you read it."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I read this book immediately following &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot; by Susanna Kaysen. This was an interesting coincidence because both these novels are (nearly) autobiolgraphical accounts of mental traumas these women suffered in their early 20's. In fact, both women had resided in the same mental hospital during their recuperation. I finished &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot; a bit confused on how I had ever rationalized spending my time reading such a book in the first place. The author's over-personification of the trite theme of &quot;crazy may be sane&quot; wasn't even accompanied by a plot. Sadly enough, the most interesting part of the novel was the excerpt taken from a psychology textbook describing Kaysen's diagnosis. Then, I picked up &quot;The Bell Jar,&quot; not knowing what it was about, and read it. It was everything &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot; had tried to be and wasn't. The main character's experiences were real and meaningful, and the book itself tried less to shock its readers by trying to include monumental meaning, but instead, simply told its tale in a beautiful and harrowing way that perfectly reverberated the all-too-familiar struggles of a young woman emerging into an unfamiliar world that in its simpleness, conveyed more than even Kaysen could ever fathom being bestowed upon a reader."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I've been trying to broaden my reading range by throwing in a few classics here and there. One I had been interested in for quite some time is The Bell Jar. And with the Sylvia Plath movie coming out soon, I thought reading this book might be a nice complement to that. And what a real pleasure it turned out to be!The Bell Jar does not read like a classic - \\"classic\\" being the term of very old books with very old language - the description I've always had for the classic genre. This book has a very contemporary writing style, and despite it being written in the 1960s, The Bell Jar's topic of mental illness certainly transcends the generations and can be related by many people no matter when they read the book. I absolutely loved it!The Bell Jar tells the story of a young Esther Greenwood at the beginning of her mental decline. She first recognizes its oncoming during a summer of interning at a magazine company in New York City. Trying to fit in with the other interns, as well as dealing with boys and co-workers prove to be a struggle at times for Esther. And later, when the real depression and suicidal thoughts set in, readers are invited into a dark and scary world, one created realistically and with honesty by Ms. Plath.This book ranks high on my list of all-time favorites. I'm so glad I read it. From now on, if people want to read a classic (or a darn good book for that matter), I won't hesitate to suggest The Bell Jar. It's fantastic!"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Frequently, when I read about The Bell Jar, reviewers caomment on the parallels between Esther, and the author. Then they proceed to describe the book's harrowing descent into madness.I almost hate to burst the bubble, but after reading the book, I find it to be widely misinterpreted. The book is not about Esther's problems, but the problems of the world about her.When Plath wrote the book, she did so under a pseudonym. Not only, (as many suggest,) to avoid the ire of her friends, whose loosely drawn chariactures pepper this book, but also because of it's biting censure of her male oriented society. I have NO DOUBT in my mind that when Plath wrote the Bell Jar, she had no intentions of killing herself. I think the work should be viewed in that light, and when one does, it takes on a different, and far more profound meaning. Plath still needed to work in her time, so (In my opinion,) she wrote the Bell Jar to attack the restricted role of a woman in society, and she conveniently provided an out for any harsh critic, namely, that the main character is insane. To read it now, and interpret the main character as an insane, or unreliable narrator does a great disservice to what Plath intended for this work.Plath, like Esther, was perhaps the smartest woman in America during her time. She won countless scholarships, and like Esther, a guest editing slot at Mademoiselle. Now a woman of her talents would be at Harvard on a full ride, but during her day, Esther, and Plath could only hope to someday become the editor of a glamor mag, forever telling women how to tell if their lover is cheating. Not much of an existance for a bright young woman.Plath vents this frustration in the Bell Jar. Esther sees men all about her that will always be accepted, that will not be held back if they desire to become something irrational, or take on large career goals.I'm thinking specifically of the birth sequence in the middle, when Buddy and Esther watch Mrs Tomolino give birth to her child. A fat intern says that women shouldn't be allowed to watch a birth, otherwise there'd never be any children. (I am paraphrasing.) Implying their unfitness to be a doctor, (while his own obvious physical limitations are of course, ignored.) What a ridiculous notion. The men assume that Esther will not be able to stand watching the birth but she does well, noting the use of the drug. When she is told that it doesn't kill the pain, but only makes the woman forget it, Esther thinks that this is a perfect example of a man's drug. One that allows the pain to exist, but shuts it away in a dark tunnel, where someday it will rise to swallow the woman. (Again with the paraphrasing.)Other signs of this exist throughout the work. In fact, one can go as far as to say that every time her life is on track, or Esther is suceeding, the event is derailed in actuality, or symbolically, by man. (I've checked, and it is so.) The image of a bottled baby arises again and again, and Esther later states that she hates the role of mother, because of the restrictions it implies. To give in to the maternal impulse is to chain yourself to a child, to trap yourself, to become the bottled baby. Esther remarks that it is almost as if nature knew about the restrictive world of men, and it agreed, conspiring against her biologically as well.I think that perhaps the single most telling line in the book is delivered by Buddy, whom I saw as a representative of men in Esther's life. When Esther, and Buddy's earlier girlfriend both end up committed, Buddy asks if there is something about him that \\"drives women crazy. \\"If you read carefully, you'll note that Esther's doctor refutes the question, and dismisses it as a sort of casual \\"Of course not.\\" Esther simply pushes some foam from the edge of her cup back into the coffee, and says nothing. Not because she agrees with the doctor... Else she would add her comments, but because he speaks the truth, and she knows affirming this will keep her in the asylum.There is much much more that the enlightened reader may discover on his or her own, and I recommend that everyone who has read this book in their adolescent fits of suicidal fantasy, should return to the work with an eye towards its social commentary. I think you'll find the work to be stimulating, and still (sadly) relevant today. I only wish that Plath had found the strength to live though her troubles. We would still be reading her book, and revering it as a classic, but uncolored by her own experiences, the book could be freed of our society's focus on Esther's suicide attempt, and more on the conditions that created it, which definitely were NOT in her head."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Many readers seem to reject this novel because it offers no clear explanation for the psychololgical collapse it narrates. But nor, from the perspective of the afflicted, is there often any such explanation in real life. I find the way Plath unexpectedly cuts from the hilarious antics of Esther's month in New York City - told in a voice as endearing as Holden Caulfield's - into her sudden depression to be a very effective literary device. Plath doesn't explain what happens so much as she shows us what it feels like. Compare the tone of the first fifty pages to the last and you'll see this is a narrative which gradually unhinges, disintegrates, becomes less and less reliable. This is precisely what you'd expect in a first-person account of a depressive episode. Yes, it can get \\"boring and repetitive\\" as many reviewers have noted - and that's an apt representation of the lugubriousness of depression and the traditional treatments for it. There is no simple answer, no easy happy ending for Esther. She is a young person confronting the meaninglessness of life, too intelligent to fall into the easy distractions of marriage and work, but not sufficiently self-knowing to forge her own path without them. That such a path is unclear is part of the point. Hatred for this book seems to come out of a view of life (and literature) as something certain, meaningful, entertaining and closed - precisely the view which Esther, and most depressed people, cannot take. That Plath can put us in her position for a few hundred pages, and show us how puzzling and frightening it can be, is a testament to the strength of her talent."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Like millions of other young women, I'm sure, I came across \\"The Bell Jar\\" in college, and I felt an immediate attachment to the book: it uplifted me, angered me, scared me, and made me feel deeply protective, all at the same time.\\"The Bell Jar\\" tells the story of Esther Greenwood, an intelligent college student, as she slowly feels the \\"bell jar\\" of detachment and madness overtake her. As Esther goes from a prestigious internship in New York City to a summer at home with her mother in the Boston suburbs, her attachment to reality becomes more and more tenuous, until thoughts of suicide overtake her.It is no secret that the story has at least a partial basis in reality, and that Sylvia Plath is writing from her own experience is perhaps what makes Esther so deeply real. I recently wrote a review of \\"Bridget Jones' Diary,\\" and although \\"The Bell Jar\\" is undoubtedly a better book, there is a certain similarity between the protagonists: like Bridget, Esther is a character who is almost universally relatable. It does not matter if the reader is psychologically healthy or not: Esther awakens what she is feeling in all of us. My emotional response to \\"The Bell Jar\\" was on par with my emotional response to certain real-life events. I was uplifted to find a shared experience; angered at Esther's responses--and at the fact that they seemed reasonable to me; scared at the uncertainty I felt about myself and my own psychological state by the end of the book; and deeply protective--of Esther, of Sylvia Plath, and of every other reader who shared my experience.I recognize that specifically speaking of the female experience when reading \\"The Bell Jar\\" could be considered rather narrow-minded of me. I certainly believe that this book can resonate with men as well, just as \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" can resonate with women. There is something deeply female in Esther's experience, however, and I cannot put into words the extent of my appreciation that Plath was able to give a true voice to this femaleness, without getting defensive and without getting melodramatic."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Removed, unemotional, disturbing. That's Sylvia Plath's excellent book. Starting with her successes as a young adult, The Bell Jar is a fictionalized autobiography, in which she gives herself a different name. It chronicles her life through her mental breakdown, including electroshock therapy, and her fellow patients. Accuratly discribing the stresses of a girl in the 1950's, including whether to be a good little housewife or to follow her dreams. What should she choose?The book is easy to read and quick.This book, written a few years before Plath's suicide, makes subsequent accounts of insane asylums seem inconsequential, dull, and whiney.You'll never look at mental institution fiction the same again."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The fact that I have read this book at least 50 times probably makes me the most unobjective reviewer possible. Still, having read many other reviews of The Bell Jar, I am struck by the fact that most readers respond mainly to the harrowing portrayal of Esther's descent into madness rather than the wry, biting humor with which Plath describes it. Certainly, as a 19 year old college student myself, reading the novel as an easy way out of an assignment to get to know a modern American poet, I was most taken in by Plath's cynicism. Still, although cynical and satirical, this book approaches greatness because it hacks through the false outer shell of the world and divulges the ugly truth that everything means nothing...or nothing means anything, which is a great tragedy for a young, brilliant woman like Esther who has so much to look forward to. Unfortunately, she discovers that all of her hard work and success aren't going to pay off in any meaningful way. She may walk out of her psychiatrist's office in full control (at the end of the book) but one senses that the lesson she's learned, that something's wrong with everyone, will die hard. The ability to do all this with a sense of humor is amazing, not to mention that her use of simile is, perhaps, the best ever."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"As a psychologist, I believe that Sylvia Plath's novel accurately portrays the confusion and disorientation that accompany mental illness. Unfortunately, while the main character, a young college student named Ester Greenwood, rings true, the book itself is as confusing and disorienting as Ester's life. Plath's literary style seems to be to wander from scene-to-scene and present-to-past with little or no transition. The book was so disjointed that at times I looked to see if there were pages missing; how Ester goes from point A to point B is often unclear. Despite this, Ester is a real person undergoing a real struggle with a real disorder. Her thoughts of suicide are described in a simple, matter of fact manner that is extremely honest, and both the positive and negative aspects of her treatment are exposed. The book's ending, while optimistic, is overshadowed by Plath's own eventual suicide; it is the author's own experience and tragedy which makes this largely autobiographical novel a classic."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I heard about The Bell Jar from amazon.com and all the reviews seemed to be fairly well so I went out and bought it. From the very beginning I loved Esther. If you're openminded, you can connect with her on this strange level. Sometimes you want to reach out to her and tell her it will be alright. A woman with everything she has has no reason to be depressed. But that's one of my favorite things about the book. Unlike others she doesn't become depressed over a man or a lost loved one, it's just something that happens to her, and even she can't figure it out.At the beginning Esther is a brilliant young college student with great determination. However something, and there seems to be no explination for it, causes her to become depressed. Over and over she talks about &quot;being her old self again.&quot; She goes through many institutions and a few shock treatments after attempted suicide before the &quot;bell jar&quot; is lifted from her head.I love the way she describes her thoughts. I love the way she reacts to Buddy Willard and the way she stands up for herself to men unlike alot of women. I love everything about Esther, and I think you will too.Words cannot describe this book as mine seem far from it. Esther almost seems to come alive in this book."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Wheh..this was very good. It was so interesting watching Esther slowly spiral into a place she couldn't escape. I can see why this novel caused such a stir, back in the day. I can imagine that there are still some pretty oppressive schools that would FREAK if a teacher were to assign this novel...although I think it would make great high school reading. Some of Esther's stifling obstacles are not quite as true in today's world, but most are and/or have been replaced by others."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Finishing this book was the worst thing that's ever happened to me. The writing style was so clear and, for me, easy to relate to. When the story ended I grieved simply because I could not even imagine moving on to another author; but the sad truth remains, Sylvia Plath left us no other novels to cherish.To put it simply: THE BOOK IS AMAZING in that the theme is clear and sucks you into Esther's (the main character) skin. While she goes insane it almost seems as if you are going insane with her. You never hear a diagnosis or the symptoms, and her sickness is real and natural and it becomes a part of you. The things she does are never explained but all fit together into a beautiful story that could never be mimicked.Please, read this book."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This is a great book written by a powerful talented young woman that tragically committed suicide at the prime of her life. Perhaps because she was born in the wrong century, or she could not deal with society's pressures during the 1950's, and that drove her mad. Esther is concerned about being accepted in social circles, what types of behavior are proper and preoccupied with being a virgin. We can only speculate.No one torments himself or herself purposely for any apparent reason, nor do they choose to feel suicidal at times. No one really knows why, not even modern day psychiatrists. It is disturbing to call this book a \\"classic\\" (although it is) or compare it to Salinger's Holden Caufield (Catcher In The Rye is a great book too), when the Bell Jar is about a person's real pain and troubles. As a matter of fact, the not so great reviews The Bell Jar received after being published made her uneasier and more depressed, since it was compared to Salinger's work.Esther feels asphyxiated in her own world, (The Bell Jar is a metaphor for feeling emotionally stifled and trapped) and her anxiety and depression too much to handle so she attempts suicide and ends up in a mental asylum. There she receives ECT therapy (there wasn't Prozac then not that it would have been any better), which probably did not help much (just like Hemingway).The Bell Jar is of a haunting theme, and not for everyone, it is about the dark and desperate nature of a descending spiral of perplexity, ambivalence, melancholy, and ultimately death. I disagree that this piece of work is about selfishness, I love this book, and its one of my favorites."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This is an incredible book which I read during the summer, the book is about Esther, although much of it was based on the author's life. The book is set in the 1950's, when Esther was nineteen. During that time she had a metal breakdown and ended up in a mental institution. Don't let that scare you, the book is very deep and will make you feel like you're actually living everything that is going on. Sylvia Plath was a very good author, she had the gift of only writing a few words that could tell an entire story, I was able to finish it in two nights. The only ironic thing about the book was that six months after it was published, Sylvia was \\"sucked back into the Bell Jar\\" and commited suicide. This is a book like no other that will leave you thinking for a very long time."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The Bell Jar is definitely a book that I could read more than once. It's an intriguing tale of a young college-aged woman dealing with suicidal insanity and attempting to cope with society. The way Sylvia Plath tells the forlorn story of Esther Greenwood in the first person makes you enter the psychotic world of the book and makes you feel as if its your story that you're reading. She places you inside Esther's mind and you feel like you are actually there experiencing all of her incidents with Buddy Willard (her should-be lover), all of her blind dates, and all of her unbelievable loneliness that leads her to be suicidal. This book is said to be based on Sylvia Plath's own life just before she committed suicide, so that could explain the incredible vividness of depression and desolation throughout the book.The story begins with Esther in New York City working for a magazine as a summer job. She gets to know a few of her female co-workers but never truly fits in with them. She attends many banquets and parties for the magazine and has a few adventures of her own, but all this time, she refuses to let herself give in to the artificial feminine stereotype that all of the women around her fulfill. Esther begins to take notice of all of her faults and the faults of the people surrounding her. As the novel progresses, Esther's mind seems to grow more and more incoherent and she seems to be disconnected from the world.Once her summer job is over, she moves in with her mother in a suburban Boston town. For the first few days, she relaxes and observes the neighborhood from a house window while pondering about what she will do with the rest of her summer. She quickly gets bored with that and attempts to write a book but her mind just keeps getting more and more fragmented to the point where she cant sleep, read, write, or eat. This goes on for a whole week before her mother realizes what is happening to her daughter and forces her to see a psychologist. This leads Esther into intensive shock therapy and more thoughts of suicide. It is then that she realizes that she's been viewing life from a different perspective, as if surrounded by an opaque encasement... like a bell jar surrounding her.I could without a doubt relate to this book in so many ways. I shared an abundant amount of the same opinions about society as Esther did and could relate to some of the incidents. I'm pretty sure that everyone could relate to what Esther is feeling at some point in their lives.From her excursions in New York City to her terrifying shock therapy, Sylvia Plath will most definitely keep you interested in Esther's life until the very end and will leave you craving more. I recommend this book for everyone who enjoys reading about the twists and turns of the human mind."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"\\"The Bell Jar\\" introduces us to a college-aged woman who spends a month of her summer vacation in New York City, all the while working at a magazine and attending events with a group of other girls from this summer program. She is somewhat of an outsider, perpetually waiting for something more. In the novel she describes waiting for the mystery of New York City to rub off on her, but she can never seem to find it. We learn of her continual disenchantment with relationships and the potential for relationships. There is a continual feeling that she's slightly off-axis from everyone and everything else -- not in terms of any mental instability, but more that she cannot resign herself to be like the average girl her age or find herself fulfilled by anything superficial. As the novel progresses she becomes even more disconnected, as an effect of her mental degradation.It's a wonderfully well-written book, and it definitely held my interest. One of the difficult things about this novel is that it tends to over-saturate in certain age groups. And this caused me to have a somewhat distorted presumption about it prior to reading it. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't quite the \\"descent into madness\\" I was expecting. Though I've found this the case with other novels I have read as well, such as \\"Girl, Interrupted\\". The insanity doesn't quite seem so abnormal. Though that is definitely subjective. I did, however, appreciate how honest and realistic the novel is. (Granted, the protagonist obviously isn't far from the author's reach.) So while it may not have been as intense as I had hoped, it was certainly satisfying. In fact, the more I think about it after having finished it, the more satified I become with it; the way Plath crafted this book really leaves a lasting impression on you.Overall, I would certainly recommend this book. Plath has an excellent style of writing that can be very sutble, yet quickly draws you in. While I haven't read many novels dealing with this subject, I would recommend \\"The Bell Jar\\" over \\"Girl, Interrupted\\" in terms of the former's ability to really bring the reader into the mind of the \\"insane\\"."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar is one of the most moving and enlightening novels I have ever had the pleasure to read. Her honesty and patience in relating such personal (and obviousely autobiograohical) events is startling and hugely admirable.The compassion it evokes in the reader is deeply powerful but the relationship it establishes with the reader is even more powerful and it will sit on your bookshelf for decades to come like an old, reassuring friend. I thoroughly recommend this book to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"For anyone who has lived with/through clinical depression or any for of mental illness, The Bell Jar is a must read. Few authors have been successful at capturing this horrifying illness so poignantly, yet realistically. The reader is invited to experience the throngs of depression as it takes hold and tortures the individual so intensely, that for many the only way to end the emotional pain is self-destruction. Although suicide is not the answer, it exists as the one sure way to end the misery of everday existence.'How tragic that Esther is freed from her demons and Sylvia, herself, was not. This work is a masterful at exposing depression as an ugly and debilitating illness."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Lorna Lindquistbamalorna@hotmail.comLooking at what's under the glassA review of Sylvia Plath's The Bell JarWhile reading Plath can be muddied by all the \\"Plath baggage\\" that history has shown us, I think that coming to and away from this book with an open mind will help the reader enjoy it as much as I did. Plath's untimely end is not a mystery to the current reader, but to expect this book to be depressing insults the message that Plath tries to convey.The main character, Esther Greenwood, obviously suffers from a chronic depressive disorder. She constantly thinks to herself that she should be happy. She looks objectively at her sadness and explores it as though it is simply a bad habit. Greenwood comments again and again that she knows she should be excited about her fortunes in life.These fortunes mimic the fortunes that Plath herself enjoyed as a young writer. She was published early and had early success, but still her life felt blank enough for her to stick her head in the oven before she turned 30. I think that in this way, The Bell Jar is a thinly veiled autobiography. I also think that she wrote this in third person not so that her personal life could be kept hidden, but so that the examinations of depression could gain a sort of validity by being removed from the author and her stigma.One farce of depression that Plath destroys in Greenwood is the clich&eacute; that all depressed people simply lay around feeling sorry for themselves all day. In fact, Plath suggests that people who are depressed know that there is a problem with themselves, but lack the ambition to root it and solve it because even life as a whole has lost its luster.As a work, message removed, Plath's talent as a poet comes shining through. She uses phrases that so accurately describe Greenwood's situation that you feel like you can see her thoughts. She uses childish language that indicates the childish tone Plath thinks that life has to offer. She constantly says that things are \\"stupid\\" she is \\"stupid\\" others are \\"stupid.\\"Overall I think that The Bell Jar offers more to the reader than a simple story to read about what appears to be a \\"crazy girl,\\" it offers instead excellent insight made by a talented writer."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I am a 10th and 11th grade English Language Arts teacher in an urban high school setting. I purchased a class set of this book for my 11th grade classes and I was surprised by their response to it.I initially read the book in college and I was saddened by the fact that Sylvia Plath did, in fact, commit suicide. I was informed that the book, although published as fiction, is basicly a transparent account of her own breakdown during her college years. Having been made aware that Esther, the main character, is actually a flimsy representation of the author, I found the book to be captivating. I found myself examining the text closely to learn why she never \\"made it\\" after all.My students were similarly motivated. Sylvia spent some time in Winthrop, a small town neighboring East Boston, so many of the landmarks were familiar to our class. This added to the sense of \\"memoir\\" that we felt from the text.Student responses were divided. Some students related to some of Esther's problems or to Esther herself. Others found her to be a relentless whiner and high practitioner of melodrama. Everyone was shocked by the differences found in the pressures of a coming of age story set during the 50's vs the values and pressures placed on students today.At the conclusion of the book I had a guest speaker discuss suicide and depression with my students. For some of my class the book brought up issues and questions. I wanted to be sure that my kids saw a more optimistic solution to Esther's problems than Sylvia in fact did.Overall, I was given a thumbs up by my 11th grade... Although many students started to wonder \\"if she is ever going to kill herself... or what?\\" others felt decidedly anxious as the plot progressed. Many of my students liked Esther a lot and felt saddened by the obstacles that she faced during the course of The Bell Jar.

A semi-autobiographical novel about Sylvia Plath's twentieth year, it is even better if you also read her biography &quot;Bitter Fame&quot; by Anne Stevenson. The biography lets you read about that year in even more depth."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"What a wonderful insight into the mind of someone who is tortured by depression. Plath does a good job of helping you to empathize with the main character so much that it makes you wonder if you could end up in the same state, which emphasizes the insidiousness of mental illness. This book made me almost cry just because of the beautiful way she describes her pain and feelings of isolation."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Sylvia Plath , is the most realistic writer I've ever read. I know everybody loves fantasy , but sometimes, we all just want to curl up and read books that will make us feel. Like this one. She words things really well. I think this book makes people feel better for some reason. I would read it,it's g ood!"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This novel of about 200 pages consists of two quite different halves. Esther Greenwood, a brilliant college girl in the early 5Os, spends a month in New York as guest editor with a women's magazine. The first half of the novel is about her adventures with the other college girl guest editors in New York. These are extremely funny. The mood, however, is darkening constantly, so that on should not be too surprised that Esther collapses completely after the expected admittance to a writing course does not come through. The second half of the novel is about depression, suicide and psychiatric wards.The book is fascinating (although I was a bit surprised to see some reviewers rate it among the greatest novels of the century), but the narrator is not always reliable - after all, she feels she experiences life through a bell jar, cut off from the rest of the world. The book does not really help the reader understand depression the way &quot;I never promised you a rose garden&quot; by Hannah Green did for schizophrenia. We only get a very hazy notion of the nature of the therapy, for example.Maybe it is because the novel is strongly autobiographical, but the narrator always keeps a certain distance to herself. There are lots of things she would never tell. There is hardly anything she would not joke about. After all, that is what many reviewers forget to mention: &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; is a very funny book with some billiant satire on 50s America - not just in the first half!"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This book will suck you into the mind of Esther Greenwood right away.Sylvia Plath is an author with a confusing writting style yet interesting.

I know that perhaps when it was written this book had more pull, but right now the genius syndrome is just getting old. I don't mind characters with sad heads, but as long as they are presented in a new way. The way Esther is presented is &quot;oh, I'm so sad, but God I get a lot of awards and people really really like me, but oh no! and I'm the smartest person in this entire story and blah blah.&quot; Trust me, I realize that this is extremely realistic and everyone gets sad, but I just wanted a little more from the writer-something jarring.

Dang i still have 5 words left. Benedict Cumberbatch."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I probably wouldn't recommend this book to lovers of fiction. There is no \\"plot\\" as such- the story unfolds in a fly-on-the-wall manner. You're simply observing a series of events (I use this word loosely) that may or may not have any significance. Was this done on purpose? I'm sure folks will say so. But as a result, for much of the book I felt bored, wondering when something would \\"happen\\". Apparently I missed the purpose of this book until I neared the end. The book doesn't serve any purpose other than to have you tag along on a journey.I fail to see how this book became such a classic. I imagine it's much the same as those posh people in the fine art world who crowd around a painting of nonsensical splatters and \\"Ooh & Ahh\\" over its hidden meanings. I'm sure that more literary types will point out how Esther was a model of the feminist movement, the issues of mental health care, and the conservative beliefs of the time. But all these points were breezed over in passing, and failed to tweak anything inside me. There was no impact, no revelation. It seemed like whenever Plath had the opportunity to create some great moment with the reader, she shrugged and turned her back.Is this a captivating tale of real depression? To anyone who hasn't suffered from mental illness, I'm sure this book would have left them as clueless as before. Certainly it's apparent to fellow sufferers that Plath (Esther) has a big problem with mental illness. Detachment from the world, lack of consequence, suicidal thoughts in a very passive manner... these are all things I'm intimately familiar with. But this was just another thing that rubbed me the wrong way. If not to open the eyes of \\"normal\\" folk, what was the point of this book?In that sense, this book felt very self-indulgent. Plath seemed to care very little about the reader's experience. Any opportunity to expand on a concept or leave an impression on the reader was ignored. It seems that Plath simply wrote this book as a journal of sorts, but without the usual deep and personal insights.For such a personal book, Plath was remarkably successful at distancing her readers. And for that reason, I just can't recommend this book. Will there be folks who think this is a masterpiece? No doubt. I'll let them \\"Ooh & Ahh\\" over the paint splatters while I go and admire the works of the Renaissance.Edit: I should clarify that I'm perfectly aware that this was a personal work (thus the \\"lack of care about the reader's experience\\") and that it was Plath's family who published this book after her death. But given the above points, I feel that this is one of those works that should have remained private. Was this just a money making venture?"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This was a textbook requirement and though the hardcover was a plus (since I really prefer hardcovers) and the content suited the Women's Studies course I took, owning it now after the fact, gives me no resale value, as is always common as new editions emerge.

Can't remember her name, isn't that terrible? I think her character was undiagnosed bipolar. I've felt the same kind of pain in my life as hers, although I've never attempted to commit suicide. The most interesting parts of the story is when she's experimenting with different ways of killing herself. The style of writing for Sylvia Plath is very artful and descriptive. There were some slow parts in the novel and some of it was labourious to get through but overall it's an interesting story."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I purchased the 25th anniversary edition after ready an bit of the new introduction, and was really excited to read the book and didn't think that I would be left feeling disappointed.

I'd give it a passing grade of 72%. I don't regret reading it and actually found it more and more intriguing as days passed since I finished reading it.The writing style is rough. I don't want to be to critical here as it was Plath's first novel, and when I finish my first, the same may be said of mine. Sometimes the writing is brilliant, sometimes it is cumbersome, but all in all it should not affect the reader too much.Overall, not a great read, but not regrettable. A female version of Catcher In the Rye it is not, but I can see that the 20-something female reader may enjoy it more than any other demograph, identifying with Esther better. After all, we all have been there to some degree and some point in our lives. It is valuable to see how far the mental health care field has progressed since the middle of the 20th century and today.

That probably fits with the mood but jeez, that book is depressing like hell, don't expect to \\"relate\\" or feel like you're less alone or something. It's perfect like diamond as a novel, but it's just as cold too. I might be a bit harsh here, for in fact there are passages that are not this cold, of course, but the overall mood is pretty scary. It chills you. But to be honest I think I should reread it because I read it like two years ago, so what I am talking about now is the impressions it left me with. And I remember it being cold as ice. It's as though the main character is some kind of desperate machine.

While Ms. Plath goes into depth with the descent into mental illness, the reverse is not true. The protagonist's climb to mental health is not documented at all.

This compelling novel by Sylvia Plath does not only express early sparks of feminist vibes, but also leads the reader to a thorough understanding of depression and suicide.Throughout the book there are constant references to men and their importance in society. The setting is in the 1950's, but the female reader most likely knows enough about life in the 50's to relate to the setting. Many things in this book are based on gender. At about the middle of the novel, we have a prime example of this. Esther is at a maternity ward, with a \\"boyfriend\\" no less, and is told that she should not watch a birth that is going on in the room. As a female, I must say that this scene did indeed make me cringe; but why should it be made a general assumption that all women would? Also during this scene, Esther is shown the dead fetuses that have been kept for observation. This is yet again- not something that she is asked to see, yet also not something that bothers her. As said throughout the novel- Esther herself would not be happy as a wife, let alone a mother. I was given the impression that she looked at being a mother and a wife as being a slave. \\"This seemed dreary and wasted life for a girl for a girl with fifteen years of straight A's, but I knew that's what marriage was like, because cook and clean and wash was just what Buddy Willard's mother did from morning till night, and she was the wife of a university professor and had been a private school teacher herself.\\" Esther was trapped under the bell jar- locked away from all else in the world...why would she want to increase this distant feeling?There is a portion of this book that I felt to be very symbolic that no other reviews have seemed to touch upon- that being the metaphor about the fig tree. Sylvia stated that \\"From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and wrinkled.\\" All of these figs were different routes in her life that she could take- a plethora of opportunities before her that began to tear her apart. Yet again- there is references to the trapping of her soul inside of her own brain and thoughts. Inside the bell jar. As the denouement approaches, Sylvia's character of Esther is sent to an asylum for a depressive mental breakdown that has been foreshadowed to the reader through out the book. Here she remains in a world that is new to her- a world of electroshock therapy, various asylums, and an increased state of self-dissatisfaction. This book took the reader on a real life journey through the life of novelist/poet Sylvia Plath- from her odd obsession with the Rosenbergs, to the last lines of her 'note on the book' \\"to the person in the Bell Jar, blank and stopped as a dead baby, the world it self is a bad dream.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This is a work of art. It is Sylvia Plath's scarcely disguised autobiography, the painful story of how she attempted suicide and how she was &quot;stuck together with glue&quot; as I've once heard it put.

It is a brilliant and thought-provoking work."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I read this book after hearing it mentioned in a movie and not having any idea what it was about.

The reason is, we have all at one time in our life felt like we were trapped, and plath's sutle genius shines through this book. It has an almost naive quality about it. The main character of Esther is like the voice inside all of our heads. i doubt very much that books such as Prozac Nation would have ever been printed if Plath hadn't done it first."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The Bell Jar is one of those books that stays with you forever. Although teresa is right when she says this is an excellent book, she is wrong about one thing. Esther, the main character, has a lot more going on in her head than teresa let's on. I won't give the plot away, but at the end of the book, the reader walks away still disturbed. She knows that Esther isnt better, and probably will never be.

The most obvious is &quot;Esther's&quot; honesty, she almost embraces and encourages her psychosis, instead of running away from the harsh reality of life. I highly recommend this book, it marked a cataclysm in my literary life. It surely will change any other young woman's life.

Esther goes through mental breakdowns and Sylvia Plath makes sure you know every detail. She bases this book on her rel life experiences and everything she goes through. This is an emotional story that will pull you in and make you not want to put your book down.Author Bio: Sylvia Plath was born in Boston on October 27th, 1932. She attended Smith College on a scholarship, and in 1952 won a Mademoiselle short story contest, which allowed her to work as a guest editor in New York. When she came back she tried committing suicide and ending up in an institution for a while. After she got out of the institution, she went to finish college at Smith and then went to Cambridge after that. She ended up meeting a poet named Ted Hughes. They ended up moving to the United States. She wrote her first book of poetry called The Colossus and Other Poems in 1960. Shortly after in 1963 she published The Bell Jar and a month later committed suicide.Evaluation: This book is a very good book and I would recommend it to any young teen and older. Sylvia Plath had made this story relating to real life experiences and to be able to read about it is very interesting. My friend had been reading it and it sounded good so I picked it up and couldn't put it down. It started off a little slow but ended up being interesting for the rest of the story."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Read it through in less than a few days and could not, would not put it down. The Bell Jar allowed me to see into the depth of the character's feelings and mind. Well written and wonderfully deep. Her gift of talent to the reader haunts."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This book is a work of art. Plath's poetic skill comes shining through in this novel about a young woman suffering from severe depression and suicidal ideation. Plath's use of words to convey images, feelings, thoughts and personality is precise. The story flows beautifully, as she tells the story of Esther Greenwood.Esther's fall into depression reveals in depth insights into the malady that come from Plath's own experiences. This brings up an issue when reading this book. It is difficult to separate the character and the novel from the author and her own life and tragic ending. That consistently loomed in the back of my mind as I read about E. Greenwood.I enjoyed reading this, but also had to put it down at times because of the depressing nature of the story. Plath puts the reader into the thoughts and consciousness of a depressed young woman, and that is not an uplifting experience. I don't think this is the type of novel you just read for pleasure w/o becoming involved with the character. Plath wants to make sure you know what it is like to be a depressed person thinking about suicide.It has an optimistic ending that allows you to leave Esther Greenwood to take on the world again and to trust that she will do OK, even though the author fell victim to the depression that haunted her."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"While reading something, somewhere, I saw this book mentioned, and I ordered it from the library.

I first came upon this book when introduced to it by my English teacher quite a few years ago. It's a raw look at the mental stability of Plath before her marriage to Ted Hughes.

Everyone can relate to something about the main character Esther; whether you are male or female."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This book is a classic by any standard or categorization, and certainly stands out in the genre of mental illness narratives. It is probably one of the most vivid and articulate descriptions of mental illness ever written. Not surprisingly, I also found it disturbing and somewhat frightening.

When reading, you can almost hear the whispers of depression and anguish in between the typing on the page. I found the book extremely interesting and yearning to wonder how someone so talented (see also E. Wurtzel) could feel so horribly bad just livign out life. The book is a pre-cursor to the many books on depression out today, but offers its knowledge through a story of fiction and undoubtedly, of the happenings of the well-known author."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This book is amazing. Plath includes her personal feelings and emotions. She draws you into the mind and soul of Esther Greenwood. Although it is has a dark tone, the novel draws you in. This book is not for everyone though. If you like happy and light hearted novels, this is not for you. This is a great book if you are looking to read something \\"deep.\\" There are many psychological and social issues that are presented through out the text. The use of symbolism proves to be effective, as well. Overall, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is not afraid of the idea of death (heaven knows that there is much about that through out the book)."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I recommend this book. It is rightly considered mandatory reading in our schools.

The Bell Jar is a short, yet jarring story of a young English major descending into mental illness. Plath sets a dark, forlorn, tone from the very first page. Plath had this remarkable gift for language that creates a haunting portrait of a girl losing her mind. Plath's Bell Jar is like a ghostly shadow that seizes the reader around the shoulders and refuses to let go until page 244. The Bell Jar is one of those unique books that stays with the reader psychologically long after the last page is read."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"\\"It was a queer and sultry summer, the summer they electrocuted the Rosenbergs.......that's all there was to read about in the papers--goggle eyed headlines staring up at me from every street corner. I couldn't help wondering what it would be like being burned alive all along your nerves.\\"And so begins this novel, documenting the life of one young Esther Greenwood as she starts off working as an intern at one of NYC's more prestigious magazine firms, and ends up in the nuthouse.The way Esther documents (she and a friend) getting picked up by some DJ on the street in NYC is hilarious, but this, unfortunately, is perhaps the last bright spot in the book and we have barely turned the cover. The book then takes us on a manic roller coaster journey in and out of mental institutions that would come to be synonymous with Plath's life, on which this novel is based. The rest, alas, is history.But Esther, or Sylvia Plath, was not simply crazy. She was highly rational, in my mind anyhow. Knowing how much to tip, however, was one thing that caused the young Esther much consternation. She documents getting stalked by a taxi driver after exiting the cab after not having left a substantial enough gratuity. And as for her reflections on room service, this is what she writes: \\"I could have called down and asked for breakfast in my room, I guess, but I would have to tip the person who brought it and I never know how much to tip. I'd had some very unsettling experiences trying to tip people in New York.\\"Critics call this book self-absorbed, but we are all self-absorbed in our own ways, are we not? I see Ms. Plath, or the young Esther Greenwood, as a sensitive woman who was simply overwhelmed by the contradictions, intricacies, cruelties and vagaries of life. And, of course, there may have been, and probably was, a chemical imbalance somewhere in that mind of hers. Those less sensitive of us would simply call her a \\"paranoid nutcase,\\" but as one person noted, \\"Sylvia Plath had a way with darkness..........\\" She sure did.Read this book at the risk of getting severely depressed but at the same time learning that you aren't crazy--you are simply a lone fish in a crazy world.Rick gives it four stars.

Why did I wait so long? Well, you know the saying, so many books, so little time. Sylvia Plath's prose, plotting, character development, and sheer brilliance left me riveted.

I got very into Plath and her poetry shortly thereafter. The love and respect that I have for Plath is not easy to put into words. I ended up studying her extensively in Grad School and writing my thesis on The Bell Jar. After reading feminist criticism by Julia Kristevia who studied Jacques Lacan, I knew I had to base my thesis on this. My argument was that Plath used feminine language in her novel that was in direct opposition with the 50s stereotypes that she was being forced into. The only way for Ester Greenwood to back to what she felt was true was to descend into \\"madness\\" which was not madness at all but a way to cope with the life she was being FORCED to lead by those around her. Ester was able to overcome her demons by basically rejecting the \\"masculine or symbolic\\" language and embracing the semiotic or feminine language that Kristevia described. Plath rocks!"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I read this book a few months back and really enjoyed it.

I absolutely loved it then, and it really holds up as a classic. Yes, it's a feminist novel, and yes, it's angsty, but it's also well-written, moving, and realistic. Plath was one of a kind, and the world is just a little colder without her in it."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"It is good to read about people who are talented, intelligent, perfectionists who suffer from a mental disorder- why - because I think it takes the discrimination out of mental illness that we all have. We are all mentally ill to some degree so I don't know why we abhor it. Maybe with people like Sylvia Plath, we can learn to be more compassionate to one another or ourselves, realizing how easily one can fall into depression or any other type of ailment that attacks our mind."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Insanity is a weird thing - most people are \`insane' to some degree or the other - while a minority succumb to the polarities of the disease and swing back and forth much like a pendulum.Sylvia Plath fell into the latter category, and while the positive end of her spectrum meant that she created some shockingly good work, the negative end ensured that she would meet a tragic and self-inflicted end. Her suicide I think, remains the most mechanical, yet most poetic death of all the great writers, and it's a pity that shes often remembered as \`that woman poet who stuck her head in an oven' when in fact she was well spoken, eloquent woman whose command over the English language was much vaster and encompassing than yours or mine.\\"The Bell Jar\\", her only full length fictional prose work, is almost autobiographical in patches. The publishers make it clear that this is not Plaths' own story, but you cannot help but identify the lead character as Plath herself. The way I see it is this - Sylvia created a fictional character, but gave it her mind and thoughts, leading to one of the most fascinating fictional characters in modern prose. To me, this was the literary equivalent of a convergence of both David Lynch's masterpieces \\"Inland Empire\\" and \\"Mulholland Drive\\". The same \\"a woman in trouble, yet she doesn't know it yet\\" theme permeates the entire novel, and by the time it reaches its (somewhat obvious) conclusion, you're left wondering how Plath didn't invest more of her time in churning out full fledged prose novels.Simply put, this novel chronicles the descent of a womans' mind, but its so much more than that. It speaks of mental disease with a frankness that the author probably didn't quite comprehend at the time. Maybe she did, but either way, I think what she was doing her was to capture the state of her own mind frame by frame until that fateful day in real life when she so notoriously took her own life. \\"The Bell Jar\\" has its moment of adolescent wandering and naivete, which I found quite endearing considering the age of the author when she wrote this. Perhaps she wasn't mature enough to deal with life as she grew older, or maybe she was too caught up in her own web of literary wonder to crawl out of it. I think all the great poets were afflicted to some degree with this disease, and Plath is no exception.If you're interested in a semi-autobiographical (though the blurb won't admit it!) book by a great poet, this is the book for you. Its never boring, and is quite an easy read as Sylvia trades in her famous double entendre poetic metaphors for more easily accessible and simply written language. Short crisp sentences. Clear dialogue. And yet, the sentences get shorter, and thoughts get more fragmented as we plummet with the author into the very depths of insanity. An unforgettable, and somewhat scary experience - but as a book lover, one you should definitely experience.Five Stars."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I wouldn't consider myself an expert in literature, although I am a bit of a writer myself, I find the bell jar to be an excellent and honest modern novel. An autobiography of sorts, the Bell Jar reports a particularly bad time of transition in Plath's life. For anyone else, being an honor student on scholarship and given the chance to be an intern at a fashion magazine in New York would be an amazing experience. But she is unimpressed and seems disenchanted by the whole thing. She has no idea what she should do with her life. She hates the thought of being tied down to one profession when there are so many to choose from. Things get worse when the internship is over and she moves back in with her mother. She cannot sleep and no longer desires food. Taken to a doctor for her insomnia, she is referred to a shady psychiatrist who subject her to crude shock treatments. Things only get worse and she becomes suicidal, always seeking out a new method of knocking herself off. She almost succeeds at one point and is taken to an asylum where she begins the process of rebuilding herself. This book remains a very honest look into the mind of troubled young girl. Interestingly, Plath never really gives a reason why she feels the way she does in the book, she just seems to be spiraling into madness with no more knowledge of the reason than the reader possesses."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar is a window into the psyche of a mentally unstable woman in the 1950s; it shows an interesting point of view of being in a mental institution. There are not many books that are about or have this perspective of a mentally unstable person losing their mind for the first time and going to a mental institution. There aren't many good books about that, at least. I found that this book was incredibly hard to put down, it keeps you on the edge of your seat a lot, I found myself reading for hours without even realizing it. It is written so well and seems like something a lot of people, myself included, can relate to on several different levels. The way she describes what is going on and what is happening to her it almost seems logical. We can see it from her point of view, the way she thinks and goes about doing everything. It is like a window into her brain, the reader can see what is going on inside her head and the logic behind things she does.One thing that really interested me was the constant referral to a bell jar, like the title, which symbolizes her madness. It is so intriguing the way she describes it as her being inside a bell jar that drops on her, distorting her perception on the world. And then towards the end when it is lifted off of her but still hovers, she knows she is not well but is getting better. It left me wondering what would happen to her next, when the bell jar will fall on her again and what will happen next time it does."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Identifiable darkness is what best describes the tone of The Bell Jar, by Sylvia Plath. Opening this book there is an expectation of simplicity but knowing Sylvia Plath's history one knows it can't only be that. The book follows a seemingly average girl through the twists and turns of her life through good and luck filled times and on to scary and dark times.As one delves into the story line expectations are quickly contradicted as the main character, Esther, begins to wallow in deep depression and her life begins to change dramatically once she visits a psychiatrist. Plath hooks the reader by making Esther so easy to identify with, almost making the reader feel as if there is something wrong with them like there is with Esther. Her thoughts are not abnormal, they are thoughts that everyone thinks about but the extent to which Esther dramatizes these thoughts sends her deeper and deeper into her own world of confusion and the unknown.Different characters enter and leave Esther's life throughout the novel and they each affect her in different ways but they all are instigators in her loss of touch with reality. Buddy Willard, a boy who Esther has dated and who likes her very much, seems to be a key player in her initial downfall. She had always looked up to him but her sudden thoughts of no longer being attracted to him confuse her and anger her and he eventually fades out of her life, as all the others have before him and will after him. There is not one character who stays constant in Esther's life, not even her mother and Plath uses this situational device to further exemplify Esther's aloneness in the world and her ongoing journey down the road of depression.Plath uses symbolism, and the power of narration by the main character to bring out the complexities going on in Esther's life and mind. An example of the symbolism is the fig tree that Esther talks about as representing her unknown future. \\"One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor,...and beyond these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out\\"(Plath 77). The symbolism amplifies Esther's fear of the unknown and her confusion in what path to take out of the endless possibilities that lay ahead of her. \\"I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose\\" (Plath 77). This shows Esther's fear of her future leading to her dark depression. The reader feels like they know Esther better than anyone else in the world because they are living through her, through her dark, cynical, tone and uneasy state. This quality makes the book more intriguing and much harder to put down. Though its not a suspense novel, one still wants to keep going from chapter to chapter to better understand what Esther is going through and in hopes of seeing her lifted up from the hole she has dug herself."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"It's a great book for sure, one of the best books I've read from this century. However, I've noticed that many say this book goes into a \\"dark scary place\\" or something similar. I did not see it that way at all. You follow the course of Esther Greenwood's thoughts, and though she does get depressed, I never found the book to be dark or in a morbid mood. It always seemed somehow cynical and lighthearted to me.maybe spoilers following..it even has a happy ending. Plath's life did not, though."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I expected this novel to be incredibly depressing and so had put off reading it, but I was pleasantly surprised to find how much humor it actually has. Futhermore, the writing style is crisp and concise, making it a very easy read. An interesting thing about this novel is it's incredible subtlety.While often being quite descriptive regarding events and people, the protagonist actually shares very little information about her personal thoughts and her rationalizations for her actions. Normally I would see that as a flaw but the events she narrates seem to actually speak for themselves so that we can almost guess how she must have been feeling or why she was so upset as a woman in a restrictive society who encountered several difficult relationships with men. We can see that these relationships upset her and that the social norms she imbibed growing up kept her from feeling free to express herself, leading to mental instability. This allows the reader to become more involved than is generally possible by encouraging them to fill in the blanks and analyze what is happening in order to draw conclusions about her feelings for themselves.While often interpreted as being feminist, anyone can read into the novel their own interpretations of her psychological demise based on their own experiences. For example, her type A personality and the pressure she puts on herself as an over achiever is another probable trigger for mental breakdown. Though slightly ambiguous as to the source of her depression, the symptoms of alienation and withdrawal are clearly mapped out. Even if you are unable to relate to what appears to be a self-centered, passive, depressive the symptoms are accurate and the the detached tone is an appropriate reflection of someone who is depressed since it makes sharing your feelings with the people around you so difficult. Even the choppy narration can be seen to reflect the mental instability.The lack of a fast paced plot or some kind of racy trigger for her depression highlights the fact thay anyone can become depressed seemingly without warning, and that the ordinary day to day trials of life can be just as wearing on the soul as an dramatic encounter. The overall feeling of the book is one of alienation and withdrawal from the world, yet with delightful touches of humor, written in a simple and straighforward, yet poetic manner."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"\\"The Bell Jar\\" isn't a book that I would have selected for myself under normal circumstances. Thus I feel it's appropriate to give the reason for my reading the book as a bit of a premise for my review. My favorite musician, Ryan Adams has a hauntingly beautiful song titled \\"Sylvia Plath.\\" The song itself tells of a fascinating woman, and clearly her writing and her life touched Adams in such a profound way that he wrote a tune for her. It was because of that, that I decided to see what the fuss was about, which brings us to my review.I did no research on \\"The Bell Jar\\" prior to buying the book, so I had zero idea what I was in store for. What I found over the past week of reading the book was a thoroughly readable and realistic, feasible story of a tortured, pain filled soul. The writing style of Plath is beautiful throughout, and what strikes me is how current Esther and her situations seem today. I felt at the end of the novel as if the book could have been released this past week, it's that true to life. Now, being a man roughly the same age as Esther it was interesting to read a story which seemed autobiographical throughout from the perspective of a woman. Esther is so much like many people I've met, and she faces the same turmoil that many young people today still face.While the content was indeed heavy and deep and often times a struggle to read as a result--suicide is never a fun topic, and I unfortunately witnessed a dear friend's suicide while living in Spain many years ago--it's a very real problem for young people who don't feel there are alternatives to the bad hands they were dealt.I could not sleep at night if I were to offer any fewer than 5 stars to this book. So easy to read from the perspective of style, and so hauntingly real, I understand fully well why now after having read the book myself I see so many others ranting and raving, singing its praises.\\"I wish I had a Sylvia PlathBusted tooth and a smileAnd cigarette ashes in her drinkThe kind that goes out and then sleeps for a weekThe kind that goes out on herTo give me a reason, for well, I dunno\\"~Ryan Adams"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"While \\"The Bell Jar\\" has appeared on high school reading lists for quite a long time, I don't know many teachers who have actually made it a part of their curriculum. Perhaps they see it as a book for adolescent girls and thus unlikely to appeal to teenage boys? That's a shame. It's beautifully written and, to my mind, it stands the test of time, unlikely, say, other golden oldies like the moribund \\"A Separate Peace\\" or even \\"A Catcher in the Rye.\\"The boy problem is easily solved, since this novel, a thinly disguised memoir set in the fifties, has its perfect opposite number in a fifties \\"boy\\" memoir: \\"This Boy's Life\\" by Tobias Woolf. Both books raise the interesting question: how has life changed for teenagers since the fifties and how has it remained the same? Taught together, they would illuminate for both genders the process that's usually referred to as \\"coming of age\\" but, as regards these two books, might better be described as the process of beginning to see the world as an inexperienced (and also fascinated) adult. This sort of perspective would most appeal to high school juniors and seniors. Although \\"Catcher\\" is a standard in freshman curricula, the sexual episodes in the Plath and Woolf make them best for older students.M.

Some parts were a bit slow, but overall it was very good, and the ending was great."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The poet in Sylvia Plath emerged in the entire course of the novel. Her descriptions are nothing short of beautiful, and the life of Esther Greenwood plays before your mind's eye like a motion picture. The opening image of New York city is so vivid you can practically feel the heat of summer in the city: \\"Mirage-gray at the bottom of their granite canyons, the hot streets wavered in the sun, the car tops sizzled and glittered, and the dry, cindery dust blew into my eyes and down my throat\\". I love it. The words ebb and flow and just create.It is tough following a woman down into her depression. She has this great life working as an intern for a fashion magazine in the heart of New York City, and then, she just doesn't care anymore. Her life whirls around her and it's as if she just wants to get off the ride. And the voice is very conversational, very informal. I could relate to the character; even though I'm not depressed myself, I felt sympathy and friendship with Esther. If I had known her, I would have visited her in the asylum.Anyway, it's a good book, thought-provoking, creative, a bit morbid, but well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"\\"The silence depressed me. It wasn't the silence of silence. It was my own silence.\\"So, I missed the boat on this one, back in high school when every literate fifteen year old girl was reading it. I'm glad I waited out. I think I would have liked it, but perhaps for the wrong reasons.Ok. The book morbidly fascinates me--a thinly veiled autobiograhical novel of a poet's descent into madness written by a woman who later stuck her head in an oven and committed suicide. Just from this knowledge, the book becomes immediately haunting. But it's not just this black curiosity that made this an engaging read. I love how absolutely honest it is. Unlike other books I have read in which the protagonist goes \\"crazy,\\" Esther Greenwood's insanity is subtle and far more realistic. At the beginning of the book, Esther seems relatively put together, but she slowly unravels so fluidly that I surprised myself when I realized, \\"Wow. This girl is really crazy.\\" Perhaps because it is based on personal experience, I think that Plath's depiction of depression is so well-done. She shows that it is not a raging force, but rather a paralysis, a lack of emotion--and all through beautiful and intense language.This book is a good read, but it will depress you. That being said, I would recommend it, especially to girls in college who feel like they can relate to Plath's story."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"In one of its first reviews, in 1963, this book was called \\"the first feminine novel in a Salinger mood.\\" The narrator certainly has that unique outsider's perspective on a world of which she appears to be part--so typical of Salinger's work. While Esther Greenwood has the outward trappings of a successful college student, she is in reality merely acting the role expected of her by society, increasingly unable to see the point.The powerful thing about this novel is that, despite her impending breakdown, it is easy to understand and identify with so much of Esther's thinking. Her despair is initially rooted in a concern quite common to young adults--but brilliantly expressed--that the myriad *felt* possibilities of life can never be realized in a structured (and stifling) world:\\"I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked.... I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.\\"Unfortunately, Esther's despair continues to deepen, as even the most successful futures begin to seem empty, all effort towards them pointless. In the end, even daily life becomes devoid of meaning:\\"I saw the days of the year stretching ahead like a series of bright, white boxes, and separating one box from another was sleep, like a black shade. Only for me, the long perspective of shades that set off one box from the next day had suddenly snapped up, and I could see day after day after day glaring ahead of me like a white, broad, infinitely desolate avenue.\\"While this transition accompanies a real psychological illness, we experience it through Esther's own thoughts. As a result, the progression of anguish seems natural, consistent, and even sensible. For this, the book has been justly praised for its insight into the inner workings of a troubled mind.In summary, I enjoyed both the beauty of the prose as well as the unique narrative perspective, which offers a troubling but fascinating glimpse of mental disorder. Throughout, sprinklings of humor, intelligent feminist thought, and echoes of Sylvia Plath's own life keep the novel engaging as well as entertaining. (I recommend this edition, which contained just enough background material on Plath and the book's publication to put the work in proper context)."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Esther Greenwood, a college student from Massachusetts wins a dream assignment, with eleven other students, on a big New York fashion magazine. Esther is vulnerable and impressionable and is unable to enjoy her assignment; some of her experiences frighten and disorient her. Esther does not fit in with either of her friends: the rebellious Doreen or the conformist Betsy.Returning home, Esther finds that she has not been accepted into a writing course she applied for, and this leads her to consider what choices she has in life. Thus begins a descent into depression, and a very personal form of madness.It is easy to see autobiographical parallels with Sylvia Plath's own life. Perhaps too easy, and this can detract from a broader message of identity and belonging, which so many of us experience and can relate to. I first read part of this novel as a teenager, almost 40 years ago. I read it then as an autobiographical novel which, while it raised many of the questions I was considering myself, had no comfortable answers. Coming back to the novel now, I see that I wasn't looking past the tragedy of Sylvia Plath's own death to appreciate the writing for its own sake. While Ms Plath took her own life at age 30, that this was a (tragic) choice, not an inevitable outcome.So, why read this novel now? It was published almost 50 years ago and while aspects of the setting reflect that, the underlying search for identity and purpose are timeless.

Sylvia Plath is clearly more famous for poetry than prose, but this novel, written first person, is able to subtly place the reader squarely in the protagonist's shoes. The passage \\"the air of the bell jar wadded around me and I couldn't stir\\" illustrates the tactile feeling Plath's writing convey's and the sympathy it engenders in the reader.

The novel is semi-autobiographical and includes Plath's harrowing experience with an attempt at suicide.The story begins with Esther and eleven other girls in a New York city hotel room, all winners of an internship from a fashion magazine contest. It follows her through a variety of adventures as she slowly sinks deeper and deeper into depression. The slow demise of Esther's mind is shown and explained in her attempt at suicide to her experiences in a rehabilitation center and is made to seem almost, but not completely rational and understandable to the reader.&quot;The Bell Jar&quot; is a compelling and engrossing book that will keep the readers eyes glued to the page until the abrupt ending."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was 15 years old. I thought it was mere happenstance that I encountered it, and every since that first introduction it has stayed on my mind every since.Sylvia Plath was one of the most interesting writers of our time. She wrote what she felt and rarely has there ever been another like her or will there ever be.I feel that the mere emphasis on depression in her book was indeed a wake up call for many during that time. During the 1950's people did not readily express their emotions, basically what wasn't socially acceptable was generally locked up inside. It was no accident that Plath chose to write about her own neurotic feelings from the perspective of someone on the outside looking in.I clearly believe that Plath was desperately relaying her feelings in terms of the constant hopelessness and utter betrayal that she possibly felt as a brilliant,young, white woman during the 1950's who was relatively endowed with all the possibilities that one could ever hope for but still utterly depressed, lonely, and confused.This book gives wonderful insight for those who are depressed,lonely, and confused. Plath actually comes to a sort of numbness when she realizes that the planning and hoping as it might be to be the best is not all that it is cracked up to be.This book is brilliant, and unfortunately Plath committed suicide during her short life and career. Sometimes, I ponder about what could have been if she had lived just a little bit longer. We all face times in which we are unsure but we must strive to continue on.&quot;The Bell Jar&quot; was and will always be one of the best books that I have ever read.

One of the reasons Plath was such a genius was her command of the English language. &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; does not read like a novel, but more like prose, which made the book a quick read.&quot;The Bell Jar&quot; tells the story of Ester Greenwood, a young woman interning at a woman's magazine in New York City. The reader fully witnesses Ester's decent into depression and her institutionalization in a mental hospital. Like her poetry, &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; is semi - autobiographical and very emotional. Plath also leaves the ending of the novel ambiguous, I do not want to give the ending away but I will say this, do not expect any sort of resolution.All in all, I would recommend this book to Plath fans and those who appreciate a clever, wonderfully written piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The Bell Jar has been on my &quot;to read&quot; list for years, now I finally know what all the fuss is about. This matter-of-fact story about a young woman's descent into the depths of depression is nothing short of brilliant. I watched a close friend suffer for years with the demon of clinical depression, and always wondered why someone with so much going for them would fall prey. The answer I now know after reading this novel is that there is no answer, it just happens. Although I believe that someone who does not suffer from depression can never fully understand what it feels like, reading The Bell Jar will likely take you as close as you can bear to come."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"When I was sophomore in college, a classmate was a nice, articulate, bright, and beautiful young woman, whocommited a suicide few months later. I always wonderedwhat would drive a privileged young person, with suchbright prospects, to kill him/herself. Ms. Plath'sbook finally gave me a startlingly and shockingly clearportrait of the gradual spiral of despair that culminatesin the ultimate act of self-destruction. Such mentalillness strikes across all social, econmic, racial, andreligiouls boundaries, but rarely has any author beenso candid and courageous in chronicling his/her ownhumiliating and agonizing experiences. It's worth notingthat Ms. Plath died by suicide at the age of 31.I cannot give it five stars, which is reserved for thelikes of Edith Wharton's \\"Age of Innocence\\", but it'sa gripping and harrowing must-read for anyone who everwondered about the experience of mental illness."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The Bell Jar is a terrifying account superbly crafted. Plath had a cool, pungent, almost hair raising writing style, deceptively simple and fluid, plus a marvelously wry sense of humor."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Plath followed the great tradition of J.D Salinger when she wrote this book. The book almost tells of Plath's own insanity. In this book you hear her characters veiws on life/love/sex/and the world. It also gives an intreasting look at people with mental illness. I had an easy time relating to the main character and the way she feels towrads the world. I think this book is especialy great for teens but you cannot exclude adults,this book will touch anyone of any age in some way.It's just sad Plath never wrote any other novels."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"From the moment I picked up this book and started to read it I could not put it down. I was not very well informed about Sylvia Plath, the poet, when I began reading this autobiographical, but as I dove deeper into her world of reoccuring madness I could understand what she was going through as a gifted young writer. Even if you are not a lover of poetry you will still enjoy this well written piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Annotation: The Bell Jar details the life of Esther Greenwood, who is very successful, intelligent, and beautiful. For no explained reason, Esther begins to go crazy. Sylvia Plath takes you into Esther's mind, and you slowly fall into her insanity right along with her. You will experience a cynical yet reasonable outlook on life.Author Bio: Sylvia Plath was born in 1932. She was raised in a middle-class home, and attended Smith College. During her junior year in college, she suffered a mental breakdown. This is chronicled in The Bell Jar, which is largely autobiographical. She recovered well enough to finish her senior year, receiving various awards and graduating summa cum laude. She won a Fulbright scholarship and went to Cambridge University for two years. There, she met Ted Hughes, a British poet whom she married and moved to England with. With him, she had two children. She committed suicide at age 30, and her macabre poetry was collected afterwards in three books.Evaluation: The reason I bought this book was because the name sounded familiar, and the back told me that I would be following the crack-up of Esther Greenwood. It sounded interesting, but little did I know just how closely I would witness Esther's insanity! What really stands out in my mind about The Bell Jar is how immersed I was in Esther's world, thoughts, and feelings. I felt like I was right there with her, and I could almost feel her emotions. At many points, I had to stop reading because I was beginning to feel as depressed as she was! Sylvia Plath does an excellent job of bringing the reader into Esther's mind. Her cynical views seemed very normal and feasible. Ideas and phrases are well articulated, so you can understand exactly what Sylvia/Esther is talking about. Plath's thoughts are very well expressed. It's incredibly interesting to read about somebody who is going insane, especially since the story is largely autobiographical - so you know that Esther's outlook on life and her downward spiral were actually experienced by Sylvia Plath. I love how nothing in the book is sugarcoated. It's great to read something that has the ability to take you from your normal, healthy mind into the psychology of someone going crazy. Finally, I loved the metaphor about the bell jar, from which the book got its title. So while the story can be depressing and a bit much at times, it's very well worth it in the end. To sum it up, this book is extremely interesting, realistic, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good read that's a little bit out of the ordinary."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"&quot;There are no crazy people, merely crazy situations.&quot;Now, I don't necessarily agree with this quotation. I think that there are in fact, plenty of crazy people out there, many of whom think themselves quite sane.This book has been described as the story of one woman's descent into madness. And I cannot see it as such. In the narrator's case, I think she clearly and unflinchingly reports the happenings of the world around her. And her inability to accept the people and standards that her society deems 'normal' as such makes her feel extremely disconnected.I had been warned when I was younger that I shouldn't read this book as it was depressing, sad, bleak, etc. I finally devoured it for the first time last month and loved it. YEs, the tale is sad, but I found it strangely uplifting that she had such a clear, 'modern' view of the situation in which she found herself. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"A Catcher in the Rye for girls, the Bell Jar is as fresh and exciting as it was when first published forty years ago - it really is essential reading.On the surface, this thinly-disguised autobiographical novel about wide-eyed young college student Esther Greenwood's experiences working in a summer job at a top New York magazine office appears to be a light, humorous read; but the hidden depths soon crack open as the story spirals disturbingly downwards into the black depression of Esther's breakdown, failed suicide attempt and subsequent psychiatric treatment. You only have to read the stunning Journals of Sylvia Plath to see how much this novel mirror's the author's own tragic life story.Sylvia Plath is best known as a poet, and reading the beautiful narrative prose of this novel you can see why ... the words sing off the page! The Journals tell us what a talented and prolific writer Sylvia Plath was during her short lifetime, and The Bell Jar shows us what a major novelist she would have become if she had lived longer."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar is an outstanding novel. I could not rate this book for anything less than five stars. In Plath's personal life, she suffered with a mental breakdown and later committed suicide. Sadly, because of her trouble, she was able to write a very detailed story.I could actually feel exactly what the character, Esther Greenwood, felt. I was taken through each emotion, from happiness to sadness, during the process of Esther's mental breakdown. It was interesting to see through the eyes of the very disturbed girl. At times I found myself relating to Esther, but at other times I would think of how extremely nutty she was.The Bell Jar was so well written, with a certain flow, that I could not put it down. I was dissapointed to find myself at an end. I most certainly recommend The Bell Jar, as I already have to many."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I cannot begin to tell you how striking this book is; its words are full of poetry and exquisite descriptions. Its narrative is vivid and outstanding and its intensity is extraordinary.Esther is perturbed, she is a loner in a world of multiple possibilities; she has so much to choose from that she begins her descent into a world of darkness known only to those who are really desperate, to those who have the tendency of breaking with reality to those who experience a deep breakdown.The power of this material is astounding and the attention to imagery and rhetoric is ruthless.I recommend it and give it 10 stars. Unforgettable."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The Bell Jar is the best book I have ever read. The book shows a great sense of feminism and feelings against men. The book explains very clearly the feelings that Plath has gone through. The scenes of suicide are powerful, and makes one look at why someone would desire to take their life. The book takes a look at depression, on a slightly darker scale. Parts of the book are so deep, that it draws the reader's emotions into the life of Esther, the main character of the book.Esther suffers depression, even though in the beginning of the book, she has almost every girls dream, to be living in New York City, for one month free, after winning a contest. The book takes a look at the darker moments in Esther's life, revealing her innermost thoughts, fears, and emotions. Plath's writing is able to make the reader break down along with Esther, and her many faultering emotions. Most women will be able to relate with the ever changing emotions and easy annoyance that Esther goes through. Feeelings of lonlyness, rage, anger, jelousy, anxiety and distress have a great hold throughout the book."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Like other poets and writers, Sylvia Plath got her acclaim after her death, in her case, suicide. Suicide always helps to enhance a person's worth in the art and literary world. Does that sound harsh or cynical? I bet Ms. Plath would agree. Her suicide was a great career move.I just recently read this book and it is well written and interesting. I heard &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; was semi-autobiographical even though it is listed under fiction and called a novel. I mostly wanted to read it because I too have suffered from depression and wanted to see if I could identify with anything Sylvia Plath wrote. Yes I did, with many things. I especially identified with Esther not wanting to bathe and how it seemed a waste of time. I never went three weeks without bathing like she did, but I did get where I considered showering and washing my hair a waste of time, like she said, because we would just have to do it again. That's only one example from the book.I would like to read a good biography of Sylvia Plath now to see if I could get some insight into things that &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; left dangling for me, such as why she/Esther disliked her mother so much."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I have a bad habit of reading the reviews for books before I start reading and I often find myself wondering if I read the same book everyone else did. The Bell Jar was one of those books. I'd heard from several classmates that it was a wonderful book, and I read very positive reviews from this very website, but I found the book to be quite the opposite of what I had expected. Perhaps The Bell Jar is a work that is very limited in it's scope of readers, or perhaps I completely missed the point of this book being written, though I've always prided myself as being a very diligent reader. I read it in one sitting, though I was constantly begging myself to put it down, and I still could not find the connections between all the events in the book. This is a story about the (rather dull) everyday life of a depressed woman where most (if not all) of the notable events take place in the mind. And while stories like this must certainly inspire those in similar positions, I beleive that the events in books should fit together to be unified at the conclusion, and The Bell Jar did not do this for me. There were parts of it I enjoyed and parts that I may even remember, but, having heard the compliments of other reders, I'll humor myself in believing I've read the wrong book."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I cringed when reading the suicidal episodes that Esther Greenwood(Sylvia Plath's alterego) put herself through. I'm thinking, \\" Why would a witty, tall, charming, intelligent girl on college scholarship and great grades and a loving mother want to end it all?\\"I'm a 28 year old male who finds witty and cynical girls like Esther charming so when I came upon the multiple suicide attempts, I'm cringing pissed off thinking, \\"Why?\\"I would be cheating you if I told you - read it and find out. The book was a normal coming of age type book for the first 100 pages, and then all of a suddent Esthter talks of the 19 razors blades she keeps in her purse, and then the entire premise of the novel deepened tenfold and took an unforgettable 180 degree turn into the enigmatic bell jar. When she vividly imagines slitting her wrists I felt nauseous and about to puke wanting to throw the book down. Needless to say, I really got into the novel and the characters -undoubtedly because they're all real people in Plath's life... This classic is deeply disturbing, yet refreshingly redeeming & reinvigorating.FYI: A must read - not just for chics."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The brilliance of The Bell Jar is the realistic way Plath tells Esther's story and the interconnectedness of the elements of her madness. The first statement Esther makes to her reader is how sick she gets at the thought of being electrocuted. Later, after she comes more undone mentally, she goes through electric shock therapy and, hearing a story about a man who was saved from a suicide attempt, she becomes obsessed with thoughts of suicide. She emerges from her madness and self-destructive thoughts after her friend hangs herself. Yet throughout her experience with madness the fear of going through shock therapy drives her to the brink of suicide.Plath describes madness to feel as if one is under a bell jar. Esther implies the suffocating sensation when she says that wherever she goes, whether to Europe or Asia or the moon, that she will always \\"be sitting under the same glass bell jar, stewing in [her] own sour air.\\" Esther knows that something is not right inside of her, and she knows that it is worse to be afflicted in the mind than in the body, but she is hindered in her ability to communicate or even catalogue her own issues.The most tragic element of The Bell Jar is how closely it parallels Plath's own experience. Plath went through a traumatic experience with electric shock therapy and did eventually end her own life at the age of thirty. The characters seem to closely relate to her family members, as Plath had an overbearing mother like Esther's and lost her father, a European insect expert, at a young age. Sadly, it seems that the realistic nature of Plath's first novel was wrought from her own plunge into madness, yet Plath did not meet the same end as her character."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This book made me go from happy moods to very depressed moods and did not really make me feel better.I liked it for the literary quality but add far as the sorry goes I would recommend people who are suffering from depression to not read this book until you feel better..."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Excellent book, interesting story, I enjoyed it and would recommend it to others.

If you've ever wondered how it feels to go from being normal to planning suicide, this book will lead you step my step into the darkness. Her initial thoughts are probably common, but she dwells on them longer and moves past normal. Since Plath actually did kill herself, it's believed to be an autobiographical novel. Very interesting, but not a happy story. I enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Beautiful use of metaphors, easy to get lost in this one.

What I found interesting is that she took the experiences of the main character from her own life's experiences; therefore, you get an insight into Ms. Plath's personal life and also insight into how mental patients were treated in her time. Since I've always been intrigued by the human condition & it's attendant psychology, although books such as The Bell Jar are not my usual fare, it kept me there with the main character in a personal way. Also, I've always appreciated writing talent. Ms. Plath IS TALENTED. I found her style unlike anything I've previously read and yet very efficient and effective. I enjoyed her use of words and turn of phrases, some of which were very new to me. As for subject matter, however, if you're prone to depression, I wouldn't recommend it."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I had to read this book in my novels class in 12th grade. I enjoyed it so much that I ended up buying it myself a year or two later to read it again. One complaint that I've heard about the book is that it is depressing. Yes- it is depressing, however the story is also very real. Sylvia Plath does a fantastic job of using rich descriptions without it being too wordy. Plath has made the book very down to earth and honest. I bet this book was very controversial in the time it was written. Overall, it is a great read and for it's price it is totally worth it. Esther Greenwood is no doubt a complicated girl, and Plath weaves her story beautifully. Although fairly dark in nature, the story wraps up with the theme of rebirth and renewal. The book is truly inspiring and is a recommended read for anyone going through a difficult time. Suicide is mentioned many times throughout the novel, so be aware of that before purchasing."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I thought twice about reviewing this book even though I rate it highly. What more could I possibly say that hasn't already been said? (Yes, I know, it's hard to believe that a bookworm like me has only just discovered this gem.) But then I started making comparisons with another classic I have read and felt compelled to say something if only to set the record straight.Having noted the blatantly obvious in my usual way, with a Homeresque dimwittedness that I ascribe to age, I dug out Salinger's classic and read it through again, partly to make sure that the five-stars I had given it on Goodreads was justified, also to see if my memory was playing tricks on me or if these classics really are comparable.My conclusion is that \`Catcher in the Rye' is only a four-star read. Comparable, indeed, but lacking in many ways. That said it's important to remember that Holden Caulfield's female counterpart, Esther Greenwood, is also Plath's alter-ego and as such is empowered with the voice of experience.And what an experience. Five-stars all the way."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This is a classic. When reaseaching depression, this book always came up.

I definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The Bell Jar has got to be one the best novels ever written as it clearly and effectively elucidates to its reader the dark, grotesque place of the mind one enters into in the midst of mental illness. It refrains from sugar-coating how that sort of experience actually is and how lonely a person must feel to be a victim of their own irrational mind. Esther Greenwood, a sort of representation in itself of Sylvia Plath, suffers from suicidal depression that leads her through the ever-hyped electro-convulsive shock therapy and eventually into an institution. This novel seems to never be ashamed of laying out the facts, as disturbing or irrational as they may seem, from the maddening, wrenching scenes of shock therapy to the self-deprecating feelings Plath experienced that constantly pushed her towards suicide. I think, however, that one has to reach a certain level of maturity or simply experience of age to really identify with this book. Definitely, further reading of Sylvia Plath's works and life would aid immensely in the comprehension of this novel. No one should pass this up."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This beautifull book written and illustrated by troubled poet/writter, Sylvia Plath, is a work of art.

I believe it has such an association with the issues that may forever face women. Not to be sexist but I don't believe a male would relate as much with the main character. Her femaninity is quite an important part to the understanding of her. She attempts to find her place in society while balancing the expectations around her. This conflict leaves a duel mentality, where one minute she feels inferior to all around her, but the next, she feels she can overcome any obstacle. An inability to cope with such emotions leave her frozen in fear. I believe it to be a tragedy but there is no moment to define it as such, therefor, I think one would really have to relate to the character to understand."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"prior to reading \\"the bell jar\\" i read some of sylvia's unabridged journals and there wasn't much of a departure from her real life and the book. now i understand that writers use their own lives to draw from, but this book wasn't much different from reading her own journal entries. it didn't strike me as this literary masterpiece. if i hadn't read the journal entries perhaps i would have felt differently about the book."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read.I do not know how many times I have read this book, but I suspect it is over 20.

Sylvia Plath has a natural talent for poetry that is dark, lucid and sharp in its heartfelt emotion. Trust that when you read her poetry, it will absorb you and you will walk away drenched in it; it will hang on you in your daily life like a shadow. I strongly recommend reading Sylvia's poetry, specifically Arial and The Colossus. The Bell Jar does not tap into the writing skills that Sylvia is capable of. Perhaps it is because it is more of a recount, a truthful story than a visually painted portrait of the truth that she creates with surrealist imagery in her poems and even in her personal journals. This woman can write on a level of no other. In comparison to her other work this book seems almost written by someone else, or a child Sylvia. I did in fact read this book very quickly in anticipation of what depth Sylvia was to expose of herself. I believe she did just that in this book, in fact it was almost verbatim her life, with names and places slightly changed. Considering that Sylvia's life ended by her own hand, it's frightening to realize how honest this book was regarding her loss of hope. One can't help but wonder if in fact Sylvia planned this book (or it just simply is) her voice crying out from the grave, because it is in fact saying everything that this book is saying; I speak the truth, here is my pain."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"For the last three years I've had The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath on my TBR (to be read) list. Recently when I saw an audio version on CDs, unabridged, I couldn't resist. Wow, this was a wonderful experience, albeit a sad one as well. The reader, Maggie Gyllenhaal, was wonderful. She had just the right voice, the perfect attitude, and even looks a little like Sylvia Plath, so far as I can see from the small photos on the back of the CD case.I knew, going in, that this was to be a book about insanity, and semi-autobiographical. Typical for a first novel, to want to write about oneself. Of course after I listened to the book I had to do a lot more research because I was fascinated by Sylvia Plath and her brief but eventful life. She was primarily a poet and short story writer who received a guest editorship position at Mademoiselle magazine in New York City by winning a short story contest in 1953. This is where her novel, The Bell Jar, starts, though she renamed the magazine, the main character, and the hotel at which she stayed.In the book, the protagonist, Esther Greenwood, gradually falls apart mentally while interning at a magazine in New York City. She eventually has to leave to move back in with her mother, and from there things get worse. If you compare the novel with her actual life, there are many similarities.In real life, she recovered from her breakdown and married Ted Hughes, another poet. They had two children and lived in England and later, in Massachusetts. Her first and only novel, The Bell Jar, was published on January 14, 1963 in England under a pseudonym, Victoria Lucas. Less than a month later, on February 11, 1963, Sylvia Plath took her own life using gas fumes from her oven. She must have been depressed due to a separation from her husband due to his infidelity, and the pressures of being a single parent, isolated, and unable to afford adequate winter heating or even a telephone.I hope someday to read her unedited journals and some of her poetry, and perhaps some short stories. There also are several biographies about her available. She had an amazing talent for putting the reader in the midst of a situation, right into the thinking process of a deranged protagonist. I felt the narrative of her novel was phenomenally well done. She knew first hand about insanity, and let us in on the secret of how it could happen and what it is like to fall apart mentally, gradually, one step at a time. It is definitely a novel I'd put on my list of books every serious reader should experience at least once."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The Bell Jar, written by Sylvia Plath, takes the reader on a very in depth and personal trip through depression. The book is written through the eyes of Esther Greenwood, the priveledged college student struggling to find reality and her true self throughout the book. While she should be having the time of her life, Esther sinks deeper into the depths of severe depression. She loses most of her sense of reality, which distorts her mind and eventually even her vision. What Plath leads the reader to believe is that Esther is brought to depression due to her lack of relationships with others. Esther seems to make minimal effort to form any kind of relationships, which leads her into isolation from the world and her life. Although she does form friendships with some characters throughout the book, in her mind she still cannot relate to them.This book was very appropriately named, because when Esther reaches her deepest points of depression, it is as if a bell jar has come down over her, which isolates her from the world. Her mind and vision become so distorted that it is like she is looking through its glass and living her life from underneath it. What is interesting and unique about this book is that it is written through the eyes of Esther. Sylvia Plath is able to take the reader through all stages of extreme depression in some intense and disturbing detail. She must have experienced some form of depression in her life to be able to describe depression so accurately from the viewpoint of Esther.The Bell Jar is an incredibly creative, yet disturbing book with an intirely new aspect for the reader."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The &quot;Bell Jar&quot; was a facinating book of life and confusion. I found it intriguing. And a very well written book that I think every English class should read because it demonstrates how much you should value your life because you don't know how good you have it. I only gave this book a 4 star rating because I thought it was a bit confusing and hard to follow because every page had a flashback in it, making it difficult to know when she's talking about the present or the past. It still is a very good book, and i recommend that everyone with at least an 8th grade reading level read the &quot;Bell Jar.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The Bell Jar is an increadibly understandable account of the experiences of a woman as she goes insane. Through every word of the book, I could almost rationalize her feelings as she goes insane. Seeing her life through her eyes, she dosn't seem as insane as she may actually have been. The mindset of The Bell Jar is so different from what that which we feel on a regular daily basis, but while reading the book you almost begin to think like Esther. The Bell Jar is one of the very few books that can take a serious, fictional approach to real-life insanity. And of course, the bell jar may have lifted off of Esther at the end of the book, but it obviously did once again descend on Sylvia Plath."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I read this book in my 9th grade honors english class.

Her creative way of writing, and interesting aspect on life let's you see a double-side to things.

It was about a girl that has quite a few problems that she has a hard time dealing with. It is very clear that Sylvia Plath has her own problems and she revolves them around the life as Esther,who she portrays. It is sad how she has to get shock treatments. What I learned is that in the beginning of the book she talks about not wanting to ever be electocuted, like the Rosenbergs.

She is not beautiful, not necessarily brilliant. She is plain with brown hair and brown eyes. As far as her brilliance, she was a big fish in a small pond at her college and when she reaches the big city she begins to see how insignificant she really is. I love this novel, it is by far one of my favorites. Part of the beauty of the novel is that Esther is not this gorgeous, perfect person. She is a normal person who catches a lucky break and spends the remainder of the novel trying to figure out how to repeat her luck; then dealing with it when that does not happen. She is a real character. She is all of us. There is no prince charming.

Twenty-plus years after my first reading, I found myself wallowing in depression, trying to make sense of it all, with a hankering to revisit The Bell Jar. It was even better the second (well, actually fourth or fifth) time around -- not only could I relate to Esther Greenwood's horrid isolation, I could also see the humor and wit this time, and relate not only to Esther's personal desperation, but also her mother's desperation to ensure that she was okay and her inability to do so. Esther stews over / tinkers with / attempts suicide in a variety of ways, underscoring the chronic nature of depression. Oddly, reading The Bell Jar didn't bring me down at all -- rather, it made me think about how gripping depression can be if one never confronts it head-on and conquers it (assuming such is possible)."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"it's a shame that Sylvia Plath did not have the opportunity to write more fiction. This novel is funny, insightful and haunting. Her sense of humor is fantastic, I've read this book over again and I'm amazed at how right on she can be. Free from the &quot;find your inner child, what mommy and daddy did to me&quot; psychobabble so overabundant in the &quot;when I went a little cuckoo&quot; books of our era, Plath's telling is fresh, honest and different. (I'm not poo-pooing societies ability to get in touch with themselves, perhaps if Sylvia Plath had lived today she might have been able to cope better, I am just remarking that it makes for a different kind of read)."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The Bell Jar was a very good book. As I began reading it I was very interested, and as I proceeded into the book it became even more interesting. From the way that the book started out, I never thought that it would turn out as it did. When the main character, Esther, was introduced she seemed like a nice, very smart young lady that did no wrong. As I kept reading, until I finally came to the end, I realized that I was mislead and she had a lot of problems that you would not think someone like her would have. I really liked the way the author set up the story and the ending that she wrote for this particular story. The different kinds of people that you met throughout the story lead you to the understanding that Esther was different than most and did have some problems. While she was in New York everytime that one of her fellow contest winners would invite her to do something she would deny the invitation and either stay in her room and do nothing, or she would go out into the city and view the downside of it. I thought it was good for her to explore all aspects of the city, but she never wanted to do things with her fellow winners. It made the story really interesting and made me to not want to put the book down. I would refer this book to anyone whom likes stories that leave you confused when you find out that someone or something is totally different than what you had thought or was presented to be."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This is a great book. It neatly shows how those with psychiatric problems may look normal on the outside but inside they are rotting (and I think I am entitled to use the word rotting). Plath's work clearly demonstrates how even the most promising are in reality just a few steps away from personal hells. The descriptions of electro-convulsive therapy are terrifying (although the process has suppousedly been made less barbaric today). It would be interesting to read this book if it had been written today when psychotropic drugs are somewhat more effective."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath is the most intriguing book that I have ever read. Her approach to a young woman's insanity is absolutely stunning and should be read by everyone. She has a poetic flow to her writing and describes everything so well that it is easy to create images in your mind while you read it. At one point in the book, I actually had to put it down because the character, Esther, was so convincing that I felt as if she were right in front of me, living the life that Plath created for her. The Bell Jar is extremely unique, strong and poetic, and it is a shame that Sylvia Plath descended into her own depression and killed herself not long after completing the book."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I first read this work when I was in about 9th grade. However, because I had been so young and it had been so long ago when I read it I couldn't really remember anything but key elements and such. So, I decided to pick it up and read it again. This amazing work really gives you some insight of how sometimes privileged people fall to pieces. She paints a vivid picture of how painful life was like for her, and how she felt completely alienated by everyone except her therapist. The ending could be seen as a bit rushed, but the general feeling remains in tact. Definitely a great book to learn more about severe depression, and about her life."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Plath was an incredible and intense mind. Through her writing, she sent emotions and feeling to an incredible amount of people. The story of The Bell Jar is really Plath letting her being seep out onto paper. The writing is classic and leads me to believe that the whole idea of &quot;sanity&quot; has become almost non existent, as well as overrated."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The book tells the story of a young English major who finds herself breaking down mentally and being treated by electric shock in a special institute. This novel is said to be based on the life of the author, Sylvia Plath.Is Esther a younger version of Sylvia, or just a wannabe girl with ambitions to become a poet / author / journalist? Or maybe this is just the way Sylvia sees herself, denying all her literary accomplishments? I find that to be one of the most interesting questions raised in the book.I sensed that Esther's main problem was not knowing how to handle the world around her once she got out of the &quot;perfect&quot; environment of being a star pupil in school and college, and living in a world where she might not be the &quot;star&quot; but the average person or even fail evry once in a while... She starts to feel confused while staying in NYC. Even though she got that stay as a prize in a competition, and the prize could be seen as a high point for her, once she gets there she finds herself in social and personal situations she just can't handle properly. Some are minor, such as drinking the water meant for cleaning her fingers in dinner - and some more serious, like getting involved with Doreen's newfound friends, and finding out too late that she'd rather spend time with the &quot;nicer&quot; girls, boring as they might be compared to the former.When she finally gets back home, she experiences the first &quot;academic&quot; failure she has in a while - not being accepted to a writing course she was absolutely sure she'd get into. She hadn't made other plans, and is so shocked by the failure she just spends her time doing nothing in her mom's house, and that eventually drives her to think the thoughts and ask the questions that eventually break her down.Her treatment at the institute sounds like a &quot;standard&quot; and obvious, but I found the descriptions of the other patients rather amusing in a cynical and black humor sort of way...Esther has a very distorted view of men. The sofisticated men of New York all turn out to be creeps and empty headed people, the guy wshe chooses to lose her virginity with is a calculated women chaser, and even Buddy, who seems to be the perfect guy at first - handsome and smart medical student - turns out to be the sort of person who looks down on Esther, her ambitions and thoughts, and her mental situation."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I read this book under the impression that it would be a stereotypical mental illness book. Once i read the first chapter i knew that it was different from any other book that i've read. The emotions that she goes through. The way she describes her feelings. I was enraptured throughout the entire story. I couldn't believe that someone could go through something like she did. It was unbelievable. And the ways she pondered her suicide, i never knew that was possible. For some reason or another, it appealed to me when she explained the she wanted to draw a warm bath and slit her wrists, watching her red blood flow out of them. Likes red clouds. I don't understand why that was so appealing to me. It was a incredible book and it opens your eyes to the possibilities that a human can go through."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This book is really incredible. It is a really short read and it has this great way of sucking you in. The whole time I was reading it I felt as if I was going crazy right along with the main character!

They will always come alive...remain fresh."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This book has reached many audiences--feminists, mental health experts, depressed people, young people, and the literary community, to name a few. Rather than take any of these viewpoints, I rated the book based on what kind of reading experience it provided to me. I was expecting something really emotionally intense. The story is interesting but not compelling. It was frequently disjointed and did not seem polished, and I can understand why the original editors rejected it. Many comparisons have been made to the works of J.D. Salinger, but in my opinion this book falls far short of Salinger's works on all counts. The setting is very dated because of references to the prices of things (dresses costing a few dollars, expensive restaurant dishes and taxicab fares under a dollar), and the details of how women dressed (high heels, stockings with lines on the back that had to be kept straight, etc.) I actually found this aspect of the book to be interesting. Many reviewers have noted humor in the book. I found very little humor. I think the fame of this book rests on the fact that it was in the right place in the right time. The same book written these days would never have seen print. It is worth reading for its place in literary and social history, but it just isn't the reading experience you might be anticipating. It did leave me feeling great sadness for the author and the suffering she experienced."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I had to read the Bell Jar for my English class and write a research paper on it. To be honest, reading it was not one of the most joyous times of my life. The book maily focuses on the depressing parts of Esther and her monotonous life. All throughout the book she is falling down on her knees and has not stregnth not get back up and face the world. She continually hides from people and does not show the true person she is. Esther has no self confidence and wishes to seduce the first man who comes across her path. She is a desperate person with little self moral. But, on a good note, Plath writes about her depression so descriptively, you actually feel like you are going down with Esther. I would not recommend this book to the person wishing to read something for fun, but for the more serious and mature reader. Reading a book for fun is what Harry Potter is for. Hope this helps alot!"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"There have been plenty of novels that since The Bell Jar have described in painstaking detail the morbid coldness of a psych ward experience, and people who've been through it may more closely relate with these recentworks, as certainly the psychiatric field has changed since 1953. However, Plath's experience is both personal yet easily relatable. We feel in her body when she's receiving the electric shock treatments; we feel in her head as she tries to make sense of why death is so appealing; we feel in her heart as she tries to understand what love is, and why she hasn't even come close to it. Plath clouds Esther's thoughts with plenty of vivid imagery and similes, and by the book's completion, we wish it wasn't over.FULL REVIEW:[...]"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The Bell Jar is an accurate and soulful story of a brilliant woman who fights constant psycholoical battles. The writing is spectacular and the story itself is thoroughly captivating. Worth a couple of re-reads!"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The Bell Jar was one of the most substantial things written by Sylvia Plath, who was world-renowned for being one of America's best poets. In college I took an array of poetry classes, I enjoyed them to an extent, and I always did well in them. But poetry has never really affected me like it has other people. A lot of it is pretentious, and a lot of it is hard to understand. But Plath eased in well to prose; it was excellent.Initially this wasn't a big seller (partly due to her using the pseudonym \\"Victoria Lucas\\"), but after her very tragic suicide in 1963, the novel took on a new fame.It's about a smart college girl in the 1950s; starts just after the Rosenbergs are electrocuted (as it states on page one). This young woman is spending a semester in New York City working for a reputable fashion magazine, as an intern, winning her spot with twelve others for academic excellence: for her it was writing a particular poem. The book follows her life for approximately a year; from New York to Massachusetts (Plath's originally from Boston). It's a \\"confessional-prose\\" masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Sylvia Plath's story--both in real life, and in this work of \\"fiction\\"--is undeniably sad. I purchased this book after, by chance, catching the last 15 minutes of the movieSylviaon tele (which piqued my interest in her story). I instantly fell in love with the mood of this book. Sylvia's style as an author is undeniable.I am tempted to compare the main character of this story (which is, in fact, a not-so-\\"fictionalized\\" autobiographical account of Sylvia's entry into young adulthood)to J.D. Salinger's Holden Caulfield (ofThe Catcher in the Rye, for those not familiar). However, that might be a bit oversimplistic. When you consider the social climate and its implications for women in the era of this book, you may find it all the more compelling that the main character behaves as she does. I won't give too much away, but I will say that Plath does a remarkable job of creating a character for whom her readers will likely experience many conflicting impressions and feelings.You will likely walk away from this book feeling frustrated and curious. Go with it! I highly recommendSylvia Plath: Method and Madness: A Biographyas subsequent reading. Why? Because only after reading Sylvia's biography can you realize how very much of 'The Bell Jar' was based in reality--and that, in turn, will solidify whatever feelings it evoked in you. I found myself turning back to 'The Bell Jar' constantly just to note the similarities as I read that biography. At the end of both, I cannot deny that although Sylvia's life and story was very different than my own (and that, as a person, she was someone I probably would not have felt *warm and fuzzy* toward in 'real life'), I walked away from both books feeling somehow sorrowfully connected to her and her tragic life--which undoubtedly ended much too soon."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This is one of my all time fave books.

It was her works that lead me into the realm of poetry. When I discovered that she had written a book, I was beyond thrilled. It always humbles me to take an adventure through her life guided by her vivid imagery, and this book was certainly nothing short of that.The Bell Jar starts at a point in her life where she is in New York apprenticing as a journalist for a magazine. It is here that her mental stability begins to decay. From that time on, the main character, Esther Greenwood, reflects on the events in her life that lead up to her condition.As someone with a generally differing take on life, I appreciate this book for it's representation of the alternative mind set. This book does not come out and say that the main character is ill, they set up her depression as a chronic piece of Esther's life. The presentation of a serious mental state being shown to the world as something relatable and relatively normal is, I think, a commendable ability. With that in mind, I would recommend it to anyone who is opened to an opposing thought process, it may just change your view on life."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read.

One poem that instantly got my attention was &quot;Lady Lazarus&quot; by Sylvia Plath. Since that day I have been a fan of Sylvia Plath. When I first picked up The Bell Jar for the first time, I knew it was going to be a very interesting book, but it wasn't until after I finished it when I found out that an author can grasp the world and shove it all into one book.

The main character, Esther Greenwood (a hero fashioned after Sylvia) barely survives the trials and tribulations of a life which includes electroshock and temporary &quot;insanity.&quot; Her life is sheltered under a suffocating bell jar which distorts reality into a pessimitically biased version of the truth. To escape this life-style, Esther attempts suicide on several occasions (many of which paralleling the attempts of Sylvia). The bell jar is a depressing, but accurate, account of a less-than-ideal life. Esther will have you weeping and laughing as she attempts to lead a normal life-style.

Plath took apart the details of the life that hides behind a depressed soul, not giving definition to, but relating to those who suffer the same. One knows a truly well written book by how involved one gets into the lives of its characters. The time that I spent reading this book brought me to look at my own life. As a result, I lapsed into one of my depressive spells, but this was no ordinary &quot;hate life&quot; spell. I recognized so much that I shared with Esther. I asked my psychology teacher, who recommended the book to me, if most of his students come back to him and tell him that the book affected them in the same way it affected me.

I first read the book during high school, when Plath became my favorite poet, and I have since read the book about a dozen times. It is a sad tale, but that is what makes it so moving for me. This book is definitely one that I would recommend, but not if you feel it would hit too close to home."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I read this book for the first time this summer, and after I had read it I wished that I had read it sooner. Everything she wrote made perfect sense to me and it made me think a lot about my life and where I was going and the idea that I could be grossly underprepared for everything. If I have ever wanted to write like anyone it would be Sylvia Plath. Her life is tragic but it makes her work so much more compelling. Her novel helped millions of people except her. I recommend it be read."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Thinking this would be a novel solely concerned with little more than the shock treatments of a young woman, I put off reading this for years. Big mistake. This is vibrant writing by a sensitive woman going through her tender years. There are probably fewer than three pages, together, having to do with her treatments; the rest is a feast of what living up to expectations following early successes (being published, working for a big magazine) might be like. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Plath wrote this book as an autobiography of herself.

I felt that Sylvia Plath was writing about me, although the time, location and the people involved in the story were fairly different from what I had.

The Bell Jar made me happy because I felt that I wasn't the only one in such a situation."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"i first read this book when in highschool, during a time of bitter depression. Plath's honest and witty (and painfull) look at the life of this young, intensely smart woman opened my eyes to a new way of reading and writing...It was like reading Catcher in the Rye except from a woman's point of view and it fascinated me, despite Plath's own sad ending. this book inspired me to write and years later i still find it inspiring--I overcame my depression, however my appreciation of the way she crafted her raw, honest pain into something artistic and beautiful has never dwindled. This book is amazing."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Sylvia Plath has influenced me more than any other writer ever has. In The Bell Jar, she engulfs the reader in a story that's pretty much her autobiography. To read this book is to delve into the mind of the author herself.

A true classic."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Even though I (fortunately) neither suffer from depression as severe as Esther's nor have to deal with the oppressiveness of the 1950s, I found her thought patterns very familiar as I have just started therapy for my depression. Many complain about how her thoughts seem disjointed, but her writing style seemed to follow my own thought patterns, something that fuels the frustration of the disease even more. The book made me feel very fortunate to live in the 1990s, when sympathetic psychologists don't dismiss irrational feelings, and pills keep me from having to endure shock treatments or other such practices."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The spiral towards insanity is painful, abrupt.

There is a lot of stuff in it that I would not have fully understood if I had continued to read it at age 16...I sort of compare this book to She's come undone by Wally Lamb; about a young girl going through life \\"crazy\\".

The novel takes place in the sixties -- a time in which depression hadn't been delved into as much as it is now. While her mental condition worsened, Plath escaped her bizarre life by writing poetry. She'd also written this book. Even though she'd lost her battle with depression, Plath left this wonderful book as her legacy. The Bell Jar is poignant, twisted, surreal and, more importantly, insightful. By far, one of the best books I've read all year. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"&quot;The Bell Jar&quot; is an excellent piece of literature with a feminest feeling.

Considering just how dramatic her life was (that ended in suicide), and how much she was such a melodramatic person (a scene between her husband and his mistress), I was a bit disappointed to find that this semi-autobiographical book isn't dramatic enough. She told the story in almost monotone, teenage, and detach way, even though at rare points she does become &quot;involved&quot;. I guess I was expecting to read a much more &quot;gut wrenching dramatic&quot; story telling considering that her actual life WAS like that."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I picked this book up because I knew it'd been a classic read, but somehow throughout school I'd missed having it on any of my reading lists.

Unlike the people who pretend to read on a Kindle or Ipad, I prefer a hard copy. And it sure beats the hell out of paying $30 for a new copy. Unlike an electronic reader, I didn't have to feel anxious about bringing it to the beach, or resting my beer on it. 10 out of 10."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Forget the gut wrenching drama, the emotional twists and turns, the stunningly alive characterization, this book is just plain beautifully written, surpassing even Catcher in the Rye in its raw power."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Sylvia really writes from a \\"someone who gets it\\" perspective. I appreciate her raw demeanor and honesty. I found myself relating to her immediately as she drew my mind further and further onto the pages of this novel.***Caution: Unfortunately, I was already at a low point in my emotional cycles (BPD and BD), so when she was contemplating suicide, so was I. By continuing reading I pushed myself all the way over the edge and woke up alive the next day in the ICU at a hospital. So, DO NOT READ if you are at all at a low point!!!"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Sylvia Plath has in many circles been something of the poster child for modern nihilism, almost to the point of a cultural in-joke (see Fight Club), but the first thing I was struck with was how witty and humorous The Bell Jar starts. For example, this passage:\\"I'd discovered, after a lot of extreme apprehension about what spoons to use, that if you do something incorrect at table with a certain arrogance, as if you knew perfectly well you were doing it properly, you can get away with it and nobody will think you are bad mannered or poorly brought up. They will think you are original and very witty.\\"Second, it didn't take long to figure out how much modern \\"chick lit\\" owes to Plath. Before shopaholics and Prada-wearing Devils, Plath had already been there and done that, all the way down to the poor girl working in the NYC fashion magazine angle.Third, I was touched by the humanity that Plath brings to some tricky subjects: coming of age, sexuality, career-setting, societal pressure, care for the mentally ill, homosexuality, and social shallowness, just to name a few. Her descriptions of Esther Greenwood's trip into madness isn't like watching a specimen under her famous bell jar; you get the feeling that you're watching a living, breathing human being who is trying to find a way out of the mental and emotional box canyons in which she feels trapped.I felt myself connected to Esther in ways that I didn't feel in that other work of 60's young adult angst, The Catcher in the Rye. Where Esther Greenwood is smart, creative, troubled, and desperate, Holden Caulfield is merely smug, whiny, spoiled, and self-obsessed. It's not hard to see why Caulfield resonated with many 60's social elites, since they share some of the same characteristics. In my opinion, Sallinger and Plath shouldn't even share shelf space--The Bell Jar is a deeper, more emotionally involved, and ultimately better written work.Plath's first calling was as a poet; The Bell Jar was the only novel she ever published. Her poet's background served her well, as her prose flows along the pages. I think the book starts a bit better than it ends, but her writing style throughout is a wonder.As for The Bell Jar being a scathing commentary on her personal acquaintances, I didn't get that vibe. It's hard to know what those personal relationships were like, but I got these sense of a person writing about what she knew (Plath had her own mental breakdown in 1953). I can see where some of those people would have been offended, but The Bell Jar was supposed to be the first half of a two volume work, the other half of which was never produced due to Plath's untimely death.Lastly, it's good to remember that The Bell Jar was written in the early sixties and largely prefigures the feminist movement. It's often waved around as a feminist novel, and it certainly takes up some of those themes, but The Bell Jar predates political feminism, and in one of the more poignant passages, foresees the arguments of feminism and their ultimate rejection. Part of the passage is:\\"Of course, the famous woman poet at my college lived with another woman--a stumpy old Classical scholar with a cropped Dutch cut. And when I told the poet I might well get married and have a pack of children someday, she stared at me in horror. \`But what about your career?' she had cried.My head ached. Why did I attract these weird old women? There was the famous poet, and Philomena Guinea, and Jay Cee, and the Christian Scientist lady and lord knows who, and they all wanted to adopt me in some way, and, for the price of their care and influence, have me resemble them.\\"In the end, The Bell Jar is a remarkable work--not merely just important, but also a good read. If you haven't read it yet, you should. It's amazing to think what Plath might have written had she lived longer."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"One might think that a novel about a young college woman's experience with madness in the mid-20th century would come across as dated or even quaint. On the contrary, as I read I found myself nodding emphatically, and even calling up friends to tell them about passages I'd read that were particularly familiar. This reaction emphasizes The Bell Jar's staying power after half a century; any ambitious young woman who has struggled with anxiety about their future, or felt like a square peg in society's round hole, will find themselves identifying with this novel.The story is heavy with the weight of the author's suicide; in fact, the novel is so close to Plath's own experiences that it wasn't published in the United States until after her death, as she was afraid of hurting the real-life people who were thinly veiled as characters in the novel. While the Bell Jar is an important novel in its own right, it will also give readers a more nuanced perspective on Plath's poetry.The Bell Jar sheds light on psychiatric care in the 1950's, under the stifling expectations of a woman's role in post-war America. The novel explores themes of feminism and mental health without being didactic; Esther's insights feel relevant and real today, while revealing much about the society in which Plath herself came of age. Some find heroine Esther Greenwood's descent into mental illness to be depressing, but I found her story to be ultimately life-affirming; Plath avoids nihilism by not merely focusing on Esther's breakdown, but also her recovery.You needn't have spent time under \\"the bell jar\\" (Plath's metaphor for the extreme anxiety and depression felt by the young protagonist) to appreciate this novel; Plath makes the workings of Esther's mind accessible and real. Plath's matter-of-fact style makes neurotic thoughts and suicide fantasies feel almost ordinary; Esther's struggles seem like a perfectly natural response to a world full of date hypocrites and phonies. Some readers may empathize more than others (a friend told me \\"it's like we all become our own version of Esther Greenwood while we're reading the book\\"), but it's difficult to be unaffected by what has become one of the most iconic novels about mental illness, feminism, and the youth experience."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I have always loved this book. Plath's literature is exceptional, in my opinion. But the reason I bought this copy, even though I already own one, is because there are a few of Plath's sketches included in this edition. It may seem insignificant, but for someone who likes Plath, this should be quite a treat!"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Bad Girls ClubI read this book every summer and have for the last few years. Plath is so apt at capturing her own descent into insanity, one little step at a time. She takes you on her journey with her in such a way that you truly feel her slip into this other world. I enjoy it most because it's flawless and as a writer, I have studied Plath to try and understand how she made everything work so well together. I would recommend this book to anyone who has ever suffered loss."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Great book! Beautifully written.

You can really taste the words and the madness inside of the character. It amplifies madness and beauty. It sits on a place of honor, on my shelf of favorites.Buy it and read it. The story will sweep you off your feet and drag you into the realms of madness.Taste and see."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I originally read The Bell Jar in an introductory English course at the University of Texas. I remember staying up late at night reading this book, as it captivated me from the first sentence. In class, we went over a brief background of Sylvia Plath's life and the personal, political, social, etc. environment in which the book was written. I remember looking at pictures of Sylvia Plath in class, with her All-American good looks and obvious intelligence, then going home to read the dark thoughts and insecurities that she described in The Bell Jar. I remember being perplexed by this book, as I could not understand why such a successful and beautiful, young lady would ever even think about comitting suicide. I also coudn't understand why she was so \\"turned-off\\" by the world and every important person in her life (i.e. her mother, her father, Buddy Willard, etc.). I mean, I loved this book from the beginning but I was left with many questions regarding Sylvia Plath, herself.Well, I am now two years removed from college and I have gone through some tragedy of my own. I was recently diagnosed with Generalized-Anxiety-Disorder (GAD) and had to get treatment for it. I have since been \\"cured,\\" but in re-reading The Bell Jar I couldn't help but admire how Plath makes the decent of Esther Greenwood into borderline insanity seem rational, if not altogether normal. I may also add that I had recently read The Catcher in the Rye and I got great joy out of paralleling Holden and Esther as I worked through the book. In addition, I researched Sylvia's life more in depth and watched the movie SYLVIA, with Gwyneth Paltrow portraying Sylvia Plath. This added background made all the difference in the world in regards to my experience with this book. As if I hadn't already enjoyed the book so much more my second time reading it, I found the answer to my questions in the \\"Biographical Note\\" section of the book. In it, Aurelia Plath, Sylvia's mom, describes Sylvia's intended message in the Bell Jar, as explained by Sylvia during a conversation with her mother shortly before her suicide:\\" 'What I've done...is to throw together events from my own life, fictionalizing to add color...I think it will show how isolated a person feels when he is suffering a breakdown...I've tried to picture my world and the people in it as seen through the distorting lens of a bell jar.'\\" \\"The very title The Bell Jar should imply what Sylvia told me and that is what the astute reader should infer...\\"Now, I know that Sylvia wasn't \\"turned-off\\" by the important people in her life so much as she was seeing them through the distorted lens of the bell jar. Thus, she wasn't herself and other people's behavior seemed superficial and irrational to her when in reality it was her behavior that was irrational and to a certain extent superficial.Despite the criticisms of this book, I would reccomend everyone to buy this book and read it with this last notion in mind."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"At first, the main character's psyhcosis seemed almost logical. Then, slowly Ester Greenwood lost touch. Plath did a great job of leading the reader along with Ester as she experienced it. I found myself really pulling for her and hoping that she would get better. It is a stomach turning coincidence that Ester feared the Bell Jar would return because it certainly did for the author. It was a very interesting read and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I opened the book and found it a quick read, but I noticed that something was missing. Then I figured it out. Sylvia Plath's brilliance is contained in her poetry. Her book does convey her message quite well (at least what most people consider the message to be) and it is fantastically well written and contains many of the contrasts and comparisons betweeen two seemingly very unrelated things, which distinguishes her work, but it lacks luster. It seems great upon first read, but when compared to her poetry, it is like a candle that is lit, but sputtering. I think her book is a more logical explanation of her madness, but it doesn't make her seem like she is mentally ill. She makes you feel like she is healthy and the rest of the world is sick. Kudos for putting us in her shoes. But aside from that, the rest of the story seems drab, despite the imagery. It didn't evoke many feelings in me. I think literature is meant to stir and inspire. But maybe she just wanted us to feel nothing at all, as if we were trapped under a bell jar and the only thing you can feel is the pain which is so persistant that eventually you become used to it and don't feel it anymore. I guess that's the reason I didn't like the book as well as I should have. She intended for us to feel nothing at all."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Don't be put off by the book's reputation as the story of a depressed not-quite-a-woman-not-a-girl protagonist--and certainly don't be put off by the fact that Sylvia Plath died very soon after writing the book. Although she is known primarily for her poetry, I've often thought that Bell Jar captured both her skill as a sharp poetess, but also her lesser-known sense of humor. The Bell Jar involves suicide attempts and mental institutions, but more importantly, it doesn't dwell on tragedy so much as cut through it. Plath's photographic depiction of what it is like to be thrust into adulthood and all the other things that aren't in childhood are equally important and remind the reader that the things that we experience are neither so beautiful nor ugly as they are absurd.Whether or not you've ever been depressed, the Bell Jar captures not only the fear of nothing ever changing, but also the greater fear of things being different, twin processes which are, to me, at the heart of depression."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The Bell Jar, by Slvia Plath, is a somewhat autobiography of the author's life. To begin the book we meet Esther, an aspiring author who gets a chance to go to New York to work on a magazine. While in New York, Esther realizes the phoniness of the people around her and that she has serious problems dealing with society as a whole. Esther in a downward spiral of dispair and confusion, takes a whole bottle of sleeping pills. Having survived from her overdose Esther is admitted to a mental institution where she is forced to discover her true self, and remove the bell jar that is suffocating her. Sylvia, the author, does an amazing job portraying Esther's raw emotions and inner desires. This is a wonderful book for anyone who liked The Catcher in the Rye, and Girl Interuppted. The Bell Jar has the same pesimistic attitude toward society. Slylvia is a great author with many classics under her belt and this is yet another to add to the list."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Although this partially auto-biographical book written by Sylvia Plath is most commonly discussed in feminist groups and psychology classes, its a book for the likes of anyone who's ever felt a bit out of touch with reality. Plath was an excellent poet, and an extremely good author. The fact that this is her only novel is quite disappointing. This book is easier read than almost any other I've ever picked up. Its a better written Catcher In The Rye. One that doesn't so much focus on the whining and complaining about life, but more of the spiral of feeling insane and like an outsider. Don't get me wrong. In no way is this a take-off of Catcher In The Rye. It is as unique as any book that you could get your hands on. That's what makes it so brilliant. Also, I think anyone who reads this book should try their very hardest to read Plath's poetry along with it. It will make you understand her world on a bit more of an artistic level. Basically, I can't stress enough how important this novel is to American Literature. Someday, this book will be in as high of regard with the literary greats as Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre and Shakespeare's MacBeth."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The Bell Jar is an interesting read that one could pick up and get through in a couple of sittings or less. The book follows a 1950's college aged woman who finds herself while simultaneously going \\"under\\". The book has an interesting autobiographical element to it and this version has a superb section about the life of Plath, which I found fascinating after reading the book.For me the most interesting aspect of the book is the way Plath delves into the psyche of this woman who is losing a grip on reality. It's surprisingly and disturbingly sad and funny at the same time. I could relate to some of her apparent disinterest but other than that I've never been exposed to someone who has been deemed by society to be \\"officially\\" crazy. At times I wondered if she really had a problem all along or if everyone around her were such \\"conformists\\" that she was just out of place. Also the portrayal of 1950's psychiatric treatment was well done in an entertaining manner but not convincingly accurate.The writing is a uniquely stylized 1st person perspective and I felt like Esther was telling me this story face to face. It's disappointing that Plath's life ended so early as her ability to write novels might of rivaled her poetry skills.I would recommend this book to casual readers as it moves quickly and is easy to follow. Appropriate for people over 18 although most high school students could probably handle it. Contains sexual situations and adult themes.Bottom Line: A well-written fascinating portrayal of how quickly someone who is \\"normal\\" can fall from grace. Great window into 50's society and expectations."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"An in-depth look at the struggles of a young woman. Reviewer: Linville LA Student from Linville, Louisiana I really enjoyed this book because it took you inside the mind and heart of Esther Greenwood. You always knew how she was feeling. The Bell Jar is a story about a successful woman who struggles with her inner self and some social issues. She gradually slips into a deep, dark depression and struggles to find the light of day again. She has problems with her mother. She can't seem to get a relationship worth keeping. She had problems finding someone she could trust; someone that could and would help her. She admits herself to an asylum, where she spends a lot of time. Shock therapy was proven ineffective and therefore pointless. She just drifts deeper and deeper into her state of depression until she does not even know who she is. The only thing I didn't really like was the ending of the book. You never find out what happens to Esther. Her destiny is left up to the individual reader."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Living with bipolar disorder myself, she captures some of the nuances of depression and describes them very well. The nonchalant approach to ending one's own life, like doing the laundry or cutting the grass comes across accurately. (from experience) The emotional struggles, most who have suffered with major depression will find something deeply connecting with this book. Read and comprehend this book the way it was meant to be, you will find another world that does exist in some of us.I have found her writing so captivating, the descriptions, simple but effective. She saw a different world, as most of us do, but to write the way she does takes talent. This book led me to read her unabridged journals. An amazing, intelligent but damaged woman."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I think the reason why a lot of people haven't taken to her writing style is because you have to keep in mind that Sylvia Plath was, first and foremost, a poet - not a novelist. There is an honesty and poetic quality that embodies every single word of this book. This is not a book that was written to make people feel sorry for her and if you met Esther Greenwood in real life you may not even like her, but one thing you do come away with after reading this book is an understanding of how a person can go from functional to suicidal in a matter of days.It's hard to understand under what conditions a person could commit suicide if you have never attempted it yourself (I never have.) And if you can't understand, you can't appreciate how real a suicidal person's feelings are. In this book, Sylvia lays out her feelings and thoughts with such honesty and poignancy that it literally becomes painful to imagine her suffering.Besides suicide, the other major issue covered in this book is the feminist double-standard. Why is it that men who sleep with many women are congratulated and women who sleep with many men are socially chastised? She touches on this subject through her encounters with men. You can feel her frustration and anger with the double-standard and you know (knowing what is to come later on in the book) that this only exacerbates her feelings of hopelessness.It's sad that poets are so underappreciated in our society. Overall, this is one of the best books written... ever. Poets write great prose because they see beauty and sadness where others see ordinary. Then they translate this to the written word and it becomes a glorious celebration of language."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"'The Bell Jar' remains one of the best books ever written on depression, far better than say 'Prozac Nation' or 'She's Come Undone'. However, unless the reader has experienced depression firsthand, they may have difficulty relating to the protagonist. Those who criticize this book will always demand a rational reason for Ester's depression. This isn't very different from the way people act in real life. People who have never experienced depression firsthand fail to miss something: there isn't a rational reason for depression. In depression, the word 'rational' doesn't exist. It could be a cause of many things, often times being a chemical imbalance in the brain. Let's just say this: depression can happen to anyone. It doesn't matter if you're rich and privileged, successful, or loved. Depression is uncontrollable and it's not something a person can merely 'snap out of'.So what is it about 'The Bell Jar' that makes it superior to its imitators? Perhaps its the book's sense of humor. Whether talking about movies shot in Technicolor or 'scandal sheets' (aka: tabloids), society is viewed through a humorous yet almost sardonic-like telescope. The book is roughly edited, and the run-on sentences and random observations give it a more personal feel. To this day, 'The Bell Jar' remains a great testimonial on what depression feels like."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"It's an interesting look at how some one who originally wouldn't be considered crazy today was driven to semi insanity and a suicide attempt by an oppressive society. She didn't want to fit into the standard role expected of women at that time, for example, she tells a male character that she never wants to get married, to which he responds ,\\"You're crazy\\". She is later assualted and continually prohibited from doing what she wants because she is a woman, which is partially to blame for her break down."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The death of her father when she was only eight years old had a profound and terrible effect on Sylvia Plath. It was the dark star that ruled her life and led her to a period of insanity in her early twenties and eventually to suicide when she was thirty. All of this can be seen in her poems and in this thinly fictionalized autobiographical account of her mental illness. She likens the experience to being sealed in a bell jar, isolated from the world, her view of which becomes heavily distorted by the glass walls of her mental prison. She herself seems never to have faced up to the etiology of her neurosis and she does not describe her doctors as having discussed the issue, even though, after electroconvulsive therapy and (expensive) nursing care within an asylum eventually effected a cure of sorts (in reality, a temporary patching up), she describes herself as having been 'analyzed'.The Bell Jar is a painfully honest confessional that captures the characteristic self-absorption and craftiness of the mentally ill. She had considerable difficulty finding the right voice for this, her only novel, but finally hit on a sparse, fragmentary narrative style, embodying surreal poetic imagery, that is reminiscent of Salinger or Nathanael West. It is usually the girlish voice of the novel's protagonist rather than the mature voice of the author herself, with constant reference to hairstyles and shoes and of the unsatisfactory nature of the men in her life. Their real failure, of course, was in not being her father, and the threat they posed was that they would, as he had in a sense done, finally abandon her.Plath herself said that The Bell Jar could never be published in America, and when, after the author's death, it was, her mother tried to stop its publication. The characters and events were too thinly disguised for comfort. It remains, like most of her poems, a raw and open wound, a beautifully written and compelling narrative that has deservedly become a modern classic."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Are you the type of person that doesn't like to read that much? Do books bore you? Do you dread reading books assigned by your teachers at school? Is it hard for you to pick a book of your choice to read? If you answered yes to those questions, you might want to consider stopping by your local library or bookstore to purchase The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath. Though this book isn't a hot new release it's just as fresh as the books of today. It enters the mind of teenagers of today, which is good that teenagers are able to relate with the main character, Esther Greenwood. With all of the trials and tribulations that she goes through, it's almost a sure thing that readers could find at least one thing in common with her.The fact that the author continued page after page to throw all these problems at Esther could be considered an issue. Some reader's might think that maybe it was too much. Though if one were to see things in another light they could see it as the problems being stepping stones in life. Esther was climbing up but in reality she knew that sometimes you just have to start over for the best. Sylvia Plath proved in this book that you can fall rock bottom in your life and still be able to be on top once more."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"There are brief glimpses of brilliant writing in this book, but as a whole it is not consistently brilliant. What I am struck with the most is the utter selfishness of the author, the main character. For her to keep trying to kill herself simply because she is sated with life, out of sheer ennui from having been given too many opportunities in life, is galling. The author had some talent, but she had a lot more selfishness than talent. And she proved that when she later killed herself in real life. I'm sorry, but you DO NOT kill yourself after you've had children. Sorry, but once you have kids, the suicide option is out. Tell that to Kurt Cobain and Ian Curtis and any other self-centered artist: Try being a responsible human being for a change and quit thinking only about yourself so much."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Full, non-spoiler review courtesy at ~ Book & Movie Dimension a Blog ~The Bell Jar written by Sylvia Plath is a book that I'm very glad toward mt current Literature teacher for pushing me to read. It examines how too much pressure from society can a young woman. She spirals through a long journey through which realizes she has never done what she has wanted in life but what others wanted. This pushes her to descend into a dark abyss of painful despair. It is a sort of psychological classic type book. Sylvia Plath is remarked to have this book as her crowning achievement. She wrote some other books as welland tons of poetry. I'd say it is an ok book for those into this genre. I liked it but it isn't one of my favorites."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I had heard from a number of people that this was a book that was worth my time. It was a quick read, and it was pretty enjoyable. The description on the back cover of the book says it's about Plath's descent into insanity (&lt;-- not a direct quote). However, it wasn't much of a descent. It was more like, she wasn't insane at the end of one chapter, and at the beginning of another chapter she was suddenly insane.Regardless, it was a pretty good book. Not spectacular, but interesting enough to hold my attention."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Too bad, I was excited to read this book after reading a biography of her by Alexander_______. However, the book left me dissappointed. I could not understand anything; while reading, my mind kept wandering. That is a clear sign to me that the book could not grab my attention and it would be a waste of time to try to read the whole book. I just could not follow the writing at all. There was no plot, no flow that lead me from one event to the other.I read some of the other reviews from readers who also did not like the book. Some people felt that the book was too depressing and too self indulgent. That is the whole point of depression. Depression leads the mind inside oneself and finds fault with the world around it or finds fault about him or herself. It makes sense that her book shows the main character as someone who was self-absorbed. That's part of what depression is."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Although this book had some clever imagery and imaginative descriptions, the plot was almost non-existent. There is not one actual event throughout the novel. I could not empathise with the main character, but it did give me some insight into the minds of depressed people, because her life seemed to be one long, torturous toil, even though she really seemed to have no obvious reason for complaint. Even though the focus of the novel never strays from the main character, by the end of the novel, I barely felt I knew her at all; her depression seemed to consume any other personal qualities she may originally have had. As a fanatical reader, I felt I had to read it because it is a classic, but after doing so, I think it would have been best avoided."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Not sure if I like it or not.

Why are so many reviewers in love with this book? Is it because the author killed herself in real life? It certainly can't be the quality of the writing or story.

Well this is what happened here. Now I see why it wasn't going to be published when she was alive. Because it is BORING!(The book was published 6 weeks after Sylvia Plath committed suicide. Things always sell better after they are dead.) The entire first half of the book is so monotoned I found myself putting the book down quite often. I kept thinking \\"when will she go insane and be interesting?\\" I have to say that her description of things was intelligently written it was just so BORING!Let me sum the book up for you and save you the money....girl gets job in NY, girl meets boy, girl dumps boy, girl goes slightly insane, girl goes into a rehab/asylum, girl is up for getting out of the asylum, book ends......just like that!

Why? Because, gripping and chilling as it is, it offers no clear insight into why the woman was isolated, but leaves one with the feeling that it was the disease of society, the isolation of a weak person in the megalopolis. The evidence of her instability was not shown in the early part of the book, where she appeared 'normal' and then slipped into insanity."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Slyvia Plath's &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; was an amazing book that kept me reading till the end.

The one month in New York is where Esther starts to show her change. She returns home only to be commited to a santerium. Plath is an amazing writer and &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; proves this. I would recomend this book to anyone who is a fan of Plath's poetry, or to anyone who hasnt heard of her. It's definaly a book i will buy and read more than once."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I thought that the Bell Jar was a good book but was a little difficult to read and confusing at times. I think this is due to the fact that she herself is in a state of confusion. Although I do feel that this book would be helpful to those who are helping someone or themselves in dealing with suicide in their life and will help you to see some of the warning signs of suicide. The Bell Jar is a great book that shows first hand the emotions that a suicidal person goes through and what to do and also what not to do to help them."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I found the book a bit confusing as the scenes were so abrupt and short...giving the feeling of being &quot;disjointed&quot; from the book at every opportunity."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The book I thought was wonderful, but I had a question I had hoped someone could answer.

Thanks!"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Esther Greenwood is Sylvia Plath. Her slow descent into terrible crippling depression is boring but I think the point is, depression is painful but not exciting. Her mother wanted very much to help her troubled daughter but it was impossible to reach her. Esther/Sylvia was a brilliant girl with great intellect. That is also a point. Mental illness can affect the brightest people. Her reason for her crippling depression is unclear because no one knows that much about why some people fall into such hell with no reason to. Esther/Sylvia had great opportunities ahead of her. She had win literary prizes & also had VERY NICE BEAU WHO SINCERELY LOVED HER NONE OF THIS MATTERED.KNOWING WHAT EVENTUALLY BEFELL SYLVIA PLATH MAKES IT DOUBLY PAINFUL. I AM GLAD SHE DIDN'T DECIDE TO gas HER 2 sleeping CHILDREN with HER WHEN SHE STUCK HER HEAD IN the OVEN.A TRAGIC AFTERMATH IS THAT HER HUSBAND, TED HUGHES' SECOND WIFE, ALSO KILLED HERself plus their child! His third wife was a nurse (does that say something?). Hughes was the poet who was sort of the Queen Mother's poet laureate or I guess that means he wrote verse praising her.Because you know what eventually happens to Sylvia/Esther it makes the whole long tale more tragic. The story does become boring but the pain this poor girls suffered shouldn't be diminished because depression is boring. I can't say I enjoyed this book after the first 100 pages, it became more tedious but that is the point of her narrative Her life was depressing/tedious & she couldn't stop it."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The Bell Jar is a beautiful example of a classic, modern piece literature. The language is exquisite and the journey through the mind of Esther is completely engulfing. Sylvia Plath, in both her prose and poetry shows great insight into the human mind and demonstrates her true knowledge of the unstable person's mentality and recovery. The Bell Jar, like any great novel, questions and challenges the fabric of society and life itself.However, The Bell Jar can make even the most mentally stable person feel depressed and slightly suicidal. The entire novel deals with suicide: the road to Esther's breakdown, her week of attempting suicide and her years of recovery. When reading any work by Sylvia Plath, such as The Bell Jar or the poem Lady Lazarus, one must remember that Plath herself did end her life in suicide. For those with unstable tendencies or pessimistic views on life, The Bell Jar will only hinder growth and happiness.I will not be one to discourage people from reading the beautifully crafted novel that The Bell Jar is. My only recommendation is to choose a bright, happy day to undertake this novel as it will completely change your mentality, at least for the time in which you read it. Watch a happy movie, spend time with loved ones or read your favorite children's book (The Frog Princess) to restore your will to live after reading this novel. Until then, enjoy the disturbing masterpiece that Plath has created."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Plath's pseudo-autobiographical account, THE BELL JAR, is a striking novel rich in symbolism and marked with thematic relevance. Plath's main character, Esther Greenwood, a talented writer living in NYC and working for a fashion magazine, finds life as a female to be a terrific struggle of choosing between and conforming to the cookie-cutter &quot;good girl&quot; or &quot;bad girl&quot; roles of society. Consequently, Esther continuously references her inability to pick from the world's &quot;fig tree&quot; of female roles; she does not want to conform to ONE single role because she is diverse in both her thoughts and abilities. Plagued by her &quot;abnormal&quot; (as seen by society) desires for female equality, Plath loses her sense of identity and ends up in a mental institute attempting to overcome oppression from the conformity that she cannot defeat.Will Esther conquer or succumb to the pressures of life's &quot;bell jar&quot;? Only by reading this symbolic novel of self-discovery can one uncover Esther's true fate. Down-to-earth with real-life characters who suffer real-life problems, this novel proves to be a great read for anyone who is looking for lessons on how to prevent and/or overcome personal trials in life. Learning from the examples/mistakes of Esther, the reader grasps insight into life lessons throughout the novel. Skillfully incorporating various symbols and themes into the text, Plath engenders a literary masterpiece as well as work of art.Indeed, I am convinced that if a reader is willing to open up both his heart and his mind to the sensitive issues of this novel, he will not be let down."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I find this book almost the biography of Sylvia Plath. The protagonist,Esther Greenwood have numerous similarities to Plath. Reading this heart-breaking novel was a totally unforgettable experience.The book began with narration of Esther,19 and trying to write something in the summer in New York,1950. Esther like Plath was going through a difficult phase with life. She expereinced failures and distress and with unstable mind plus a little this and that lead to mental illness which eventually lead to suicide. Plath depicted the whole situation and events so vividly. Only one been through those thoughts and suffering could relate.Plath wrote it with so much empathy and conscientious. She was crying out for help to her mental unstableness and woe she was going through.Since this novel was published a month before her death at 30.Wonder how come no one approach to help her.If at that time she had care and support plus better treatment,maybe there's hope, or maybe not...."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The Bell Jar is a mysterious yet a lumionous novel. It starts off in New York City and takes us through Esther Greenwood's life. The novel is about the emotional problems that Esther faces in her young adulthood. Sylvia Plath takes the reader through a intertwining road and keeps the reader entertained at all times. The reader always is on the edge of his seat and always has the urge to read on. The creative writing syle that Plath uses is magnificent and unique. We have never come upon a novel so intriguing and extravegant. We recommend this novel to all readers who enjoy mysterious yet through-provoking stories. However, we do not recommend this novel to young teenagers. This book has the tendancy to explore areas that not many other novels have dared to do so."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The Bell Jar is a very great novel. It was written by Sylvia Plath, who is best recognized for her poetry. She committed suicide when she was thirty. The Bell Jar is not an autobiography, but there are some similarities to the author's life. The book is about a young girl named Esther, who is dealing with her mental illness. She has a severe mental breakdown and, eventually, she takes sleeping pills to attempt suicide. The major cause for Esther's breakdown is the lack of a clear individualized femal role. She feels that she is in a bell jar, stewing in her own foul air. However, the book ends on a hopeful note, as she enters for her conference with doctor.

Granted, but the only reason we were given horizons in this life, was to push those babies out...that's right expand 'em every chance you get. The Bell Jar did expand mine to some degree.The writing would probably reach out to a young adult more so than someone in mid-life, but it is solid throughout and tells the story of Plath's largely autobiographical descent into mental illness. Plath comes up with an apt metaphor for her condition, calling upon the strength of language she was bestowed with as a talented poet. The Ball Jar descends around her cutting her off from the &quot;normal&quot; world...it sets her apart, cuts off the air. I think Plath must not have been able to escape the Bell Jar in the end as a tragic suicide ended her gifted art early in 1963.It gives us hope today, that we have found better ways to deal with mental illness since those times and individual's stricken with a condition are allowed options and get the chance to chose life. I guess reading &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; at this stage of life did expand some horizons, but would probably reach out to those coming of age and let them know problems are out there, and they can be dealt with. I wouldn't call it an essential read for me, but it might be to others. Read Sylvia Plath for her poetry over her prose and study her life for a cautionary tale and appreciate what we have learned since then."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"a piece of litereature which evokes emotions and a thought process of an undescribable dimension."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I don't have much else to add to what the other reviewers have said, I just want to say that once you've read a book this compelling and complex it raises your standards for everything else you read.Give your self the gift of reading The Bell Jar."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I was hesitant to pick this up, but I am so glad I did. Plath beautifully wrote her story about a woman's undefinable mental battles combined with the demands of instant perfection from others (academically, socially, career-wise, and talent-wise), her own insecurities, and her own desires to be what she wanted on her own terms (something that didn't happen in her generation.) I could really relate to Esther in many ways, and I was swept away with the beauty in which it was written. It was interesting to be someone on the outside looking in on someone who was on the inside looking out. It was also interesting to get a glimpse of the struggle professional and intellectual women faced with the demands of 1950's housewife society.

I read it in an entire day & read it again. An interesting view on mental disorders in the 1950s, following the life and her perspectives starting from a summer working for a magazine through the mental institution. The way Plath writes is unique, and I re-read several passages so intrigued by the cleverness on how it's written. I plan to purchase more of Plath's books now."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"There are a lot of books out there (and movies, and TV specials, etc.) about depression, but too often I feel the disorder is glamorized into some kind of melancholic artistic reverie. \\"The Bell Jar\\" is not one of those books.From the start, the narrator is believable and even likeable. Plath, writing form her own experiences with breakdowns and hospitalization, creates a fully developed and complex, even at times humorous character to whom I could relate. The story moves along well, doesn't sag, and the ending, though ambiguous, makes the story all the more realistic--there is no definitive end to depression, and the story mirrors that well.As always, I appreciated the fact that it was not a feel-good book; Plath is not one given to sappy interludes and touchy-feely sessions between the characters. It's spare, yet it resonates with human feeling and human frustration."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"An amazing book, which opens your eyes to how mental illness creeps up and affects everyone. A must read."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This book is not so much about plot as it is about character. That's my humble opinion.Plath's character Esther is the focal point of the story. It is told by her point of view. The book details her descent from a editorial prize from a famous magazine to her fall to a mental institution.The book works on many level. Any girl, in fact, anyone can relate to Esther's fall to depression because everyone has, once in their life, had a moment of depression or loneliness or isolation, etc.In fact, I'm sure, many of you know that this book semi-autobiographical of Plath's own life.And I'm sure many of you know the comparison to Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye to this book. But it is different, though I give both of them 4 stars. It's different while Holden deals with his contempt for human behavior, this is more of a detail description of a person's fall to depression.The fact is Esther could be anyone. This book is a quick read and worth the effort. If you have time, it won't take you more than two days.The reason I gave this book four stars is because I, myself, could not relate to the main character. Throughout the novel, I felt myself pitting her. It's not the book, it really is me. That's the main weakness of the story. While most people are use to the main character triumphing at the end, there is none of this. Depression isn't an easy battle to win and the book leaves us kind of empty. The author loathing for herself is overwhelming. Everyone has their moments, but very few of us are completely absorb by it."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"That word, &quot;factitious,&quot; according to Sylvia Plath, was used by one of her creative writing professors to characterize one of her submissions, &quot;The big weekend.&quot; I doubt he would read anything &quot;factitious&quot; into The Bell Jar. If anything, Ms. Plath takes pains to ensure that readers understand the depth of her psychological pain in a prose that can be vivid, even stunning. My one problem is that her own self-loathing overwhelms all else; by the novel's end, her biting sarcasm and stubborn bitterness had begun to grate. Still, there is no doubt that she demonstrates in this book the mastery of her craft, a mastery even more apparent in her poetry. I strongly recommend this novel; both its weakness and its extrodinary strengths are instructive. What a loss she was..."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This is a lovely book. It's a bit disturbing at some parts, but being a teenage girl, I can relate to some of her thoughts. This is a book that makes you think. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The Bell Jar is a hard book to read. In reading it, I felt like I was trapped in Esther's bell jar myself. Her words, so achingly real--almost certainly related to the book's semi-autobiographical nature--evoke the struggles of not only women but also any overachiever and any loner. Throughout the novel, we see how the bell jar encaged Esther and we see how slowly, very slowly, she lifts it off of herself.I think the reason I appreciated this book so much is that the problems Esther faced are problems I've faced, and although I'm better than Esther, I've felt so low sometimes I felt like breaking. She showed me that she wasn't crazy; there was nothing wrong with her besides these social circumstances that she just couldn't cope with, try as she might. I love reading books where I feel like the narrator expresses my thoughts in a more tangible and eloquent way (and Plath can write!) The only reason it wasn't perfect for me--although this rating may change upon more reflection--was that mental illness is, well, pretty boring. The repeated suicide attempts and the monotony of life in the asylums are not particularly gripping, but I understand their necessity to the story.I just wish I could read this story with Esther walking into her final interview with the psychiatrists and walking out of the bell jar, however, it is impossible to read that last page and then not remember Plath's suicide shortly after this book's publication. Because of this knowledge, instead of ending with a sense of hope, the book ends with the feeling that bell jar is forever, it always exists, floating right above our heads, ready to collapse upon us again."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"One of those classic reads that you want to pick up when you are alone and have time to savor each word. Chosen by our book club, this goes on the list as one of the best written books I have ever read and provides a vast arena of discussion for our next meeting. Plath gives the reader an inside seat in the world of mental illness/depression and the struggles therein. Dark, but the author uses superb imagery and takes you along on this woman's struggle for sanity/reason. Excellent!"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Hmmm...How does one read or review Plath when her ghost so obviously lurks in every corner? Plath as the proto-feminist... Plath as the tortured artist... Plath as the avatar of mental illness... Mostly, though, Plath as the emotive symbol for the unbearable pressure of potential.I can't believe I went so long avoiding this book. Maybe so many of us get turned off to her work by all the Sylvias we go to school with and come across at poetry readings through the years. I was wrong to ignore the work this long or judge it by her fans.I haven't been as excited about words in a very long time. I don't think she is much of a storyteller or novelist, in the sense that I use those words usually, but I think her language might rival Marquez or Fitzgerald at their best.I do not often read such clear and perfect descriptive passages and she seems an inexhaustible well of them and avoids falling into the faults of Faulkner in the rush to be \\"literary\\".While the theme of this book and its obvious and melancholy parallel to her own demise is hard to bear at times, she is such a masterful writer, it is, in the end, impossible to put down."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Read a library copy of Bell Jar and had to have it. It felt like I was side by side with her, all the way down. It seemed so clear what she was saying, it was spooky. Now I can re-read the book and notate on every page. Books I REALLY like I must write in. Feels like I know her. I always want to understand, or try to, the mental and emotional trials of struggling, highly intelligent individuals. Bell Jar is on the list, and not overwhelming. On the way to Infinite Jest."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The Bell Jar was a pleasure to read. It is deeply personal as it described the (fairly rapid) rise of mental disease and the sink into depression. The prose was lovely to read, and the word choice is quite appropriate. I can identify with many parts of Esther's thoughts and life. The novel itself is so engrossing and, above all, real. I did not doubt any of the things that happened. I did not find myself thinking, \\"Wait... That's kind of unlikely\\" once. The circumstances and situations were entirely believable. Overall, a work of art."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"When I first read this book about 15 years ago, I was expecting a downright depressing story of a young woman's descent into madness. Instead, I got an often hilarious telling of what it's like to be such a brilliant and insightful woman with a brain chemistry problem. Sometimes, I almost fell out of bed laughing at Esther's perceptions and reactions to her situation. True, certain parts are downright horrific and devastating; but I still felt that Slyvia Plath had created an \\"Essential\\" novel for everyone to read."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Of all things that impressed me most about this book, it's the way the narration of Esther changes with her mental state. In the beginning, she tells you everything that she is doing and how she feels about it, but it's detached. As she spirals down, you see makes no attempt to explain her thought process because to a person suffering from that type of mental breakdown, it all seems normal so there would be no need to explain. In the end, as she recovers, the things she thinks about, they become real as she's reconnected with her old self, her healthy self. It's beautifully written, even if the physical descriptions are sometimes overkill. This story will stay with you for a while.-- Emma D, aka Anna Zimmerman"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Book is in pretty good condition and I was please to get it in the mail, I actually had forgotten that I ordered it seems it took a long time to arrive- worth the wait.

It is the poignant story of a brilliant woman, Esther, who is trapped between the worlds of the sexist 50s and academia/career. This struggle leads to her slow demise into mental illness. I urge all young women to read this book.

However, that label is a huge insult to the Bell Jar and Sylvia Plath who has ten times the skill of salinger and her book is ten times more real and more intresting. Despite the differences, this book shares one fault with salingers in that both rely heavily on a main character, Holden and in Plath, Esther. So if you find your self hating Esther, than you probably won't like any of the book. That said, Plath makes Esther much more appealing and likeable than holden, most likely because the character is more genuine than Holden Caufield. The story itself gave me the chills at the end, which is ironic, though it was not intended to be so and that is what gets you while you read the book: The fact that she worked so hard battling depression only to fall back under the bell jar shortly after the book was published. However, as one reviewer earlier suggested, this book is more than a descent into madness, it also makes social commentary on the role of woman and the suburban life, i can't find that review now but it was really excellent you should look through and find it."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I read The Bell Jar for a research paper on Sylvia Plath. As I researched info on her life, I was amazed at the events that happened to her that ended up in the novel. The first part of the novel is very funny. The humor slows down at the climax, and stays there for a bit during the conclusion. However, by the end of the book, I felt that I had read everything that was happening before. It was a lot like Girl, Interrupted's hospital, and I realize that this book was the forerunner for these psychological memoirs."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This is a very pointed look at a young woman's descent into psychosis. Plath is a blunt author and there are many questions as to if this book is an autobiography. The main character, Esther, uses many aliases (aliai?) and tells a story that lines up quite well with that of Mrs.Plath. This was a required reading book this year at school for me, but I will tell you this. I read it over the summer and liked it-but I enjoyed it more this time around. This is a powerful book and is written with a lot of well thought out imagery and symbolism. If you have seen the movie Girl, Interupted or read One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest you will find this book of interest. But if you have a light stomach beware in the last three or so chapters. One of my all time favorites!"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The Bell Jar would have to be one of the most wonderful books I have read yet. I find myself feeling the same way &quot;esther&quot; did in the book seeing that I am also a 19 year old college student who writes poetry and stories trying to find ways to show the world my work. It shows the darkness behind the sugar coating that society has painted for youth today. We are told that we have it easy and that we should be more thankful and in The Bell Jar it shows that life isn't as easy for youth as we are told it is. It shows that success is not always a great thing to have. It can bring you down faster than it brought you up. This is a great book and I recommend it to anyone. It's partially autobiographical and I recommend also reading &quot;Letters Home&quot; by Plath's mother. It has letters that Sylvia wrote to her mother throughout her life and it gives much more depth to The Bell Jar."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I picked up this book on a lark and could not put it down. The dipiction of ester's decent and how she rose again kept me entralled to the very core. to read how she struggle and to dee how her life was touched me. Ester forced her readers to look inside themselves and made it clear that you are not to be afriad or look down on the characters in this book. Everyone of them had a reason and a purpose to complete and I would defnitly recoment that if you are looking for a good pice to read that Slyvia Platt is the way to go."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This is a novel that chronicles a young woman's downward spiral into depression and an eventual suicide attempt. It is a thin veiling of Sylvia Plath's own history. Sadly later on she succeeded.With this in mind from the first chapter it is easy to see that the author felt separate from her \\"healthy\\" counterparts. I think most of us feel that at some time, however her disassociation became more complete. I was wishing, I had had a sense of what she was like before this began. Was this an extreme change or did she often feel set apart, when she was technically healthy.What is frightening about this book is that while you are in her head with the writing, none of her thoughts or feelings seem so outrageous. In the afterward it indicated she pondered rewriting the whole story from the outside perspective, from her mother and associate's point of view. There were some references that were startling, as the not changing clothes and bathing that were not apparent to the reader that she adds in occasionally. This gives you a sense of a disconnect between the inside and the outside that she was feeling. This outside perspective would have added much to understanding the why for her mother's first suggestion to seeing a doctor, as from \\"Esther's\\" view this seemed unnecessary. Ironically, the character never really questioned the need for either the doctor's visit or the electroshock therapy. This shows the character's ability to comply, regardless of how she felt. Authority and other's measurements of her, as most good student's played a very strong part in her personality.Later on, when she is recovering in the asylum, her relations with other people improve, however, she does not appear to the reader to be so different in thought. It appears that the measurement of success is entirely based on the patient's relation to the outside world. As there were no more references to poor hygiene or suicidal thought, this apparently was the mark of wellness. From the reader's perspective this does not necessarily make the transition from a lack of mental health to one that is acceptable, so obvious. It also apparently does not give the patient a framework to work with. This is evident by the fact that she did go on to successfully commit suicide years later.This is a coming of age story that many people have faced in one sense, though not to that extreme, when they get to an age of moving from the teenage world to that of an adult. Often this is triggered by moving from the academic setting to that of the working world. There a disconnect that happens there. The high achieving student that Sylvia Plath was, was apparently unprepared for the shift in priorities that happens during this shift. She lost her footing and until her behavior became extreme, no one noticed..As this is the second time I read this book, it is evident, I hold it in high regard. It is easy to empathize with the character of Esther and her dilemma's. In some ways too easy. I think most of us when we are troubled disassociate ourselves with the world around us and become very egocentric. This book may serve as blue print for testing yourself to see how well you are doing. I also think this is a good book for young people at this stage to read. It will give them some sense that someone has been there and done that and maybe it can get them to ask for help before they get to the point she did."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Plath's story may leave you with the sense that a sane and healthy mind is much more of a fragile thing than you expected. By turns entertaining, funny, dark, and poetic; Plath's writing infuses her character with genuine humanity. She allows us a unique insight into an unwell mind. Strangely enough, I often found myself cracking a slow smile as I read the thoughts of a completely rational character whose descent into insanity seemed so natural and reasonable."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Despite my penchant for both women's literature and modern American literature, and despite the fact that I even majored in American Literature in college, I never got around to reading this book. I so loved Plath's poetry, particularly in college, that I think I was secretly frightened to read her autobiography because it would force me to think carefully about her tragic end. Now that I've finally finished it, I can count it among my favorite novels. Its colloquial and simple language makes it an easy read. Esther's deep struggles with the opportunities both open and closed to women are as accurate and pertinent today as they were 30 or 40 years ago, and Plath's riveting and terrifying description of a young girl's plunge into mental illness is crafted with such ease that the reader begins to question her own sanity. The real tragedy of the novel is knowing the true end of Plath, and thinking how much more wonderful prose and poetry she could have contributed."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"\\"The Bell Jar\\" by Silvia Plath, is a book about a girl named Esther Greenwood. She begins to go crazy after she returns home to Boston, from her summer job in New York. She finds that unreality is taking over her life. She makes several suicide attempts and is taken to a mental hospital to be treated.I would highly reccommend \\"The Bell Jar\\". The author writes in an excellent style that makes Esther Greenwood's insanity seem so real. This is a tragic but wonderful and interesting book of how Esther lives her life with her insanity. She undergoes shock treatments at a mental hospital, but along the way, she meets new people and recalls back on some past experiences. I can guarantee that anyone who reads this book will love it just as I did, and will not be dissappointed."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This is my favorite book of all time, and contrary to popular belief, Sylvia Plath is not crazy; she is simply honest. Any teen, adolscent or post-adolscent girl can identity with Esther's plight because it is their own, and anyone who says otherwise is a liar. Plath's novel takes you places where you may not want to go; but, they are places where every woman has been before at some point in her life. Even if you've never been haunted by the prospect of suicide, you know how it feels to have life close in, leading you to toy with the idea of crawling under a rock and quickly disappearing from the rest of the world. You know what it's like to be afraid of living because one more day in the world is one more day you have to deal with an overbearing mother, a snoopy peer or a demanding boyfriend. Every girl gets trapped in her own private bell jar. Esther goes through all these things and any woman can easily relate, whether she wants to admit it or not. I must say that this is far and away the most bare and honest novel I have ever read. I could almost hear the wheels of psychosis churning around and around in Esther's head. Plath is a genius and expresses her brilliance ever so beautifully in this masterpiece of hers. FIVE BRIGHT GLEAMING STARS! A MUST READ FOR WOMEN EVERYWHERE!"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The Bell Jar is a stark narrative about depression, and the power it has to completely immobilize protagonist Esther Greenwood and throw her into insanity. The Bell Jar's prose is easy to read, and yet Sylvia Plath's writing style is highly sophisticated and exact, which is startling considering the nearness of her own suicide. Esther Greenwood begins an ambitious and talented young writer, working for a beauty magazine in New York, and attending college on a full scholarship. Her sorrow and madness begin to surface, and she soon finds herself trapped in a revolving door of mental asylums. The interesting thing here is way the story is told; unflinchingly and without remorse. I could hear Plath's cold, spare, incisive voice behind that of Miss Greenwood - hurting and ready to die. The Bell Jar can be read as a fierce indictment on depression. It is a brilliant, haunting, frightening work, and it held my interest intensely the whole way through."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"No matter your age or background, if you have ever felt alone, you can relate to this book. The Bell Jar is the story of a girl fresh out of college trying to find peace of mind and happiness. The beginning of the book tells of her slow discovery that everything she has ever wanted-and is now on the verge of getting-do not mean as much as she thought. As her dreams seem to crash down around her, she feels her bell jar descend, sending her into a state of loneliness and madness. The beauty of The Bell Jar is that the author's feelings come through so honestly that the reader feels like he or she is sitting across from a friend, listening to their story. The story not only draws sympathy from the reader, but causes an assessment of one's own dreams and fears. The Bell Jar is not a story to read and forget. It mirrors real life inner-quarrels and leaves the reader with a sense of hope. No matter what the bell jar is, it can be overcome."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This novel is fascinating because it is not driven by the usual plot devices writers use to move a story along. The reader is sucked into this book by Sylvia Plath's exquisite narrative voice: her similies are still startling even after so many years, her word choices are flawless, and she is a master at choosing just the right details-- and nothing more to bog down the narrative flow-- that illuminate a scene.The plot has a true ring to me. I suspect that most people who have made it through most of a college program, and must confront the courses and people which they have managed to avoid for many semesters; that, or not finish their program, would feel the same way. I don't think a person must be depressive in order to relate to the malaise of the beginning of the book. By the time things become, well...strange, the reader has already been pulled into Esther's head, and sees events from her perspective. Her depression seems almost inevitable.Beautiful and perfect."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The story can be compared to Catcher In The Rye in that the main characters of both stories are similarly out of place in society. They feel as though there is something in life that is missing, but continue living not knowing what it is until they eventually have a mental breakdown. Sylvia Plath, however, writes in a much more poetic language than Salinger. Her words could be violently beautiful, or peacefully bloody, but what can one expect from a novel by a poet."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Rarely, if ever do I give a book 5 stars, but this definitely deserved it. I was up until the wee hours in the morning reading this book. In this semi-autobigraphical account of Plath's own life, we follow Esther as she slowly sinks in the clutches of &quot;insanity&quot;. I especially liked the first person narration of the story; it provided a more personal view on Esther's fall into insanity. When I was reading it, I could feel and understand Esther's concerns with herself and the people/world around her.I've noticed that most of the time when people talk about this book, they speak of only Esther's insanity and how it relates to Plath's own diminishing state of mind, but in my opnion, there's so much more to it than that. I actually think that in a small sense the story was also about the problems of the world through Esther's eyes. Take for instance Buddy's betrayal. This makes Esther question all those theories about men and women being pure for their husbands and wives. Yes, a large part of this story is about Esther's mental state, but at the same time, you're faced with a young woman who is aptly aware of her surroundings. She questions the standard? What's right? What's wrong?This is definitely a book worth checking out and adding to your library."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This is the first and last novel of Sylvia Plath and a permanent indention in the literary world. The story begins with the awakening of a young Esther Greenwood to her own uniqueness and eventually the self-awareness that drove her mad. She realizes that she is alone in the world and that there was no one that in any way resembled herself. She shares her innermost thoughts of those around her:&quot;The figures around me weren't people, but shop dummies, painted to resemble people and propped up in attitudes counterfeiting life.&quot; She also reflects with her own difficulties with the prospects of love.&quot;And I knew that in spite of all the roses and kisses and restrauraunt dinners a man showered on a woman before he married her, what she secretly wanted when the wedding service ended was for her to flatten out underneath his feet like Mrs. Willard's kitchen mat. What a man wants is a mate and what a woman wants is infinite security, and, what a man is is an arrow into the future and what a woman is is the place the arrow shoots off from.&quot; This story was the self-prophecy of Sylvia Plath and allows us to travel on her potent emotionally wrenching journey."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I think more than anything else, The Bell Jar is a book about uncertainty and failure. Like the main character, when I first entered college, I thought that anyone who encounters these two horrific obstacles is stuck forever in a trap, and nothing short of a flawless record is ever worthy of existence. I didn't realize that if you live long enough, you're certain to encounter such setbacks, and if you live even longer, you're certain to get through them as well.The actual book title is a bit puzzling initially, but it ties in really well with the story and this theme about life being full of times when you're imprisoned in an incredible streak of depressing, non-successful ventures. Even something as simple as sleep becomes a struggle to accomplish. It's like the hand of God has abandoned you, and you just have to wait for it to come back.The modernized world has great expectations of us all, and we have great expectations of the modernized world. But sooner or later, both parties will fall short of these expectations. We expect to have no problems getting through school, succeeding in a career, finding love, and starting a family. We don't expect setbacks and failures such as divorce, suicide, inadequate talent, infidelity, car accidents, miscarriages, and bad economic times to play enough of a factor to damage our plans. And the world doesn't expect us to fall into these things. But in truth, none of us is above a single one of these failures falling upon us.ABC's \\"How To Be A Millionaire\\" sums up a good portion of The Bell Jar for me in the statement, \\"I've seen the future. I can't afford it.\\" It's a statement I agree with. Despite our expectations, we can't afford the future. But somehow, miraculously, with a lot of hope and a lot of help, there just may be a way to get through it. So believe it or not, The Bell Jar leaves me with a strong feeling of optimism, at this, the closing of the year."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The Bell Jar is the loosely autobiographical novel by Sylvia Plath. It's one of my favorite books. I could read it repeatedly, and that's not something I normally do with most novels. Unquestionably, Sylvia Plath was one of the greatest literary talents of the 20th century. Just from reading this novel, you can tell she is a poet at heart. The book is simpler and more straightforward than her poetry (which is to be expected), but she draws you in as the reader with her various uses of simile and her striking imagery. The prose has an intensity, as well has a conversational tone, that makes it feels as if Esther Greenwood is speaking directly to you, making it hard to put down.Despite its reputation in some circles as a \\"feminist\\" novel, young men and women should be able to read this book and find something to relate to. Not only does Esther struggle with society's sexist double standards, she is also striving to find her place in the world, establish a career, carve out an identity for herself. This is a must read for anyone in their young adulthood because who doesn't deal with those existential dilemmas during that time? This book is also well known for focusing on depression. Plath makes you understand the illness completely through Esther's eyes, to the point that that it's difficult to determine what is actually wrong with her. The subject matter may keep some people away but Plath's hilariously sardonic sense of humor provides great comic relief throughout the entire novel (even throughout the heavier second half). Plath's reputation often precedes her work so I would recommend not going into the novel with any preconceived notions and simply treasuring its brilliance."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Probably the thing that scares me the most about this book is how much I relate to Esther, the brilliantly mad heroine. Of course, it's not her brilliance to which I relate, but her madness. Sylvia Plath indeed makes Esther's breakdown seem like the most reasonable thing in the world. Esther is battered left and right by people's expectations of her, as a woman and as a writer. All of these expectations are burdens, weighing her down until she finally falls into a dark hole. It's 1953, and for a woman who wants to define her life by her work and her mind, the pressures of marriage and womanhood are immense. Esther is surrounded by talented girls who want nothing more than a rich husband and children. Esther doesn't fit into that mold, and she is unable to create her own.Sylvia Plath uses the story of a fig tree to illustrate how Esther sees the many different possible paths in her life. One fig is the talented poet, another is the doting wife and mother, and another is the powerful editor....it goes on and on. Many people have struggled with the same thing. Esther feels pulled in many different directions (as do I). Her descent into madness throws a wrench into her plans, forcing her to deal with the imperfect person she really is. Plath uses an almost causal tone when describing Esther's breakdown. Everything is stated matter-of-factly, demonstrating how even the mentally ill can think rationally.The book deserves its place among the best of the American classics. Plath was a literary genius whose own struggles with mental illness gave her poetry and prose a tragic and haunting voice."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Flat out one of the best novels I've ever read. I've read her poems before and never really cared for them. I'm going to go back and read a few now that I have a perspective on who she was.I saw one reviewer say he/she didn't understand how people found this novel thought provoking or moving. Well, I wouldn't consider it either one for me. What I did find was a candid story about a deeply troubled teenage girl in the first half of the twentieth century.This should be on high school reading lists long before Tolstoy's eloquent yet stale Anna Karenina.. just to name one off the top of my head."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Sylvia Plath's semi-autobiographical novel begins the first half with an uncannily similar introspective caustic awareness of Holden Caulfield -The Catcher in the Rye- and ends with a tranquil and disturbingly pathetic prisoner of mental illness who resembles Susanna Kaysen -Girl, Interrupted.The beginning accounts for a young talented writer who wins an award in college to work for a fortnight in New York and hob nob with literary greats while witnessing the operations of a media magazine mogul. Life was free and very good to the protagonist - Esther Greenwood.Then Esther shrinks and defies comradery and eerily succumbs to a mental illness that most cannot relate to - as most are lucky enough to be immune to such disease. And, to Plath's credit, Esther does not deliver an account pleading for your sympathy. Instead, Plath describes in the first person what she perceives - awkward to the sane reader, but amazingly enlightening.Malcolm Lowery won great praise for his dipsomaniac's perspective inUnder the Volcano- where words plastered on the beginning pages read as though the typist either could not formulate a sentence, or was as impaired as the protagonist. By reading pages of the blundering but decipherable prose, Lowery made the reader feel the torment of the drunkard's demise. In this book, where the prose is not nearly as difficult as that by Lowery (in fact the writing is exceptionally good), the reader is taken to experience what Plath calls the Bell Jar. This book teaches without being didactic.Before reading this novel, I fondly looked upon bell jars - the glass covers used to protect flowers. They tickled pleasant and fond memories of nature and its beauty. But, to Plath, a bell jar is something much more than a cover to adorn. Even if she received the greatest gift from anyone, she writes that she could not appreciate it as \\". . . I would be sitting under the same glass bell jar, stewing in my own sour air.\\" And this haunting life discouraged her and made her want to avoid becoming a fusty old mare. She continually would worry because \\". . . I wasn't sure . . . [that] somewhere, anywhere - the bell jar , with its stifling distortions. . . wouldn't descend again. . .\\" And, in real life they did.Not hidden amid this novel are feminist tones - not undertones. Great details about not marrying, not having children, and fighting men who almost rape good girls like Esther to do the \\"act\\" exist in this book. And, in the end after having virgin-ending sex, she experiences what the doctor says \\"only one in a million\\" experience - severe unending hemorrhaging. Men are not good for much - even in that respect.Having lived in the novel's backdrop, and being an avid lover of J.D. Salinger's deprecating words in young man's jargon about the privileged of New York, I felt shrouded in nostalgia when reading this novel. This book brought me to places and literature I admire. This book took me back in time in a comfortable way - irrespective of the topic which I rarely include in conversation or thought. Plath is, in my biased opinion, as important a voice of the early sixties as those who preceded her by only a matter of few years - theBeat Generation.This novel deserves its praise, and it is certainly our misfortune that the author died at a young age with only one published novel."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"In The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath,Esther Greenwood shares her most significant years of adulthood with thereader and gives an insightful perspective on life as she descends into madnessand finds her life put on hold for a mental illness that won't let her returnto her old life of academic excellence and writing. She didn't find herselfstimulated by the high-end parties of New York City's glamorous culture andthe idolized lifestyle that other girls her age strove to achieve, but herexperiences frightened and disoriented her. Esther becomes increasinglydepressed, and finds herself unable to sleep, write, eat or behave normally. Shechecks into different institutions to help herovercome her illness and sheprogressively (with highs and lows) tries to return to sanity.Plath's distinctive writing is a verbal feast with vivid imagery, accuratediction, and original comparisons. Overall an enjoyable read, regardless of someof the grim circumstances that Esther finds herself in (The Bell Jar is reallya thinly veiled autobiography of Sylvia Plath). It's unforgettable darkand cynical humor as well as the thought provoking themes makes it well worththe read.(Anna Kogan)"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"As many other reviewers have stated, this book is filled with poetry.

In High School I was required to Read \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" several times. Never once was this book even suggested. I have always enjoyed CITR, and have read it many times both for pleasure and requirement. I had heard of Plath, but had no idea that she wrote such a book.

Early on, she declares, (p 2) \\"I was supposed to be having the time of my life.\\" Esther Greenwood and eleven other young ladies (p 3) \\"had all won a fashion magazine contest, by writing essays and stories and poems and fashion blurbs, and as prizes they gave us jobs in New York for a month, expenses paid, and piles and piles of free bonuses, like ballet tickets and passes to fashion shows...\\" Unfortunately, instead of elation and excitement at such an opportunity, of it, she writes (p 3) \\"I felt very still and very empty, the way the eye of a tornado must feel, moving dully along in the middle of the surrounding hullabaloo.\\"The Bell Jar follows her experiences as an intern in NYC during the early 1950s, college life (dating, avoiding her TB afflicted boyfriend, trying to lose her virginity), and mental decline, including time spent in a psych ward for electroshock therapy. This semi-autobiographical novel, filled with telling statements about her mental state; (p 71) \\"I was only truly happy until I was nine years old,\\" (p 15) \\"I felt like a hole in the ground,\\" (p 57) \\"I felt dull and flat and full of shattered visions,\\" (p 81) \\"I began to think maybe it was true that when you were married and had children it was like being brainwashed, and afterwards you went about numb as a slave in some private, totalitarian state,\\" (p 109) \\"A summer calm laid its soothing hand over everything, like death,\\" and (p 151) \\"If you were going to kill yourself, how would you do it?\\" is a terrific, telling trip down lunacy lane. Also good: Girl Interrupted by Susanna Kaysen, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey, and A Beautiful Mind by Sylvia Nasar."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The Bell Jar tells the captivating story of Esther Greenwood, a gifted young woman who has just completed her arduous internship as a junior editor at a magazine in New York City in the early 1950s. The novel, written entirely in first person, chronicles her mental breakdown and subsequent emotional deterioration.This work is a roman &agrave; clef, in which some or all of the characters in the book are based on actual people, and the happenings in the novel are rooted in real occurrences. Typically this style is used on sensitive subjects, or subjects with which the author is not entirely comfortable revealing all the information. This novel was obviously quite emotionally close to Plath, who could be described as the real-life Esther Greenwood. Originally released under the pen name Victoria Lucas, the book was modified to be in Sylvia Plath's name only after her suicide in 1971.Though often associated with severe sadness or depression, The Bell Jar can be very humorous, but not always in an obvious way. Plath writes using dry humor, being, at times, extremely cynical. She expresses a strong disdain for those who choose to follow convention, such as marrying and having children, believing those to be unexceptional and simple paths of life.Plath's skill is unmistakable and her experience as a poet is quite evident. Alliteration and assonance are scattered in the pages of The Bell Jar, and Plath employs various other literary devices throughout the novel to enrich the reading experience. Symbolism is another tool commonly used by the author. Esther glimpses into several mirrors during her stay at the psychiatric ward, often mistaking her reflection for that of another. This lack of self-recognition reveals Esther's struggle to fully comprehend herself and this symbolism demonstrates Plath's insight into the human condition.To be direct, I adore this book. I find the character Esther to be the perfect combination of skepticism and wit, refusing to conform to meet the standards of her time. Her resilience and individuality ripple forth from the pages of this book like the interruption of still water by a stone.Having said all of this, I probably would not recommend The Bell Jar. I say this not because of any fault of the book, but for my own selfish reasons. As it is, I feel not everyone has the capacity to genuinely appreciate this bok. Reading this novel without that capacity runs the risk of depreciating it based on misunderstanding. In a way, those who choose to pursue this piece of literature deserve the knowledge it holds, and this prevents the book from becoming commonplace. It should be kept-- like a secret among friends."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Reading The Bell Jar, I have uncomfortable moments where I see whispers of Esther's insanity in myself. Plath has created a character (or maybe recorded herself in a way) that is eminently believable, and begins the book with a personality that doesn't hint at what is to come later. Her apathy and distraction grow so gradually, normality and madness blend into each other so finely, that it is disconcertingly jarring to realize how hazy and meaningless the word \\"normal\\" really is. For some reason we seem to expect that we would know insanity instantly were we to see it, or experience it, ourselves. But of course the difference between a \\"normal\\" person and a person suffering from a mental disorder is a construct of our society, not an immutable distinction. This book is beautifully written, with many scenes that linger in my memory. It ends ambiguously, but the sad story of its author gives the entire work a somber feel."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"When you first read this book, it hits you like nothing has hit you before.

It was assigned for English Class Summer reading. Yahoo.BUt I tell you truly, it was worth it. I've never read something that so vividly puts across the feeling one must have in Ester's situation.

A good read that, while sometimes tedious, is definitely worth the time."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This story was well-written and I could totally relate with Esther. Plath is excellent at writing in the way that we think inside of our heads. The only reason I chose not to give the story five stars is that the ending was weak and lacked closure.

Highly reccomended!"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Many things fascinated me about The Bell Jar. One is that I knew the story of Sylvia Plath's suicide before I read it, so I knew I was not merely reading a story. I was reading Sylvia Plath's own deepest fears and ambitions and joys, many of which I could relate to. It is fascinating how seemlessly her writing flows from her sanity to insanity in a way in which you can barely tell when the change began. It is almost eery (and a bit frightening) when you realize how many moments in Esther's life you can completely relate with emotionally. And finally, it was fascinating to learn from her story, how a seemingly normal person's mental stability can be so fragile and unreliable. I will never forget this book as long as I live, and recommend it with all my heart.

It wasn't until I checked out a copy of The Bell Jar that I began to feel less lonely. All the technical information I found in the journals was nothing compared to Plath's portrait of depression. She does not give lists of the symptoms of depression; instead, I felt clear recognition of the feelings Esther was experiencing. I recommend this book to anyone experiencing depression who needs to feel that they are not alone."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I would like to start off by saying that \\"The Bell Jar\\" by Sylvia Plath is a very interesting, creative, humorous, and splendid book. It gets off to a slow start but, its gets a lot better! It can be confusing at some points because it goes into flashbacks many, many times. Also, the vocabulary of the narrator can be confusing too. It is mainly told in first person. The main characters name is Esther. She goes through many struggles including love, trying to fit in, mental illness, and depression. I would say that the reading level is high school, college, and up.Once you start reading it, you can not stop!"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Sylvia Plath did such a wonderful job writing this novel about the psycic breakdown of a woman. Unfortunately Plath's life would slightly mimick the character in the book. But, though its horrible to say this, Plath's own mental breakdown made this book so good and realistic. As thoughts poor threw Esther's mind, it's so vivid and realistic it's almost scarry. Esther had a horrible life being thrown from one mental intistuition to the next and this novel makes certain that the reader feels the majority of the emotions Esther feel herself. Fear, anticipation, sadness, confusion, all poor through your mind through reading this book just as they do for Esther. This is a sad novel that will make you think."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The Bell Jar is a book that came to me via a monologue I once heard given by the character Chris Stevens of Northern Exposure fame. I don't remember the context, nor the message, nor even the general idea of what was said. All I remember was the name of the author, and the name of the book. It stuck with me for a long time, and finally it bubbled up and found its way to my book pile. Eventually, it got read.Now that you know the story of my coming upon The Bell Jar, I suppose it would be appropriate to give a reasonable explanation of what I thought of it. Having bridged the subject, I find it difficult to do. The book is easy to read, probably taking me 4 days of sporadic reading to finish it. Be warned though, the book is certainly not light reading material.The subject matter is dark, in the realm of a more mature I Am The Cheese or The Chocolate War. I felt a lot of resonance between those Robert Cormier books and this by Sylvia Plath. I hated Cormier's books - the same cannot be said of this. While I did find it difficult material, it was not inherently cruel. It was troubling, yet truthful throughout. The struggle that Platt endures is tough reading, especially when you know this is a real story. Granted it was told through her looking glass, so you have to take that into consideration. Still, it's pretty dramatic no matter what your perspective.The chapter at the end of the book I read was an additional biographical note by Lois Ames, and in it we find a little of what happened to Plath after the book ends. It brings things together, in a sense. In a very real way it comes as no surprise to read those pages. I'll leave it at that, since there is already too much between the lines for the unknowing reader to glean from.In a strange way this book is a modern classic. It will likely not sit on the pedestal that The Good Earth will occupy (another recent read, thus the reference). Written in the 1950s, it relates well to a lot of what is happening today, in 2006. You could take out various items that date the book, release it now, and today's reader would be none the wiser. While the inherent subject matter is not confidence building or heart-warming, it does show people what they feel is not a solitary emotion.This book is not for everyone. It's not a happy book, written in a happy place. It is not a corollary to Harry Potter, it is not a sequel to Charlotte's Web. The book is loaded with dark text, showing the dark inner thoughts of a young woman in the dark world that we live in. Entertaining, even funny at times, the subject material is surely serious and the potential reader should be ready for the like.Some call this a young woman's Catcher in the Rye. It's been too long since I read that book to say. Still, I certainly recommend this book. Well done and appropriate even for this day and age."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This book is simple yet extremely well written. Plath pulls everything together ina very easy way, but she goes much deeper than pure face meaning. She writes about Esther, a girl who is told she is crazy. Esther cannot seemto find a place in society where she fits. No one seems to understand her anywhere, and after many lifestyles she realizes there is no room for her in this world. Causing her so called depression. I reccomend this book to any women who ahs ever felt this way."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"After reading the biography of Pulitzer Prize winning poetess Anne Sexton of Newton, Massachusetts who committed suicide in 1974, I was gripped by the genuineness as well as the frank simplicity of The Bell Jar. In the Sexton biography - written by Diane Wood Middlebrook - there is a biographical passage on page 107 where, at the Ritz Hotel, Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton are having martinis and discussing suicide: &quot;Often, very often, Sylvia and I would talk at length about our first suicides; at length, in detail, and in depth between the free potato chips. Suicide is, after all, the opposite of the poem. Sylvia and I often talked opposites. We talked death with burned-up intensity, both of us drawn to it like moths to an electric light bulb. Sucking on it!&quot; One can only imagine the two grand dames of poetry confessing and professing to one another how they attempted it and would vow to do it successfully the next time around. I gather in the interim of their morbid discourse, Plath's haunting (if that is an approropriate word) statements as well as Anne's invoked within one another feelings of invidious, pressing desire for their own quiet world, a world not burdened by day-to-day realities. The Bell Jar, however, is not a literary biography in the true defination. Rather, it is a fictional memoir in the same element to that of Fredrick Exley's A Fan's Notes, but it is written in the similar stlye to that of her literary compatriot J.D. Salinger and his semi-acidulous novels. In it, we have Esther (Plath), a very endowed, intelligent young woman who wins a summer position as an editor/writer for a New York magazine; after that job, things begin to slide, mentally, for Esther. She is more than bright (Plath herself received a Fulbright Scholarship to Cambridge University), but there is a strong percolating aura that everything around Esther is too run-of-the-mill for her unique and unquiet mind. And when the mind is unique, restless and sickly, those become the proper ingredients for what Esther suffers and endures - a depression that goes beyond fatalism. With a rejection to a writing course and a lack of sincere understanding, she spirals downward to her mental breakdown, her bell jar firmly encapsulating her in the realm of madness. Her options for a cure are worse then the disease itself: electrical shock therapy, incarceration to a mental hospital, psychiatrists, attempted suffocation, warm water and a Gillette blade, and lastly and perhaps more potently, a lack of understaing of what she was going through. This isn't a novel that says, Pity me! It says, Undersatnd me! This is who I am! This is what I am going through! This is what I am seeing! This is how I am feeling! When the mind is inundated with the horrors of truths and medical misunderstandings, the chosen path can lead a person to a place he/she can never return from. Perhaps, in some ways, a lot more smaller to Sylvia's and Anne's, all of humanity lives in a bell jar."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Sylvia Plath made a significant contribution to the understanding of mental health with the publication of this book in 1971. She describes the mental health care that was offered in the 50&quot;s through her novel, The Bell Jar. It is widely acknowledged that this was more than a peak into her personal struggle, but a real reflection of how mental illness comes down on you, like a bell jar, where everything looks the same outside but there is pure confusion inside. This novel of such personal intensity explores the stages of the disease and the treatments that were available to her. It is far more in depth than Girl Interrupted. Both novels take on a difficult subject and give it the exposure it needs, which is what is really important. A poignant book worthy of continued success."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The Bell Jar is a first hand account of the mistakes and misgivings of psychologists in the 1950's.

Sylvia Plath shows why she is still read, studied, and talked about today."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"At this point it seems nearly impossible to write anything original about The Bell Jar, and just as impossible to write about this novel without referencing its thinly fictionalized rendering of her own breakdown, early suicide attempt, and hospitalization.It's ironic that Plath, herself, downplayed the importance of this book. There's so much here: a memoir-like telling of an bright and ambitious young woman's psychological break and climb toward recovery, the conflict of her ambitious career-minded self with the girl who wants to find a &#34;nice boy&#34; to marry, the low-simmer friction between the character and her widowed mother, her lurch toward becoming sexual (though instead of it being an empowering experience, it seems bloodily punishing).A Women's Studies student could have a heyday with this book, and there is some sharp class criticism to be found, too, and even some racism (the n-word makes an appearance). The book is like a time capsule from that era, but still holds up as relevant all these years later.A strange coincidence: I noted from the old library card in the back of the book that I was the last one to borrow it from the library, and I did so on this very day nineteen years ago. This time of year - late winter, and the time of year Plath died - seems to be the right time to read her work."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Book was decent at best.

Salinger I think you will enjoy The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Don't be fooled; this is not a classic book, just as Plath was not a novelist. She was a poet, and an amazing one. But a storyteller? A dramatist? Not really. So this book is of interest only biographically, as it applies to her life (because it was based in part on her experiences).Substandard, and don't be afraid to admit it after finishing it, despite her reputation. She wanted to be a novelist as well as a poet, yes; and she tried -- this being her best effort. But she wasn't a novelist. This is pulp work, frequently derivative, usually trite, even banal ... A lot like her short stories.The artist in development, but not the artist developed.That is has become a \\"classic\\" is due less to the work itself than to the death of the author, which is sad. The book is about a suicider, and the author committed suicide after writing a landmark book of poetry, and so many in consequence label this effort a classic. But it isn't. One does not have a lot to do with the other, really. If she hadn't died as she did, would \\"The Bell Jar\\" ever have been considered required reading? No, of course not. Nothing in it that indicates it should -- except again, as I said, the biographical import.I'm a huge fan of Plath, a real fan, and so I would urge readers away from this attempt and towards her real masterwork: Ariel."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I first read The Bell Jar as a teenager and I think I missed the point a bit. Like many of the reviewers who have given it a low rating, I found Esther's character difficult to relate to and I found the plot slow and slightly tedious. However, I re-read it recently and I was blown away. Perhaps because some of my close family members have recently been through very bad bouts of depression, I found that this novel resonated on a very personal level. Plath captures the awful claustrophobia of depression perfectly, and it is made all the more sadder with the realisation that she committed suicide soon after completing the novel. Maybe a lot of people will only find the true beauty in this book when they, or someone close to them, have experienced the all-consuming despair and lethargy of going through a similarly dark period. This book has definitely been promoted to one of my favourites and I am so glad I gave it another try."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I read this novel for a psychology class. On the whole, I can't say that I liked the novel very much. The beginning was interesting, and I did enjoy Plath's method of story-telling. But, it got very difficult to read once the novel progressed into the part where she starts to feel depressed. It was slightly disturbing to be in someone's mind who is descending into insanity. I would not recommend this book for the faint of heart."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This was beautifully written. The way Plath flexes the words to describe the smallest emotional experience is so right on the money, it felt like Ester's experiences were mine own. I just finished The Graduate, and found the depression and weakness of the main character disgusting and pathetic. After reading/listening to Maggie Gyllenhaal bring this book to life, the disgusting depression that The Graduate presented was clearly a failed attempt to make the transition from college to real life and the depression that can come with it tangible for the reader. I wish Sylvia Plath had written more. I love her style, the elegant transitions, and the honey she offers to pull you in. OH and Gyllenhaal's performance is A+ work. Her voice was very easy to follow, her cadence was perfect and the way she took on the character made me feel like I was living the whole thing. LOVED IT it is like a great movie...only longer! Maybe I'll listen again!"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"With the seas of collective enigma and awe that surrounds Sylvia Plath, this first and last novel of hers flows like that sea itself. 'The Bell Jar' starts off with a taste you can almost feel tingling on the tip of your tongue. That taste is hollowness.As Esther Greenwood tries to have that time of her life she thought she would getting this chance of a lifetime, she begins to experience an emptiness of sorts which, clearly, lies beyond words.Even as one reads the sentence after sentence, one is pulled in between those blank spaces to a world so completely black. As Esther describes the beginning of her breakdown, you begin to almost hear Sylvia Plath whispering the written words so ominously in your ears - whether you know how she sounds or not.For years Plath enchanted people with her poetry, but she knew she could manage more than that. With 'The Bell Jar' Miss Sylvia certainly manages MUCH more. Beautiful descriptions, believable, enriching dialogue, and a story that will resonate in the core of your heart forever.Some part of this book are so eerily haunting that you feel the pain Esther, and likely Miss Sylvia, must have felt. The hurting sometimes is so deep that you begin to wonder what it really would be like to be trapped in such a prison. Of course, those who already feel this melancholy - like myself - will be more than attracted to this book as it can become like a shared secret between the reader and the character.What also pleases me is this is a first-person narrative. The book is supposed to describe a 'crack-up' of sorts but the way Esther talks of what is slowly creeping into her, you can see that she is not 'crazy' at all but a human being at the end of the day.That personal, private touch to 'The Bell Jar' is a definite part in the success of this book. One is left to wonder what Sylvia Plath, a woman with such great words sprouting from the depths of her mind, could have written in the lost years of a life she chose to end."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I thought the beginning was excellent; I really liked the first paragraph.

Still worth reading."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This book is beautifully written and poignant in style. It really gives an insider's view of what clinical depression is like. The story is mostly bleak, but honest, with drops of hope given at the end."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The Bell Jar is a powerful coming of age story about the fictitious Esther Greenwood, whom author Sylvia Plath vicariously wrote as; and her struggle with societal expectations. As an outcast, Esther moves to New York City in the 1950's to work for a magazine. She deals with many life struggles causing her depression to worsen. Her depressive characteristics; obsession with fetuses and the Rosenburgs, sexual experimentation, attempted suicide, and disregard for society's norms, land her in an institution.Depression is a main theme of the novel along with personal growth (coming of age), society's restrictions on women, ethics of psychiatry, and cultural expectations. Esther is an anachronism, tied down by the prudish view on how women should be. She is a modern thinker, and sadly, not accepted for that.Sylvia Plath's cries from hell were evident in this eerily realistic novel. She wrote to the depressives and to those who can understand what she was dealing with. Presenting the never-ending conflict of Esther vs. society and convention, Plath made it very easy to fall into character and feel trapped under the very same \\"bell jar\\" of madness.I enjoyed reading The Bell Jar because it was so real and easy to relate to. Although it was a bit depressing at times, it wasn't whiny or pretentious. I highly recommend The Bell Jar for those who enjoy sociology, psychology, or just a good read. This compelling novel shouldn't be missed."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"How wonderful. I'm in love.

I think that is what is so ingenious about this novel. Depression itself makes no sense, and you could almost understand the confusion and hopelessness that Esther feels. As a 19-year-old college student battling with depression, I feel that reading this is one of the best ways for people to understand what it is really like. You also have to take into consideration the time when it was written- mental health was something that no one wanted to talk about or deal with. It must have taken a lot for Plath to come forth with this &quot;memoir.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"this book was one the greatest books i've ever read. sylvia was a strong, creative woman, trying to survive in a cruel world that just does not understand people. her sorrows and pain are all touched in this book. truly, a depressing story but so well written, that it touches you forever."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"There is no melodrama, or pretentious rambling here.

The brutally honest story of a young, dynamic woman\`s downfall into insanity is one that would define great literature. The protagonist, Esther Greenwood, captivates the reader as the book journeys through six months of her life, starting in a glitzy New York City trip, and ending in a mental institution in Conneticut. &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; examines the slow and painful breakdown of people, and how sometimes, hope doesn\`t seem to mean anything anymore."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I thought this book was a great way to find out what really goes on inside your head when your thinking of suicide. The author jumps around a lot but you can still understand what is going on. A definite read."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I thought that this book was beautifully written, because it was so harshly and bitterly honest. The main character, Ester Greenwood, was such a good protagonist because her pain, suffering and sadness completely blanketed the book with such truthfully heavy and sombre aura. Ester\`s agonizing fall into depression and madness was so afflicting, it was almost disturbing that someone\`s sanity could crumble so easily and so brutally. Sylvia Plath is a literary genius because &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; is a semi-autobiographical story, and the way she veiled her true life story with such magnificent writing is unforgettable."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"While &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; is well-written its portrayal of psychiatric care is rather out-dated. Stays in hospitals are often reduced to a few weeks or even days by insurance companies. Electroshock therapy is not as commonly used as a &quot;cure.&quot;Other than that, I thought this was a good book, though a bit tedious at times."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Considering its publication date, The Bell Jar's autobiographical tale of Sylvia Plath's descent into depression and insanity is an important book. However, the insinuations contained in it are disturbing. The Bell Jar seems to villify men in general for their lack of understanding. Rather than acknowledge that some people in general are distant, Plath turns men into whipping posts. It should be obvious to the unbiased reader, however, that Plath was just plain old insane. This reviewer feels bad for Ted Hughes, Plath's husband who has been blamed by two generations of literary feminists for Plath's suicide. Reading The Bell Jar should exonerate Hughes-- his wife was, unfortunately, mentally ill independent of his actions. Sylvia Plath should have taken responsibility for her own actions and her own condition."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I read this book in highschool and it nearly ruined modern fiction for me. I'm older now, have a masters degree in English, and I still find this book a boring, uninteresting, waste of time. To me Plath tries too hard to come across broken and tragic in her writing. Why do so many people think that a character's descent into madness makes for good reading? Wally Lamb's She's Come Undone is equally a waste of time in this regard."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Before I go into criticism of The Bell Jar, I will say that Sylvia Plath is an excellent writer but you can tell she's more of a poet than a novelist. That having been said, I felt absolutely no connection with any of the characters in this novel. Esther just seems unsatisfied 24/7 and never wants to connect with anyone. The whole premise of the book is just dark, depressing, and disturbing. It sounds like Sylvia Plath wrote this like a personal diary and replaced her name with Esther Greenwood. While reading this, I was asking myself, \\"What goes on in this woman's mind and what makes her think this is alright to show to the general public?\\" Nobody wants to relax by reading a book about suicide, cutting yourself, depression, etc. This book is out-dated because the teenage suicide rates in the 1950s weren't as high as the ones today which should give teachers a reason not to have students read this for an assignment. Plath tries to present suicide as a rational solution to any problem in \\"The Bell Jar.\\" What if a person who has considered suicide read this book? This is NOT a classic at all. Classics have memorable stories and characters that we as the readers can connect to. \\"The Bell Jar\\" makes no connection at all to the reader. Sometimes authors have to know what their limits in writing are when it comes to what the general public wants to read.

I hope that she found some comfort in writing, but honestly, was this meant to be published?It's not a surprise that many readers find this repulsive. English teachers/professors should not require students to read this; it goes against every basic human tendency to be happy and not to be anti-life.

This will lead us to the end.&quot; Then we're repeatedly taken off of that path, down apparent detours without meaning or relevance. This is a deception.By the time you reach the halfway point you'll see that what seems to be important is only a grounding place for what surrounds it.

The protagonist,Esther Greenwood have numerous similarities to Plath. Reading this heart-breaking novel was a totally unforgettable experience. The book began with narration of Esther,19 and trying to write something in the summer in New York,1950. Esther like Plath was going through a difficult phase with life. She expereinced failures and distress and with unstable mind plus a little this and that lead to mental illness which eventually lead to suicide. Plath depicted the whole situation and events so vividly. Only one been through those thoughts and suffering could relate.Plath wrote it with so much empathy and conscientious. She was crying out for help to her mental unstableness and woe she was going through. Through Esther, she voiced out her feeling, sorrow,emotions and those things going through her mind at that time. Only Plath will know the truth...Since this novel was published a month before her death at 30.Wonder how come no one approach to help her.If at that time she had more love,care and support,maybe there's hope, or maybe not...."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Before Bridget Jones, before Girls Guide, there was The Bell Jar.

Taking it upon myself to see if the book did indeed reveal the mystery of Sylvia Plath's disease (for that is truly what it is), I found it to pleasantly display her feelings during the book's time frame. Between Esther's high's and low's and her continual obsession with the thought of suicide until she finally tries it for herself, and then the eventual downfall of her friend, to the release of her from the confining spaces of the institution and the horror of shock therapy. I have heard many people voice a disatified emotion toward the somewhat abrupt ending of the book. I myself, while looking at the end of Plath's life, could easily see the path that Esther would soon follow. It shows a fantastic look into the unpredictableness of mental illness and describes, in detail the uncomfortableness of being trapped inside the distorting effects that the bell jar can produce upon us. For those of you who are fortunate enough to not know the tragic effect produced by the bell jar, you are truly the lucky ones."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I thought this was one of the American classics I should read...

Therefore, giving it a higher rating would be unappropriate.As a young inspiring author, I enjoyed reading the segment with Sylvia attempting to write a book.I also appreciated her gift of expressing depression. Rather than writing something like, &quot;I felt as if the terrible burden of depression was laid upon me, crushing me whole,&quot; as many authors would do, her experiences through mental angst made the writing genuine. Most writers, do not portray a skewed perception of the victim as Plath did.The Bell Jar is genuine, and that's what makes it impact its readers.All in all, some great writing by Plath, but the novel itself does not compete with the classics. And why should it? She was not a novelist but a poet. I would recommend it, however, as I would any of Plath's poetry."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath begins with Esther's, the main character, internship with a fashion magazine in New York, and then goes back a few years into her college days. It goes on to tell about Esther becoming crazy. It seems that she has an almost perfect life; she had received numerous awards for her writing. However she struggles within herself. This book is very close to an autobiography of Plath, and is an alarmingly realistic view of being suicidal. It is written in a surprisingly calm tone, but one might wonder why is on high school reading lists."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"In reading this book I became very depressed. Esther didn't have any thing good to say about anyone. Everyone was ugly in some way. There was always something wrong. Of course, the shock treatments she had to endure would make anyone negative. What were those people thinking? The Bell Jar echoes madness from start to finish. The entire book was difficult to take. I didn't want to read time after time of Esther trying to end her life. In fact her life was really just beginning.The author Sylvia Plath puts her descriptive writing to great use. She chronicles Esther's life with great style. Esther just didn't have such a great life. Her boy friend, Buddy, was nothing but a thorn in her side. I think Esther felt she was above Buddy and rightly so. It's too bad Esther had to go mad during the time that she did. If this were to happen now there would be a lot better cures for her to turn to.I think it's difficult to read a book about going insane. I guess because it make you question your own sanity. The pressure that was on Esther was mainly the fact that she was an over achiever. The author wrote that she studied too much; she didn't really know when to quit. I think it was a very sad book. Too read about someone with such an enormous cloud over their head. Really more like a bell jar over their head."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"After finish reading &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; by Sylvia Plath, I wasn't left with those weird when emotions whne a really good book affects you. As a matter of fact, I wasn't surprise that the author committed suicide. In life, when people feel enclosed and that no one cares, people are driven to desperate measures. Especially during the time Esther/Sylvia were living in. Us women have to deal with many issues. Always have and always will. The novel just makes me think that does reality really exist or do we just live in a fantasy world and not care with goes on around us? Reality is much scarier than fiction."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Plath gets you in tune with only one character throughout this book.

Her description of places and events throughout the story were fascinating."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"While many people rave about this story I fail to see where it's brilliance is. I read it upon recommendation by a friend. And while I did enjoy the style in which it was written, overall this book left me feeling empty. I felt I had wasted my time. Mostly because I could not at all sympathize with the main character except in the most extreme of cicumstances, such as the shock therapy. Other than those few moments, I did not feel like she was subject to any unusually cruel acts or treatment. The majority of my disappointment came in the end. I felt there wasn't any kind of payoff, no real conclusion.Maybe I was distracted by all the little notes my friend had written in the book. Maybe it's simply because I'm a guy (which I sincerely doubt.) Personally, I would much rather read Ms. Plath's poetry than trudge this this little volume again.I give it two stars, for while I didn't necessarily enjoy the plot, the prose were downright hilarious at times!..."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Reading Sylvia Plath's novel, The Bell Jar, is like entering the life of a young woman that is trying to grow up in a male-dominated society. The main chareacter, Esther Greenwood, is approached by many mental and physacle obsticles. Her mind is overcomed by many emotions and menatlly challenged problems. She struggles with many issues from suicide to relationships. The Bell Jar is a great book for woman and especially teens. It deals with some issues that young ladies deal with everyday. Esther Greenwood portrayed a self-reliant woman, but was in need of help from the world that she avoided. Sylvia's style of writing is very simplistic and easy to understand, but is also full of radiant detail. It's not a story that causes bordem, but instead curiosity and interest. This book is said to be a reflection of the Plath's life,but is also a reflecton to lives of many young woman all over the world. This novel is some what disturbing but is a true American classic."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"At first one is struck by the surprising, fresh, and often delightful descriptive metaphors that light up the pages of this book (3 or 4 of these are so strikingly apt that they may stick with the reader; e.g., the \\"eye of a tornado\\" already on p.3), but beyond mid-book even these have become tiresome through overuse. \\"Much metaphor and a dash of feminism, both gratuitous\\" pretty much sums up this work. The purported insights (deep or otherwise) into mental illness and a plunge into it, are simply not there, except perhaps for those so young or naive as to have never thought or experienced much. There is that sort of caste to it which is familiar in that which seems often to appeal to histrionic and/or etiolated young females. Beyond that, and its feministic arrogation, one can perhaps see one other reason for its apparent popularity among a certain readership: its lack of any real nexus (other than serving as a cathartic for SP, herself) invites emotive readers to read into it what they will, including their own themes and prejudices."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I chose to read The Belle Jar because I had the book and always wanted to read it but didn't have the time. It happened to be an autobiographical novel too. I have heard a lot of people talk about the book and how good written it was. Also, my mom recommended it; it was her favorite book in collage. I've heard that you had to read it in high school, so now I have a head start. Sylvia Plath, the author, committed suicide in her early thirties. I thought it would be interesting to read a memoir of a suicidal feminist.The book is about a girl, Esther Greenwood, in the 1950's. She won a contest to go to New York for the summer and be a guest fashion editor for Ladies' Day magazine. While she is in New York she befriends some of the other guest fashion editors, Doreen and Betsy. Esther believes she is more like Betsy than Doreen. One night on the way to a party two men, Lenny and Frankie, stop her and Doreen in their cab. They go out to dinner with them. Frankie leaves early and Doreen spends the night at Lenny's apartment while Esther walks home. The pounding of the door of her hotel room wakes Esther up. Doreen comes in wasted and passes out. In the morning, everyone got food poisoning from the breakfast. Buddy, Esther's old boyfriend wants to marry her, but she doesn't want to because she thinks she can't maintain her duties as a wife and write poetry at the same time. Also, she thinks it's unfair that women are expected to stay \\"pure\\" until they're married, while men are not held to such strict standards. She wants to lose her virginity because she's frustrated with her naivety. Esther believes it will transform her. She realizes that a man would never sleep with the women he loved because he thinks it seems animal-like.She goes on a blind date, with Doreen and Lenny, with a one of Lenny's friends, Marco. Marco is a \\"woman-hater\\". He makes Esther dance with him even though she doesn't want to. He tries to rape her in a puddle of mud. She thinks if she just lies there \\"it\\" will happen. Then he calls her a slut and she begins to fight back, she punched him in the nose and he smears his blood on Esther's cheeks. She took the train back to her hotel in Manhattan. She changes and takes the train to Massachusetts, where she lives.The family doctor refers her to a psychiatrist, Dr. Gordon. He does nothing but make matters worse. Dr. Gordon doesn't listen, is conceited, and sends her to shock treatment. Esther attempts suicide four times. She tried slitting her wrists but couldn't bring her self to it, hanging her self but couldn't find a high enough place to do it, drowning herself but keeps floating to the surface, and taking fifty sleeping pills. After trying to overdose, she passes out and wakes up in a hospital bed. In the hospital, Esther meets her new psychiatrist, Dr. Nolan. She likes Dr. Nolan a lot, she thinks of her as a mother figure.Esther sees Joan, buddy's old girlfriend and collage acquaintance. Joan says that after reading about Esther's suicide attempts in the newspaper, it inspired her to try also. They become good friends, but later on Joan tells Esther that she likes her. Esther gets mad and Joan walks away. She tells Dr. Nolan that she wants to lose her virginity but is worried about pregnancy, Dr. Nolan sends her to another doctor to get a diaphragm. Esther now needs to pick whom to give it up to.She loses it to a math professor named Irwin whom she met in the Harvard library. After, she starts bleeding and it will not stop. She goes to the emergency room and the doctor stops it. When she gets back to the mental institute she is staying at, she gets out before school starts again. She discovers that Joan is missing. Later, they found her; she hung herself in the woods.Esther calls Irwin and demands that he pay for the medical bill of that night. He asked if he was ever going to see her again, she replies \\"Never,\\" then hangs up. Now she feels free. Buddy came to visit and asks if she thought that buddy had anything to do with Joan's suicide. After the funeral she waits for her final interview with her doctors, she walks into the room.This book was very poetically written. It also refers to a fig tree to represent the options she wants, but she is paralyzed with indecision and the figs fall of and die. A belle jar is a clear, glass jar that people use to display things, or acts like a vacuum when closed. It's called The Belle Jar because she feels as if there were a belle jar hovering above her about to drop and suffocate her. At the end of the book, she feels that it has been lifted but may come down again at any time.This book reminded me of a movie I saw called Girl, Interrupted. It's similar because both are about a girl in an institute who deals with suicide and sex. How a girl went from living normally to having sex with a stranger, committing suicide, and living in a mental institute, when in fact they are not that psychotic. Sylvia Plath did a beautiful way of explaining in this book, I understood everything rather than sitting confused. I would recommend this book to anyone in eighth grade or higher, or they might not understand it. Probably someone who likes poetry would like this book."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The Bell Jar, written by Sylvia Plath, is an extremely insightful autobiography that reveals Plath's inner turmoil through her thoughts and actions. The plot of Plath's story begins with her winning an assignment on a New York fashion magazine, which was a dream come true for her. This dream soon became raveled up in Plath's distress and became one of the many pieces of the puzzle of Plath's life, which soon transformed into a living nightmare. Due to her illness and her mental breakdown, Plath, or Esther, as she is known in the book, had to go to a psychiatrist and even had to be treated with electric shock therapy. Plath took a very immature approach toward dealing with her turmoil and mental breakdowns by attempting to kill herself several times. Although she felt this was the way out of her despair, she never had the will or strength to go through such a drastic measure of coping with her problems. Plath eventually found inner peace and satisfication in her life. I believe the theme of The Bell Jar is that depression, frustration, and hardship come in everybody's life at one point or another and we all must know how to handle it properly and not to turn to a rash solution such as suicide. Several small elements such as tone and symbolism actually play a big role in the depth of this novel's true meaning. This novel has a factual tome in the very beginning, but as the story progresses, it becomes one of despair and suspense. Also, the title has very powerful symbolism in it. The title of The Bell Jar refers to a cylindrical glass vessel with a rounded top and an open base used to protect and display fragile objects or to establish a controlled atmosphere or environment in scientific experiments. Most likely, the meaning behind this symbolism is that throughout her stay at the mental hospital, Plath felt as if she was in a bell jar because she was fragile and liable to break at any time. This feeling developed through her stay at the hospital because she knew she was quite ill and in a way felt trapped in the hospital due to her illness. Plath probably also felt as if she had no way out and she may not be able to live a normal life again. The Bell Jar has a very influential and positive social significance. This book probably can relate to how many people might have felt at least at one point of their life. People who have felt that way and have read the book before most likely can share their depression and despair more easily with others and learn to cope with their problems seeing how Plath managed to get through her despair. Therefore, this novel has great meaning and purpose on society because the fact is that more people you may think consider suicide. I can honestly say this novel, The Bell Jar, written by Sylvia Plath, is very enjoyable, and depressing at the same time, to read. It offers a chance to see how life can be so depressing sometimes, yet there's always a reasonable solution; you just have to be very determined to find that solution."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Esther, the main character, is a racist, homophobic narcissist, as superficial as she is sensitive, as innocently waifish as she is ruthlessly passive-aggressive, always needing more than the world has to offer. She's an interesting mass of contradictions, but for me ultimately unlikeable, making the first-person narration sometimes hard to take.The first half of the book, set in New York where Esther is interning or something at a women's magazine, is the most engaging. It's like a cross between Sex And The City and My So-Called Life. She indulges fully in the glamorous lifestyle she is afforded on the company dime, but laments being numb to the experience.In the second half the narration continues taking a more lamenting than expository tone, ranging in effect from tragically romantic, when she actively commits to her decision to give up on life, to just whiney, when she seems to be demanding sympathy for insensitive or cruel treatment she suffers but does little to combat or avoid. The book seems more like a plea for pity than understanding a lot of the time.There are a few uniquely effective instances of metaphor and descriptive writing, but many more that are banal enough to encourage skimming, so whatever points Plath earns for vision are lost for filler.All in all I can't say the book's not interesting, but I can't say I'd recommend it."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I have mixed feelings about this book. I liked the precision of Plath's writing, and parts of the book were excellent. But it is so detatched, and there is so little character development or background story, so I found myself just not caring much for Esther Greenwood (the protagonist), nor really understanding the reasons for her inner torment.There are a few scenes where we get a glimpse of her childhood and some of the issues she had to deal with. But these glimpses are brief and fleeting, and left me wanting much more. For the most part, I found Esther to be remote, self-obsessed, and not very likeable, which left me indifferent to her plight.Mostly, I was frustrated at Esther's unwillingness to cooperate with those who are trying to help or, or her unwillingless to help herself. She wants to wallow in her misery. So wallow she does. And because she feels that everyone else is the cause of her problems, she makes no effort to look inward.If Esther is a thinly disguised Plath, it is no surprise Plath's life ended with suicide. It seems inevitable. Esther is hell-bent on failure, in spite of the best efforts of those around her.I'm glad I read The Bell Jar for the simple reason that it feels like an authentic and honest depiction of a young person's descent into mental illness. Depression affects millions of people. It's an important issue that needs to be explored and understood. And Plath does a fair (but incomplete) job of it. I only wish I liked the Esther more. I found myself not caring very much about her fate. Neither, apparently, did she."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Insanity is a weird thing - most people are \`insane' to some degree or the other - while a minority succumb to the polarities of the disease and swing back and forth much like a pendulum. Sylvia Plath fell into the latter category, and while the positive end of her spectrum meant that she created some shockingly good work, the negative end ensured that she would meet a tragic and self-inflicted end. Her suicide I think, remains the most mechanical, yet most poetic death of all the great writers, and it's a pity that shes often remembered as \`that woman poet who stuck her head in an oven' when in fact she was well spoken, eloquent woman whose command over the English language was much vaster and encompassing than yours or mine.\\"The Bell Jar\\", her only full length fictional prose work, is almost autobiographical in patches. The publishers make it clear that this is not Plaths' own story, but you cannot help but identify the lead character as Plath herself. The way I see it is this - Sylvia created a fictional character, but gave it her mind and thoughts, leading to one of the most fascinating fictional characters in modern prose. To me, this was the literary equivalent of a convergence of both David Lynch's masterpieces \\"Inland Empire\\" and \\"Mulholland Drive\\". The same \\"a woman in trouble, yet she doesn't know it yet\\" theme permeates the entire novel, and by the time it reaches its (somewhat obvious) conclusion, you're left wondering how Plath didn't invest more of her time in churning out full fledged prose novels.Simply put, this novel chronicles the descent of a womans' mind, but its so much more than that. It speaks of mental disease with a frankness that the author probably didn't quite comprehend at the time. Maybe she did, but either way, I think what she was doing her was to capture the state of her own mind frame by frame until that fateful day in real life when she so notoriously took her own life. \\"The Bell Jar\\" has its moment of adolescent wandering and naivete, which I found quite endearing considering the age of the author when she wrote this. Perhaps she wasn't mature enough to deal with life as she grew older, or maybe she was too caught up in her own web of literary wonder to crawl out of it. I think all the great poets were afflicted to some degree with this disease, and Plath is no exception.If you're interested in a semi-autobiographical (though the blurb won't admit it!) book by a great poet, this is the book for you. Its never boring, and is quite an easy read as Sylvia trades in her famous double entendre poetic metaphors for more easily accessible and simply written language. Short crisp sentences. Clear dialogue. And yet, the sentences get shorter, and thoughts get more fragmented as we plummet with the author into the very depths of insanity. An unforgettable, and somewhat scary experience - but as a book lover, one you should definitely experience.Five Stars."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Sylvia Plath was one of those mysterious figures in twentieth century literature whose work I had never read...until now. This is one of those rare novels that is arresting from the first page to the last, not least because of its obvious autobiographical nature, in its thinly veiled descriptions of characters drawn from Plath's life during a six month period in her early twenties, primarily in the character of Esther herself. Plath indicated after the novel was written that this work was autobiographical, with only the addition of a little fiction to give it a little more colour. We witness the descent into herself of a compelling literary character, one in whom the seeds of melancholy reside deeply. The society girl who does not quite fit in, not feeling fully connected with her friends, her boyfriend, or herself. One who has a mother who is remote, a father who died while she was a young girl; a younger brother who is absent. She disconnects further, and we see the marks of a deep depression descend on her, as she starts to withdraw from life into her solitude, and a wretched one at that. Depression and sleeplessness and hopelessness overtake her and she goes through the motions of therapy, treatment, being committed to an asylum, electro-shock treatment, a pervasive obsession with death and suicide, and ultimately, several attempts to end her life. This would be great fiction if indeed the sadness of its direct parallels to Plath's life were not present. Some of her descriptions are deeply disturbing, in a way that I have only otherwise encountered in someone like Augusten Burroughs (a present day writer of a similarly harrowing memoir, \\"Running With Scissors\\"). In any event, this novel is further truth that some of history's finest writers and artists are also among those most tortured and unhappy.Not a happy read at all, rather one that left me with an overwhelming sadness, but filled with appreciation for its beauty and strength. Despite her early departure from this earth (Plath ended her life shortly after the publication of \\"The Bell Jar\\"), this work, along with her collections of poetry, remains and keeps her alive to those who read her words."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I had heard of \\"The Bell Jar\\" for a long time before I picked it up to read it. My friend and fellow writer, Greg Goodsell, liked to read Sylvia Plath's work at the Open Mic's we attended. I would hear her name and think, \\"I am so woefully under-educated in these classics.\\" For the past few years I have set to righting that wrong.Sylvia Plath's tale of Esther Greenwood's stumble into insanity mirrors her own journey in many uncanny ways. It is not unlike the words of Virginia Woolf who wrote \\"\\"If one shuts one's eyes and thinks of the novel as a whole, it would seem to be a creation owning a certain looking-glass likeness to life.\\"Esther's life mirrors not only Plath's life, it also mirrors many others of us who have experienced depression. The voice is as clear and familiar as the rooms in my home - known intimately through daily experience. Plath's writing is evocative, clear and haunting.We are witness to Esther's journey first as an intern at a woman's magazine - a highly coveted position - to her tumble into deep depression, hospitalization, and return to \\"the outside\\". We witness her continued losses (one of her friends succumbs to suicide, her experience of shock treatment, her first love relationships.My favorite lines in the montage of tremendous lines are these, both from the final chapter::\\"A fresh fall of snow blanketed the asylum grounds, not a Christmas sprinkle, but a man-high January deluge, the sort tha snuffs out schools and offices and churches, and leaves, for a day or more, a pure, blank sheet in place of memo pads, date books and calendars.\\"\\"I took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart. I am, I am, I am....\\"This book is now used in many classrooms. This is a very good thing, to explore insanity as well as witness a writer capable of creating such beauty and at the same time, not being able to continue with her own life.I would also suggest readers study Plath's poetry, my favorite collection being \\"Ariel\\". Finally, if you are especially taken with the life of Sylvia Plath, there is a DVD you may want to rent starring Gwyneth Paltrow in the lead role and is entitled \\"Sylvia.\\" I found it to be highly telling and entertaining."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I found Sylvia Plath's \\"The Bell Jar\\" to be an excellent read and source of understanding. It is not just another book, but a mirror in which the souls of many are reflected. Young women of all generations, both young and old, can relate to the situations young Elly finds herself in, from the awkward boys she meets and the \\"perfect\\" best friend, to the moments she feels as though life itself is not worth living. Ultimately, she is the female version of young Holden Caufield, and for that reason, the book finds such success.While I found it quite easy to relate to the main character in the book, I found bits and pieces of the story itself to be quite confusing. Several questions remain unanswered, and one must work actively to \\"connect the dots.\\" However, perhaps the abrupt twists and turns Plath takes throughout the story are meant to throw the reader off course, and further explore the inner workings of Elly's psyche.All in all, I would rank Plath's \\"The Bell Jar\\" at 5 stars, because that it was it truly deserves. Never before has a book kept my mind so intrigued and eager to move forward than that about a young woman named Elly."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"In the autobiographical novel of a young girl struggling with her place in life, I have learned about the society of the 1950's and the workings of a brilliant mind gone awry in Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar. This young girl is Ester Greenwood, a teenager enrolled in the honors program in her college, and who seems to be having everything go her way. Her high school love, Buddy Willard, proposed to her, and she was also sent on a scholarship to see the glamour and glitz of NYC for a month. All this may seem like a dream come true, but Ester finds herself in a nightmare. Her friends don't seem to matter to her, she is repulsed by fianc&eacute;e-to-be, and her dream of becoming a professor/poet isn't as enticing as it once was. Ester keeps sinking down deeper into a slump and becomes more detached from the world. When she comes home for the summer, her condition worsens, she swallows a bottle of sleeping pills, and shortly finds herself in a mental hospital. Her recovery is steady, and eventually is released before her next college term, but she learns important lessons about herself and her world in the mean time.These lessons involve the complicated society of the 1950's, where women are happy being wives and homemakers, and willingly submit to their husbands. Ester's mental instability was not portrayed as dark and disturbed, but merely confused. Ester found herself \\"sitting in the crotch of a fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant loosing all the rest, and as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.\\" (63) One fig was a husband, another a successful career, and still another a ticket around the world. Ester's indecision 50 years ago made me realize how people have stayed the same, and showed how realistically she was characterized. The story of Ester was a coming of age novel where she began to mature and see how her life would unfold. Her case was not resolved perfectly, since with every life story, there are always doubts and mistakes. The nonperfect ending was part of what made me like the book so much.The Bell Jar was a perfect selection for me, being a young girl in a changing society. It showed me how much people are influenced by their relationships and surroundings, but not in a moralizing way. The book was witty and surprisingly humorous considering its subject, honest and bold. What I also enjoyed about the book was the ties that were present to the real life of Sylvia Plath, who had a mental breakdown and suicide attempt as well. The similarities to a true story made the setting and characters very real, since some characters were loosely based on people in the author's life. The plot isn't particularly suspenseful or fast-moving, but I was very drawn into it, and I recommend others to read this clever and interesting account of a young girl's undoing and recovery."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I just read the Bell Jar, and I was shocked at how much I could relate to the main character. Esther is 19 years old, and at that age I was feeling and experiencing so many of the same things. The time was different, the specifics were different, and our genders are different, and yet this book hit so close to home that it was uncomfortable, and yet cathartic, to read it. This book perfectly depicts the feeling of being a very young adult in our society, and looking at the world around you and seeing absolutely nothing that appeals to you. It depicts the confusion, pain, isolation, and even insanity that can be the result. I would recommend this book to anyone, but especially to young people who are struggling to find their footing in a society that can be cold, frightening, and overwhelming."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I read this book upon the recommendation of my best friend. I am a teenager and like many of the other people who have written reviews for &quot;The Bell Jar&quot;, I have suffered from depression. When I was reading this book, I was surprised by how similar Esther's feelings were to my own. Some reviews mention that they feel that her depression is not credible. I on the other hand thought her depression felt real and justified, almost tanglible. The bell jar is a perfect metaphor for how you can sometimes feel while afflicted with depression. The detached feeling can be insufferable. I thoroughly enjoyed, and was touched by this book. It is definitely worth a read..."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This seems to me to be one of those books that you absolutely have to read even if you know you'll hate it - just because it's so important, so touted and so, well, very well-written. Like the summaries say, it &quot;chronicles a gifted young woman's descent into insanity.&quot; It's very realistic because it was drawn directly from real life - the protagonist (one Esther Greenwood) _is_ Sylvia Plath, more or less. Plath very vividly describes every detail of every day, and fleshes out her character completely.My one impression was bewilderment at the emptiness, soullessness and lack of purpose of most of the characters in the book, Esther included. However, this was not due to the author but due to the author's subjects - people _are_ really like that, and you'll realize that at some point in the book and you'll hope to hell that you're different. (So just for that little revelation, I recommend it.) Every one of the characters is so real that you probably know someone exactly like them - the crusty Jay Cee, the means-well-but-is-a-complete-jerk Buddy Willard, all the various young women who think nothing of giving away their bodies to a fleeting acquaintance, Esther, who is incapable of achieving anything despite her obvious talent and so plans to affirm her identity through sleeping with someone she just met, etc. None of them are exaggerated in the least.At the end, the story will leave the readers asking why all this happened, why Esther went crazy, why she couldn't do something with her talents, why no one seems to have any reason to take up space on the earth, whose fault is it, what do we do about it, why it has to be like this, and so on. The book provides no answers to any of that, and unfortunately, it's too late to ask Sylvia Plath to answer."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I loved this book! It's not a very long book, only about 200 pages or so, but man oh man it's an intense read. In my case it took me a year to read this book, so I felt like I was right with Ester Greenwood. I'm the biggest Sylvia Plath fan that I know and I was turned on to her by reading &quot;Daddy&quot; in an english class I had. And I just have about everything that she has done. Her way with words is sexy and at the same time dark, it seems very unusally for a woman in the 1950's and 1960's to have written like that, but I think it's great she broke the gender role! It's truly a shame that she never wrote another novel like this one, even though there are rumors that there's half of an unfinshed book of hers out there. Man we better call Mulder and Scully."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I have just re-read Sylvia Plath's, &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; having first read it some 20+ years ago as a teenager. Now, as then, it flowed gracefully before me as though I were sitting beside a stream, watching water move, instead of words across the pages of a paperback. Plath's unmatched mastery of metaphors astounds. Her grace and style and ease make &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; seem like one is hearing one's own thoughts; her thoughts and her words would be my thoughts and words in a parallel situation. They would be the thoughts and words of women all around the world, were we all so articulate to communicate them as efficiently as does Plath. Style, it seems, was her greatest weapon.&quot;The Bell Jar&quot; is Sylvia's autobiography-meets-enough-fiction-so-as-not-to-make-my-friends-and-family-ticked-off-at-me. She remarks in one passage about some works of writing being such that she loved them so much that she wished she could climb in, into the pages, between the lines as though between the opening of a split rail fence. &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; is like this. The reader feels they know Plath -- she is like the best friend you always wanted to be more like. Her story here is not simply an interesting compilation of anecdotes, but a friendship and connection with a young woman too brilliant. Because there is such a thing.I highly recommend this book, and ANYTHING and EVERYTHING by Sylvia Plath. Seldom has so gifted a writer placed foot upon this planet."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Sylvia Plath paints a vivid portrait of a privileged life gone terribly wrong. The Bell Jar is a (somewhat) autobiographical account of Plath's breakdown and depression. This novel gives you an intimate look at the story behind the poetry. Somewhere along the way, this amazing author/poet suffered a breakdown which sent her spiraling into a deep and rather dark depression. The Bell Jar explains to readers, in almost desturbing detail, Plath's story from her time at Smith College to the various asylums in which she was treated by such meathods as electroshock therapy. A definate must-read for all Plath fans as well as anyone looking for someone to relate to during difficult times. In relation to the controversy over the novel and Plath's suicide, I must say that it only intregues the reader more and inspires them to learn more about this inspirational author/poet."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This is the only novel written by the famous poet Sylvia Plath. It is autobiographical in many aspects and covers her attempted suicide. The critics thought this book wasn't as literary as they had expected and I agree that it was more fun than seriously literary. They predicted the next novel that she was in the process of writing would be better in a literary sense but she never finished it before her suicide. I agree that the book is not of the same literary quality as her poems and that this is worth mentioning in a book review, but it was still great and it is a must read for any Plath fan.This novel starts with the heroine's coveted internship with a posh fashion magazine in New York City, and then retracts to cover past aspects of her life, such as college and dating. The story then continues to the heroine's descent into madness, including her experiences with phsycologists and asylums and electric shock therapy.This is one of the best books I have read recently. Parts of it made me laugh out load and other parts made me incredibly sad. The heroine experienced and felt things so deeply, and Plath had a way of making me feel them and experience them along with her. This is a fast-paced and still thought-provoking book that I finished very quickly, and then went back to read some parts again and savor the sweet little details. The Bell Jar deserves to be on everyone's bookshelf, or better yet, bedside table, being read and reread again for the delicious little emotional masterpiece that it is."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"To be honest, if there's one thing that I didn't understand in this book, it's the title.The rest just made perfect sense.Plath is clearly a poet of some kind. Her writing flows beautifully and lyrically. It has the smooth edge only a poet can achieve in fiction. This is both a positive thing and a negative one. While it makes aspects incredibly well written, it also makes the book a tad bit over-indulgent.Or, it would, if there wasn't the whole story around it. Without having known Plath's background story when I picked this up, I knew instantly that this was real. Perhaps the name was changed and some things tweaked, but this just breathed so perfectly. I knew that this was honest, open, and true, and the whole world of Sylvia Plath/Esther Greenwood sucked me in.It went beyond the nice writing. It went into the emotions. I couldn't tear myself away from the book. It made me think, it made me wonder, and it (most of all) made me feel. At times I was disgusted, at times I was amazed, at times I was crying - but I was there all along. It's a vivid, clear account of depression, and a world that is practically unknown.What's for sure is that this will stay with me for years to come, both in my mind and in my heart. It makes one appreciate life without depression, teaches a lot, and is an overall incredible, breath-taking ride.A necessity."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Sylvia Plath has always managed to chill me and amaze me with her awesome talent with words, but until you have read The Bell Jar, you haven't experienced the full mastery of Sylvia Plath. I received The Bell Jar last year on my 14th birthday and when I first read it, it was like yet another slap in the face delivered by Sylvia. This book is a huge reality check and yes, like Sylvia's other works, it can be quite disturbing at times. The Bell Jar doesn't try to amuse you by saying that the world is a big happy place like many other novels do. It deals with reality - real issues and real fears surrounding a young woman searching for an identity in a harsh, unrelenting world. Sylvia Plath isn't afraid to tell you what the world is really like and how it can break a woman who's future seems a bright one. But the character's (Esther Greenwood) transitions from sanity to insanity are so subtle that it is difficult to distinguish the two at times. The Bell Jar is a look into the human mind that is dark and sadly cynical at times, but it is a novel that anyone can relate to. Everyone is searching for an identity just as Sylvia's Esther Greenwood was. And anyone can cross the thin line that separates sanity from insanity, just as Sylvia Plath did."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"In a world of over-medicated persons, \\"The Bell Jar\\" delivers what modern medicine cannot... a look into the life of a person without the use of modern medication or therapies. \\"The Bell Jar\\" delivers an insight into the world of the depressed woman, then and now. For a person in some sort of depressed state, Sylvia Plath gives us a world in which someone \\"understands\\".While she did not end her life on a good note, for those in need of understanding and not just \\"a good read\\", \\"The Bell Jar\\" offers a shoulder to lean on... a possible much needed cry.If you are reading this just as a classic novel, her metaphor and use of grammar to convey her life and loss is at it's peak. She give us a story thick with imagery, location, and tangible emotion. Her vivid scope of mental illness and the lengths one will go to in a chance to feel something other than a sense of loss or anguish, is all at once painful and beautiful. You know exactly where she is coming from, even if you have never experienced it for yourself. She transports us to a place and state of mind that is malicious and elegant... troubled and decadent.Sylvia's poetry is wonderful, if that is what you are looking for. But it is her novels, short stories, letters, and prose that can send you to a place where even the average person feels a kinship with this tortured soul. And tortured is exactly what she conveys.... those demons that in the end, caught up with her all too soon."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I first read this book when I was 12, and to my English teacher's horror: I received the question \\"Does your mother know you're reading that!?\\" to which I had the all-too-smug pleasure of being able to honestly reply that \\"Yes, she does, as she is the one who suggested it.\\"The Bell Jar is just incredible, hands down. I am not the kind of reader who regards it as a sort of proto-feminist canon, instead, I try to limit myself to taking it in through its most legitimate, face-value feeling. There is a \\"realness\\" to it that is just too good.As poor a context for crediting it with anything positive as it is, it was my first literary introduction to New York City. There are scenes in it that, even now- years later, stand out so clearly in my mind: when she's walking down the street in the midle of the night, drunk out of her mind, and yet somehow lucid enough to find her way home- tracing her hand along the sides of buildings all the way; or the time she stands outside, stories and stories up in the building she's staying in, and proceeds to throw all her clothes out the window, one by one, floating away in the New York midnight breeze.There is a numbness to the story that trudges along like a silent locomotive: you know the tracks are out ahead and the crash is imminent, you just don't know how, or when, or where, or just how bad it will be. And it is bad, it is really bad, but that's also why it's so good. Not to say that tragedy is a hallmark of literary worth, but the tragedy \\"works\\" here because it is just simply too real.As other reviewers have noted, it is a little disturbing that it ends well, when Plath, herself did not. Yet, in the end, maybe that is the best irony of it? Regardless, it's one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Many times I have noticed Sylvia Plath's intimate autobiographical novel labeled as a \\"feminist novel\\" or placed in Listmania lists of feminist books. Although, \\"feminism\\" is a term that has been loosely defined, I want to say, \\"Uh-uh.\\" Do a few encounters with jerky men constitute a feminist label? I doubt it. Does its portrayal of a woman being labeled mentally ill and sent to an asylum make it a feminist book? Not if she is. Does a gifted woman writing a harrowing, interesting, well-written novel some kind of achievement for all women? No, although it many be a big step for how literary society views female writers. But that's beside the point, which is the central themes of the book.To me, a feminist book or a feminist anything is something with an agenda, a central theme, calling people to stand up or portraying something preeminent as just or unjust. None of that appears in the Bell Jar's central themes: desperation, depression, pressure. You could overanalyze the book and say the themes stemmed from a male dominated society, but I truly doubt that society or the women it suppresses were a big enough part of the book to say so. The Bell Jar is, if anything, about an inward struggle to come to grips with depression and regaining an interest in life. I think feminists see the beauty of this book and want to assimilate into their agenda. Sorry, no strings attached here. Just a good, thought-provoking and, most of all, moving book."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"&quot;The Bell Jar&quot; is many things. When you read it in your teens, like I did many years ago, it's a survival manual on how to get through the idiocy and incomprehension of other people. When you're a bit older, it's a harrowing and scoriating tale of mental breakdown, given extra edge by the public history of its author. When you're a bit older still (I am now about the age that Plath was when she wrote it), it suddenly reveals itself as not just an artful novel but a frighteningly funny one as well.Even Plath's best poetry has been criticised for occasional glibness, and I have to agree. The sardonic drawl of parts of &quot;Lady Lazarus&quot;, for example, doesn't move me like I think it's supposed to - Plath not quite on form can sound like a more extreme, free-verse Dorothy Parker - and the jackboot rhythm of &quot;Daddy&quot; goes on a few stanzas too long, like one of John Lennon's more doggedly sincere creations. Plath's most brilliant poetry has a pure surrealism, a mythological quality, light years from this obviousness.However, in &quot;The Bell Jar&quot;, her liking (and talent) for cracking black jokes is in perfect sync with her panic and her fear of emptiness. This novel takes bitchiness to epic extremes - it's hyper-bitchy, it's suicidally bitchy. The flat, pale tone is always rendering things with the painful vividness you get from the early stages of a migraine. I laugh out loud at Buddy Willard's pathetic attempts at seduction (&quot;Esther, have you ever seen a man?&quot;), and I also hate him for not being more stylish, for being such a smug, humourless prig. The fat medical student who smirks &quot;At least your mother loves you&quot; is a tiny, unforgettable, unforgivable cameo.Esther on boys is whipcrack lethal, and this is both funny and part of her tragedy. I'll never forget the &quot;bitter, hawk-nosed Southerner from Yale&quot; who comes on all weatherbeaten and streetwise and then writes her a letter saying &quot;he thought he might be really able to love me, I was so intelligent and cynical and yet had such a kind face, surprisingly like his older sister's&quot; - Esther's reaction is &quot;so I knew it was no use&quot; and she breaks off relations with him.The reason this book isn't your average memoir of a depressed girlhood is that Plath wasn't just the wannabe journalist that Esther (and dozens of imitators) have been, she was an exceptional poet. The underlying sensibility is obsessive, mythological, not novelistic. Plath/Esther has an incredible sensitivity to brute Things, but she doesn't relish them or get curious about them the way a Nabokov would - she experiences them as weapons directed against her. New York at night is not a fun place full of happy people, but a lonely hell of &quot;tropical, stale heat&quot;. The UN Secretariat building is not a place where people work but a &quot;weird, green, Martian honeycomb&quot;. The feverish style of the first half of the book is stunned into calmness in the second half, when Esther is institutionalised and has had ECT; but it does its work in putting us right inside the spiked, angry cell of Esther's mind.&quot;The Bell Jar&quot; is a one-off. Plath's other fiction is trivial next to it. It gets better on rereading. I'll probably always turn to it sooner than the poems; for all her demons, Esther is good company, and her story is told with great truth and great artfulness."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"As one who suffers, somewhat, from ADHD, reading books have become a chore for me. Sylvia Plath's THE BELL JAR has always held a fascination for me, given my existential love of Dostoyevsky and others, but it is one I have only read bits and pieces of, from time-to-time.This audio book, read by Maggie Gyllenhall, literally \\"blew me away\\" with its over developed sentences woven by Ms. Plath, woven in such a manner as sugar crystals cross and re-cross each other as they form cotton candy at the county fair each fall in the small Southern neck of the woods where I was raised. I had heard of Ms. Gyllenhall, and knew of her movies, but I was not prepared to listen to such an exceptional audio interpretation, read in a manner that captured the essence of Ms. Plath's downward spiral into insanity.The words are sheer poetry, with metaphors written upon metaphors, in such a manner that enhances, rather than confuse, the spirit of the book and, and an almost innate understanding of what she is going through. While one wishes, hopes, prays, that she'll get better, the reader remembers, with sadness, how this allegorical account of Ms. Plath has no happy ending....If you haven't read THE BELL JAR, or even if you have, and you have seven plus hours to immerse yourself in a great undertaking, do buy this audio book and reflect upon a pleasure one gets from hearing a true wordsmith write of the confusion she along must deal with called \\"life.\\""},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The hot steam rising off the streets of New York City and the buzz of the Rosenberg case emitting from the radios and televisions laid the foundations for the fragile construct of what became known as Ester Greenwood's Bell Jar. It serves as a euphemism for the period in Ester's life that captures within its confines her gradual breakdown. Ester Greenwood was an aspiring, appraised writer who was sent to New York for a month long internship at an esteemed women's magazine, an opportunity which ensured her job security in the future, fine clothing, food, and accommodations, and the opportunity to work with a renowned editor by the name of Jay Cee. In a situation devised to launch Ester's burgeoning career and future, Ester breaks down to the point she can no longer read, write, or function. What brought about such a decline in what appeared to be such a firm, confident woman?Sylvia Plath eloquently paints the decline of Ester Greenwood in the novel because it is a self-portrait of her life and her past. The revolutionary work depicts a witty, insightful caricature of Sylvia Plath and her deep, dark struggle with accepting the role of a mother and wife, fulfilling society's expectations. Ester's rebellion against the confines of the female spirit entraps her in the Bell Jar, a world that restrains her from attaining her intellectual and career goals. This invisible barrier leads Ester to thoughts of suicide and self-deprecation. Her relations with her family, friends, and lovers are caught in the web of her confusion, and as the web become more complex, Ester's thoughts become darker and she plummets further into oblivion.Plath so expressively elaborates the decline of Ester and constructs the perfect conditions for her downfall. From the setting of the hot, steamy, bustling New York City streets to the calmly eerie street her mother lives on, Ester's surroundings depict her own feelings and state of mind. She begins in a state of confusion but relative bliss in her plush New York City hotel, to isolation and dreary thoughts of various deaths she could incur while staring out the window alone in her mother's quiet house. Ester's talk about alcoholic beverages additionally gives insight into her state of mind, when she goes from craving soothing, cooling drinks that appeal to her like vodka, to craving a wet and depressing drink that \\"tasted more and more like dead water\\".The honesty with which Plath portrays Ester, stripping her down to flesh and bone, exposing every daring, suicidal, morbid thought that dashed through her mind, to her random revelations, allows for anyone to find some channel to connect with Ester. The confidence of the reader is won over by her modesty and frank nature, making them vulnerable to her spell. Under the pseudonym of Ester in The Bell Jar, Plath paints the inspiring and intriguing story of a renaissance woman. In every sense of the word she is a woman; she resisted male domination and spun a raw, uncensored and unsweetened depiction of the effects of society on a young, defenseless woman."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This wonderful, semi-autobiographical work is one of the best out there. It is a very intriguing look at a young woman's descent into madness. THE BELL JAR explores many interesting facets of human personality and raises questions regarding what is &quot;sane&quot; and what is not. The book is intellectually stimulating, yet an easy, quick read. I would readily recommend this book to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I read the Bell Jar for my term paper in a literature class. i was literally blown away by Plath's work. she tells a story very similar to her own. i found many similarities between Esther and myself, excluding the depression. Esther was willing to break the mold, but she did not always realize it. i enjoyed this book so much and would recommend it to anyone, especially teenage girls like myself. i would also recommend her poetry. i have found that reading the poetry as well as the novel help to create a better understanding of Plath's life."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Sylvia Plath has a uniquely brilliant voice. Her disciplined, careful, quiet and emotional language makes The Bell Jar a masterpiece. It is both disturbing and understated; remarkably so when one considers the subject matter and the fact the this story is autobiographical in nature. Esther is a young woman blessed with talent and intelligence, and the means to exercize them. We gather that her life has been basically happy and satisfing. But privilged young women, perhaps especially privilged young women, are not immune to mental illness. We follow Esther through her increasingly distorted perceptions, which are vivid and accurate descriptions of a depressive's world. The treatments are almost as bad as her illness. But by the end of the novel, Esther is on the mend. Things are looking up; the dark journey Plath takes us on ends with a vision of light. This is made especially tragic as Plath herself committed suicide. Esther got through it, but Sylvia didn't. Anyone who has been lucky enough to never experience a major depressive episode will find a new perspective about mental illness in this book."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"**This contains spoilers**I read this book, finally, after it being recommended as a must-read from several people. We're pretty good about not spoiling books for one another, so I really had no clue what the book was going to be about when I began reading it. I did have a vague feeling it was a feminist book for some reason, but no solid backing on that information. I knew it was considered a classic to some, and those were the general reasons I began reading this book.The book starts off with a somewhat distant teenager / young 20-something living in NYC with various other girls her age who have won a writing contest for a summer internship. While Esther seems like any other distant and socially awkward person, this fact seems to drive her farther and farther away from reality. The book describes her going through some rough happenings in NYC, but nothing that makes the sudden turn she takes from function human being to needing to be committed to an asylum in just a few pages.The insulin therapy and electric shock therapy she receives reminds me of Exley'sA Fan's Notes. I feel that he describes these horrid experiences more realistically, where as Esther seems to be dreaming the whole time. I'm sure the personal demons she was facing were driving her out of touch with reality, as were the treatments, but Plath seems to be keeping something from the reader.I couldn't help shaking the feeling that she was not revealing the whole truth about the situation, which is fine - it's her novel, not mine. But even the way the book ends, with Esther going in to face the asylum's exit committee for her interview and just stops, leaves me feeling unsatisfied as if more could have been said to help the reader understand the issues at hand. The length of the book even seems to be tied in with this as well, being fairly short it seems more could have been discussed with the reader about her life after the interview.I enjoyed this novel more than I did not, but I would not recommend keeping it on that must read list. I just really don't understand what the big deal about this book is."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"A classic isn't a classic because it has reached some measure of perfection on the page, but because it has resonated with more people on a deeper level than most other books. And that is precisely what makes this book burn. It's not that everyone loves it, or that it has a happy ending (it doesn't), but instead, it has a transcendent tangibility about it - it can be universally felt and related to by those who slip between its pages and stay awhile. And feel it, they will.The writing is seamless and smooth; Plath knew how to write. She knew how to get her troubled spirit to materialize long enough to photograph it for the page. The combination is dynamite, a subtle, understated, gut-wrenching explosiveness which leaves a trail of smoke in the reader's psyche far too long; you won't quickly clear your soul of this book."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The Bell Jar is nicely written, and why it didn't receive unanimous acclaim when first published ia curious, but might be due to the high standards of literature in that era. Interesting as a description of mental decline, the book also incorporates ideas that became familiar only decade or so later: themes such as antipsychiatry, alienation, feminism, existentialism, and psychological self-description. In contrast, the writing style is very classic. Also interesting is that Plath does not, as is often the case, romanticize her adolescent depression--she is not a pining Young Werther with a truer insight or a more engaging personality because of her disorder. It is painful, not an increased source of insight. The plot is well known-a thinly veiled story of then collegiate Sylvia Plath interning at Mademoiselle in New York one summer, and thereafter, her decline. Even at the books' beginning, it is apparent that Esther Greenwood, the Plath character, is injured--we learn more later about reasons. The detached, delicate, actually at times rather funny prose conveys her detachment--a dissociated woman aware, always ironically, of a talent that she now can't exercise, of her declining appearance, of her estrangement from any real relationships. She has an increasingly derealized perception of her world. Parties, meetings, and boyfriends come and go, and she registers all with a documentary self detachment. Assaulted sexually, she does not record the emotional pain, only a growing nehilistic emptiness. She goes through the motions, with boredom or disdain and as the internship progresses, so does her dissociated disdain. She tolerates then rejects her once worshipped boyfriend at Yale, now seen as dull and insufferable--as are many of the men (excpet her dead father), and, indeed, most of the women. After her internship, she is rejected for a writing workshop and this hastens her decline. Her mistrust and perplexity broaden--the patriarachal medical establishment, the world of wealth and privelege, the peculiartieis of other patients, her erstwhile friends. Her present self regardsg her former self as another person. Yet even while in an asylum and confused, the implacable narrative style continues. Plath, to her credit, was, in this book, extending the language of self-described deterioration. Her state is enhanced by the writing style-in the conventional or classic literary style of a more talented or sensitive soul observing a debased, insensitive world in which she only a marginal participant, and superior to--the world of wealth and entitlement, of elite schools, of libidinous peers, of fatuous authority figures, and smallminded neighbors. That this is a coming of age book for females has often been cited, and this style of perception is seen in many of those types of books--the young sensitive antihero who doesn't quite fit in, is romantically depressed, and has a finer vision. I thought the best part of the book is its literary qualities: its description, exactitude, and even wit--and the sense that Esther really is a pleasant and humble person underneath. Her devotion to writerly values is evident in the plot-the hastening of her decline after rejection from a writing workship, and the presence of the one true, uncriticized heroine, and older wealthy woman writer. Damon LaBarbera, Ph.D"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"[3.6/5.0]Esther is an extraordinarily gifted girl. Pretty, intelligent, and talented, she has qualities and accomplishments anyone would be proud of, anyone, that is, except her. This novel is about Esther's (and Plath's) descent into a deep, dark depression that is likened to being trapped in a bell jar that separates her from the rest of humanity and from living a normal, happy life.Esther is a bright overachiever who made straight A's her whole life and received a full academic scholarship to college. Because of her intelligence and writing ability she is invited, with 11 other girls, to be a guest editor for a popular fashion magazine for a month. The girls are treated lavishly and get to live an opulent lifestyle only a privileged few get to enjoy. Having lived in poverty her whole life, she should be delighted at being elevated to such elegant and lavish living, in the heart of New York City no less, but she is unable to enjoy her new position. In the book Esther says \\"I felt very still and very empty, the way the eye of a tornado must feel, moving dully along in the middle of the surrounding hullabaloo.\\" The hullabaloo being New York City, boisterous and lively, the eye of the tornado is her, empty and lonely.During her paid internship Esther becomes very critical of herself, which is typical of depressed people. With all of her accomplishments, she acutely notices only her and other people's faults.This novel is also a commentary on conventional society. Esther wants to be a poet, writer and a professor and feels stifled by the domestic role women are supposed to play during the 1950s. She finds it hypocritical how women are supposed to be pure while men sleep with as many women as they desire.The first half of the book is sort of fun, but there are signs of her deteriorating mental state. The second half of the book deals almost exclusively with her mental illness and her descent into a dark, frightening world. When she returns to her mundane home after her internship the bell jar quickly descends over her, suffocating and trapping her. Cutting all social ties and future plans, Esther gives in to her overwhelming despair. Experiencing insomnia, an inability to read or write, and extreme depression, she decides suicide is her only option. After numerous suicide attempts Esther ends up in an asylum, which ultimately saves her life and returns her to a state of normalcy.After a while I started to dislike Esther because she is selfish, cruel, and extraordinarily judgmental; but I guess she perceives the world around her \\"through the distorting lens of a bell jar,\\" and it's very difficult to have a positive view of humanity when you are completely miserable. Only towards the end of the book does she begin to view the world positively and the bell jar is lifted, however temporarily that may be, since in reality Sylvia Plath tragically killed herself at the young age of 30.The reason I gave this book 3.6 stars is because, although it is well written and poetic, I feel like Plath was holding back her talent. Later, when Plath was talking about her mental illness, shock treatments, and her experience at the asylum, she said they were \\"A time of darkness, despair, disillusion--so black only as the inferno of the human mind can be--symbolic death, and numb shock--then the painful agony of slow rebirth and psychic regeneration.\\" Only very rarely, if at all, do you find any writing as beautiful and complex as that in the book. I read the above line 4 times to let its beauty and meaning sink in and only a few times in the book did I reread anything because the sentence was deep, aesthetic and complex. Another thing that bothered me was that Plath rarely described her own subjective suffering. The book was mainly just her opinions of other people, descriptions of the environment around her and her superficial reactions to events that occur. I didn't feel like Plath dove deep enough into her agonizing internal suffering. One thing one must keep in mind is, when writing an autobiography the author is constrained by the events that occur in one's life, where as in a completely fictitious story, like the last book I reviewed, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, the author can create all sorts of interesting and fantastic scenarios, which really bring a story to life. I think that is one of the reasons why I grew bored and impatient with the book at times."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This book is great. It is so nice to see a book written in this time period, about the time period. The sad story in this book gave great insight into the treatment of women, both in normal society and in mental institutions. It painted a clear picture of what was typical of women at this time, such as typical schooling, dating and sexuality in relationships, and \\"normal\\" behavior.As someone interested in entering the mental health field, it really shows the changes that have been made to the health care system and how some people were stuck in the system based on their lack of funds and availability of skilled and caring doctors."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"After hearing so much about how good this book is I decided to buy it and read it for myself. The story follows a young college aged female who was very successful (the character had won writing awards and one big one that allowed for her to go to New York) into the confusion of a nervous breakdown. The breakdown documented what happens in the 50's so there is also alot of contrast with how women were supposed to be with how she wanted to be. Sylvia Plaths character Esther Greenwood often is flummoxed about how to go about living her own life within this stiffling atmosphere. She is close to finishing college and is wondering her lifes path. Some of the stiffling issues that aggravated her nervous breakdown had to do with 'not being pinned under the thumb of a man,' ie, having kids was often a way to kill ones career, public life and academically pursuits. Eventually she goes through treatment and sorts through it. There is also a weird 'having sex for the first time' incident that goes on and describes how closeted homosexual and homosexual tendencies were then. The work is semi-autobiographical and follows the authors life very closely. I also didn't expect it to be funny, especially in the beginning and towards the middle and end it tapared into a wry humor that I liked! Very good and interesting book."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I am not a mental health professional, and I claim no expertise in that field. I know this book speaks to many people about gender issues, and I'm sorry to give that short shrift, but I read this book from the standpoint of somebody who's had a person close to me commit suicide. It has been a while since I thought about this book, but I saw a friend's Goodreads review recently, and just coincidentally the Human Resources dept where I work has lately been active addressing suicide prevention. I can't help wondering what this book says about the experience of depression. That statement may be simplistic; depression may not be a single entity, but a constellation of different conditions with similar symptoms. I've read some distinctions between \\"psychological\\" and \\"biochemical\\" depression. The biochemical category makes sense, but the more I read about \\"psychological\\" depression, the harder it is to believe anybody really knows what is meant by that term. Maybe it just represents forms of biochemical depression that haven't been elucidated yet. Maybe what seems like a \\"psychological\\" component is just incidental. Legitimate grieving or life stressors may lower the threshold for biological depressions to declare themselves, but may not actually cause depression. From my lay perspective, this seems to make intuitive sense, because we read about people like Anne Frank or Loung Ung, who faced horrible and prolonged psychological assaults, but did not seem to be clinically depressed. I presume it's because they had no biochemical disposition towards depression. If Anne Frank isn't a case against the existance of psychological depression, I don't know who is.One form of biologic depression involves insufficient Serotonin. That's a neurotransmitter, a chemical responsible for signal transmission in the brain. Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors like Prozac or Zoloft treat depression by increasing the concentration of Serotonin at brain nerve endings. Plath's metaphor for her depression as a bell jar makes perfect sense in this context. She compares her life experience to the rarified atmosphere under the sealed glass dome of a vacuum pump. It seems like she was trying to tell us that her depression wasn't situational at all, it was a perception of some kind of insufficiency. I have to believe this distinction was important to her. After all, the title of the book is \\"The Bell Jar\\", not some reference to any of the situational stressors in her life. As I look at the suicide prevention materials from work, it bothers me that there is no mention of this anywhere. I'm sure what is listed here has some merit: risk factors, warning signs, recommendations, etc. But there's nothing here about comparisons to suffocation, or a vague sense of smothering or insufficiency. I wonder whether anybody has ever investigated that as a warning sign or risk factor for suicide."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Most exciting book I've read in ages. I have been looking into all the literature of Sylvia Plath, and by reading this auto-biography type story, the veil of all her poetic work lifts up. Also recommended for teenage readers."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Slyvia Plath did something in literature many other lesser writers would kill to do. She used strokes of light and shadow to capture a living archetype in all of its dreadful beauty and fragility - something almost unnameable but close to us in the world within which we live. But she went furthur than that. She saw herself through a glass darkly and within the archetypal she discovered a person. Archetypes are archetypes but persons are an entirely different order and magnitude of being.I have a hard time describing to myself what the actual nature and greatness of \\"The Bell Jar\\" is. It exists in a place where mere mood becomes something objective and transcendent; a place where our words fumble about on the fringes of counciousness to describe a face that is so achingly familiar, lovely, terrifying in the richness of its capacity for self-destruction. Not a whisper is soft enough to capture the delicacy of the portrait of Esther Greenwood. Her cynicism is sad and accurate. When I think of Plath herself peering out through Greenwood's too wise and too hopeless eyes I am reminded that there is a state of being that is neither sane nor insane - it is hyper-sane marked by a terrifying lucidity possessed by only a few people in human history: Jesus Christ, Simone Weil, William Shakespeare, Sylvia Plath herself, of course, in her poems also, such as in the last flower she offered up for our inspection \\"Ariel\\".Plath's lucidity is knowing. She knows herself and she sees something in the world, something that can hardly be spoken but also cannot be refuted.The great American writers of the Twentieth Century are Flannery O'Connor, R. A. Lafferty, William Faulkner, Ralph Ellison, and Sylvia Plath who gave herself to us completely but only for an hour. Only her ghost remains and it will haunt us until the end of time."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Many don't undersatnd why the character of Esther goes crazy but I kind of do. I have been and am still partially in the same place as Esther. I'm not exactly depressed, or crazy, but I do have my moments when I feel useless and better off dead. That is why I loved this book so much. I've always felt very alone in my feelings, and this book proved to me that I am not the only one. That I am not alone. At the same time this book also angered me in the fact that Mrs. Plath leaves us the readers completely hanging at the end. Does she get out? Does she go back to college? Does she ever get married? And what exactly did the doctor fix after her encounter with Irvine (I'm trying not to reveal too much)? Overall, I think everyone should read this book. Whether you feel like the character in the book, or you may know somebody like them, I think this book can inspire more understanding with people. I really don't like using the terms crazy, insanity, or even depression when describing what it is Esther suffers from in the book, because none of the above really describe it. I know, because I feel it too, and none of those terms describe me. At least I don't think so. And now I know there are others out there who feel the same as I do thanks to this book."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Before I began reading &quot;The Bell Jar,&quot; my father warned me: &quot;That's one depressing book.&quot; I pressed on anyway, and in a matter of two days, finished one of the most honest and touching books that I have ever read. I saw myself in Esther Greenwood, a young woman of my age who finds herself nauseated at the increasingly narrowing path down which young women in the 1950's are being led. Her candid observations about sex, her peers, the city, her school, and her family, echoed thoughts that I have often entertained in my own mind. Esther has little interest in being a mother and living in the suburbs--she is not even certain that she wants to be married. It is for her refusal to accept the role that society prescribes to women that she is rendered crazy by her mother, her peers, and her doctors. If Esther Greenwood is indeed crazy, then I wonder about the mental health of myself and many of my friends. I propose that it was not Esther's mind that drove her to attempt suicide--it was a confining society that kept her from feeling free enough to explore her own interests and goals; and being understood by her mother and the other people who loved her. &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; spoke to a generation of women who would come of age in the 1960's, and would help to give them the confidence and the courage to change the world."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Before reading &quot;The Bell Jar,&quot; I read &quot;Ariel,&quot; Plath's collection of poems that really address the climax of her depression with such great poems like &quot;Daddy&quot; and &quot;Lady Lazarus.&quot; But it was only after I read &quot;The Bell Jar,&quot; that I truly appreciated Plath's genius and sophistication as a writer. One of the reasons Plath was such a genius was her command of the English language. &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; does not read like a novel, but more like prose, which made the book a quick read.&quot;The Bell Jar&quot; tells the story of Ester Greenwood, a young woman interning at a woman's magazine in New York City. The reader fully witnesses Ester's decent into depression and her institutionalization in a mental hospital. Like her poetry, &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; is semi - autobiographical and very emotional. Plath also leaves the ending of the novel ambiguous, I do not want to give the ending away but I will say this, do not expect any sort of resolution.All in all, I would recommend this book to Plath fans and those who appreciate a clever, wonderfully written piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The bell jar by the highly acclaimed writer, Sylvia Plath -who is famous for her number of poems- is one of my favourite books. It is a dark and rather disturbing novel; autobiographical to some extent and provides an insight to her and her feelings in a metaphor.You will be empathetic towards the narrator and main character, Esther Greenwood, a young adult who succeeds her way into university in New York. At the beginning, she was ambitious and witty, and like Plath, Esther is an excellent writer. In the summer of her 19 years, she works as a junior magazine editor at her internship and she introduces her friends and many situations that contribute to her final breakdown, as she gradually declines to insanity as she feels being trapped in the bell jar. She is later admitted to a mental institution, where she'll shares her experiences with you. The rest you'll have to find out.The book jumps from time to time where she'll recall past events abruptly, this was quite confusing, but after the first couple times, I got the hang of it. There are some humour in this book that breaks the ice, mainly a bit of dark humour once a while. I thought the ending was rather ironic, as after a month of the book being published, Plath had committed suicide...Plath's poetic language and technique is what makes this novel unique, her ability to describe the details of a situation with similes and put every word together that made it so honest and real. She was able to convey the images and feelings of Esther and lets you in her world to portray mental instability. I also found it hard to separate Esther from the author of the book. This book evoked strong feelings from me when I read it. It is an emotional story and can somewhat be life-altering."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The BELL JAR is a remarkable autobiographical piece: like the fictional heroine Esther Greenwood, Plath went to New York to work on an internship, and discovered the seamy reality lurking beneath the cocktail parties and the piles of eligible men. She finds herself retreating into despair, frustrated with her own inadequacies, as well as the constricting world around her that forces her to play certain roles - for example, as an eligible partner suitable for a procession of insincere men, or the perpetual virgin keeping herself \\"pure\\" for an ideal marriage partner.THE BELL JAR also struck me as a remarkable comment on contemporary cultures - specifically the recreation of New York mediatic culture so beloved of successful television series like MAD MEN. When we look at the characters in that show, with their slicked-back hair, immaculately pressed suits and frilly dresses, we're transported back into a world which - for the program-makers at least - seems so much more attractive than the grimy reality of contemporary America. Viewers are invited to experience pleasurable nostalgia for a vanished world. Plath reveals the grimy reality lurking beneath that world."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Thought I wouldn't like it but couldn't put it down. It shows mental illness for what it really is...a disease, not a choice."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I've never felt compelled to review a book. Though, after reading some of the negative reviews here, which admittedly, are few and far between, I almost feel obliged to share my two cents.Okay, so to those of you who've complained about the book not having a plot, let me put a question forward: Does your own life have a plot?Although - as far as I understand it at least - this book is not totally autobiographical, it is closely twined with Sylvia Plath's actual life. This being so, the story isn't going to run along a straight line so that the reader can peripatetically meander down humdrum lane; it's not going to pave a path while mapping every corner or hold your hand while you turn each page. It runs true to how life is, and it does so beautifully. Beyond beautifully. It does so with sincerity, complete candour and devastating insight. This, for me, trumps any book bearing a contrived plotline, regardless even of how magnificent that plot may be.Second, Syliva Plath was severely depressed. If you felt that Esther's character lacked depth because her actions / thought processes made no sense; then frankly, you're a poop head. The whole issue with depression is that it makes no sense. Its effects are not grounded in logic and thus make it impossible to provide \`reasons' or justifications for why Esther felt and lived and acted in the way she did. I can't help but feel that your issue is not with the book itself, but rather, with depression. Maybe, if you did some research into the bleak facts that bed the ground depression flowers from, you'd have enjoyed reading this masterpiece much more. It will indeed allow you to appreciate the complexity of layers that Esther's character possesses. And if it doesn't, well, that's your problem.Finally, aside from The Bell Jar providing for a small slice of English genius; aside from The Bell Jar totally absorbing its reader into the malevolent, chimerical void that it conjures; aside from the fact that it doesn't necessarily have a strictly defined plotline, the Bell Jar posits as a beguiling venture into the spirit of a severely depressed human being. And further to this, it allows its reader to swim in pools filled with the proverbial tears that are shed from all people who experience this crippling, juggernaut of a psychosis. I mean, isn't this what classics are made of? Raw engagement?This really is one of the best books I've ever read; right up there with 1984 (my ultimate favourite). I can't recommend it highly enough. Just read the damned thing."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"What can I say that other reviewers have not? I just wanted to also add that this is a fascinating and gripping novel following one woman's descent into torment and mental illness. The novel is taken mainly from the events of Plath's own life, merely changed slightly to protect people's identities and to change the setting slightly.The novel is so well written and so honest that one cannot help but be moved."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"When I began this book I really didn't know what it was about, even though I knew a bit about Sylvia Plath's life. I was very shocked as I read on and found myself completely emotionally involved in Esther's life. It's a very gripping read, and one that I (a 19 year old college student studying english!) identified with muchly.At first it was hard for me to understand Esther's shift from being somewhat &quot;normal&quot; if not a bit apathetic, and suicidal depression. But if you read closely, the answers are there. I think Plath writes in a way that is very straight forward and without excessive emotion. She lets you react to her work without trying to force your ideas in one direction or another. Esther feels she has to kill herself: she gives a few reasons but doesn't try to persuade us that what she's doing is right or noble.She chronicles not only her own descent into depression and madness (which is written wonderfully -- we're as caught up in her own shattered perception as she is) but also the terrible psychological views of the time as well as treatments (lobotomies, electro-shock therapy), the stigma surrounding depression/madness, expectations for women, and the burdening pressure society has on young hopefuls. It's a wonderful story that is what it is and leaves you to make up your own mind. Even if you don't enjoy it or understand it, The Bell Jar is an important step in feminist novels, understanding psychological disorders, and literature itself."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Personally, I could relate to this book in so many ways. I could understand the frustration that Esther felt as she struggled to deal with the pressures of society despite her own feelings of inadequancy. After an attempt of suicide, she is placed in a hospital where she is isolated from the norms of society. While there, she learns that she does indeed have inner strengths and the ability to cope. She emerges from the hospital ready to face the world head on.This book brings even more meaning with the knowledge that the author, Sylvia Plath, dealt with many of the same issues in her own life. It has been speculated that she wrote this book more as an autobiography rather than a work of fiction because of the many similarities. But tragically, rather than gaining courage and strength, Sylvia Plath committed suicide not long after this book was published. It's almost as if this book was her cry for help, a plea that went unanswered."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This book ranks as one of my top ten favorites. You don't have to know Plath's writing to like this book, but it helps. Her novel is as electrically charged and moving as her poetry is.

After I read this book, it took me a while to figure out how much this book affected me. The book may seem strange in the way it is written. The plot seems flat at certain parts or unbelievable, but the reader should keep in mind that this book is based strongly on Sylvia Plath's life. Although not everybody will be affected by the book or will relate, it is definitely an important book to read. If a person really wants to get into the book (look past what's on the pages), I strongly suggest you read more about Sylvia Plath's life and read her poetry. You'll feel more connected to what's going on and understand more what she was going through."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"When I read Sylvia's story for the first time I could feel her pain!Her descriptions of all the hospital tortures she went through made me wince.I reccomend that if you have any idea of who Sylvia Plath was that you read her novel, in her own words. It will move you."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This novel is a must read - period. The way the author takes you into Esthers depression and brings you through each step of the way is just brilliant. Even as a reader, you realized she was in deep and every justified thought was turned around to show just how deep in she was. Its amazing and perfect. If you have ever gone through depression, then this book will amaze you in ways you could never imagine, because things you once couldn't understand or comprehend... you see in the book and suddenly it begins to make a bit more sense. You relate to it - pointing out certain parts saying 'I've been there...' or 'Thats how I feel...' and through to progession of the book, realize just how bad 'there' really is.I love this book to death and I highly recommend it to anyone who is ever remotely interested in it.I won't lie... the beginning was a bit confusing and made you wonder about certain things but by the middle you are caught up inside the book and you will never regret reading it."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"We thought the book was an interesting perspective into the mind of the depressed. It allowed us to see the despair and struggles facing those with mental illness. It followed Esther though the beginnings of her disease though recovery, allowing us to better understand this process. We liked Esther's use of analogies (such as the fig tree) to explain her feelings toward her life and her world. Esther also seemed more than just a character in a book - she felt like a real person to which one could relate. One flaw in this book is how it sometimes jumps from scene to scene, past to present, with little warning, leading to confusion. Some things were also vague and unexplained, such as Esther's insulin shots and other incidents and characters. Overall, this book was an enlightening and educating experience."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Anyone who can fault this work based on entertainment valueAnyone who can fault this work based on entertainment value is a fool.If you are talking to me about pages and events then I can clearly see how you missed the point. Of course this only gives me greater insight into what is wrong with the world today. If you are in search of a good read only, then just move on, because, while yes, you will most certainly find it here, but if that is all you are in search of or find, then you already truly missed the boat.This piece of work is the true definition of sharing. This is a person who passed 5 years prior to my birth and I feel as if I know her. Not only is this book well written, but also it is written with her heart and soul.I know that this was a book written to make money, to allow a writer to keep writing. But true to Sylvia's style, it is a deeply personal book that sheds a lot of light on her actual life for the person reading between the lines, or for the person who actually cares.If you are looking to have a better understanding of depression, and how it works, then sign up for a class. If you have to ask if there is a point, then you clearly wouldn't know the difference either way. If you think that reading a lot of books makes you an expert then you are a sad case.This book is about making connection with the person who wrote it. True, you shouldn't feel obligated to like everything that some one writes just because they are a literary genius, but to dismiss it as if it were a Dean Koontz book with a bad plot only shows the lack of depth within your own cranium."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"What else can possibly be said about this book that hasn't already been said since it was published in '63? It's fiercely personal, it's scary as hell, it's laugh-out-loud hilarious. Plath has the ironic first person voice of Esther Greenwood down cold, and her dark sense of humor is what makes this book so much more harrowing. What amazes me most about reading the Bell Jar now in 2002 is how modern it seems. Plath was way, way ahead of her time."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This is probably my favorite book ever. As a self-diagnosed bipolar, cynical, angry teenage girl I can say that Sylvia Plath puts what millions of us feel every day into exactly the right words. [...] But then I read it again. And again. Probably too many times. Plath knows exactly what she is talking about, this book is heartbreaking and personal. It's like Catcher in The Rye with a poetic Franny as the main character, only Ester's way more [messed] up than Franny."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This is a brilliant first person account of the experience of having a mental disorder (including very exact descriptions of schizophrenia, back before it was widely known of in the 'sane' world, and before it was transformed into entertainment fare by the makers of the filmed 'A Beautiful Mind') and what contributed to its occurrence. Made all the more horrible and disturbing by the the fact that this is practically an autobiography (with fake names) and that Plath did not end up making it out of the illness alive. She killed herself not long after this novel was finally published."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Sylvia Plath is an amazing author. The fact that she relaesed such an intimate time in her life to be praised or ripped apart by critics shows she was not afraid.

This novel is just beautiful and dark at the same time looking into the soul of a girl that we can all relate to. The language is dark and disperse and somehow full of hope. Too bad Sylvia Plath did end up committing suicide at the age of 30. If she had lived and survived I think she would have been one of the most influential writers of all time."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I love books about psychiatric hospitals or mental illness. Sadly, this book was very dry and just a very slow read. I found myself having to force myself through the book."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"It is an odd adverb to choose when talking about mental illness: beautifully. But one of the things that makes a fiction piece beautiful is its showing ugliness while still touching the heart. It makes you say yes, this is true. It brings both ache and a sigh. That is beauty.This is an excellent book that captures the downward spiral of mental illness at a genius level. It is so odd that Plath initially published this book under another name because she was not proud of it. But I guess that is understandable since she suffered from mental illness herself."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I put off reading The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath first because everyone in college had read it and it just seemed cliche. Then I put it off because I was worried it would scare me with all the craziness inside. It's not scary, but perhaps in the mundane and normal way she is insane it is more scary than if she was a true nut. Because that means I could be just like her.The writing is beautiful, simply beautiful. Such normality made into such vivid imagery. The change in Esther is so gradual and yet so prominent. It begins with moments of silence and then strange sounds. It becomes utter calm almost to the point of lethargy. Then she just gives in to the fact that the world is monotonous and she doesn't want to deal with that.Some of my favorite lines from the book:\\"Every so often a beam of light appeared out of thin air, traversed the wall like a ghostly, exploratory finger, and slid off into nothing again.\\"\\"It dazzled and danced with light like a heavenly ice cube.\\"\\"Wrapping my black coat round me like my own sweet shadow, I unscrewed the bottle of pills and started taking them swiftly, between gulps of water, one by one by one.\\""},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The Bell Jar, written by the late Sylvia Plath, is like an unstoppable ride on the tracks of depression; the momentum is building up so quickly, so even if one wanted to jump off the tracks, it is too late. The only way out was suicide.Sylvia Plath wanted to become a writer. Her first job was for a magazine in New York; she chronicles her experiences in her novel. Although she wrote in a pen name, everyone in the literary community knew The Bell Jar was her novel. She had literary success for her poetry. And her husband was another writer; but he was an errant husband and jealous of his wife's success.She wanted desperately to have The Bell Jar published. Publishers were critical of her manuscript, saying it was infantile and not literary. They felt it was more of a memoir than of a piece of literature. She had been in and out of psychiatric hospitals, and had electric shock therapy.She and her mother had a strained relationship. Her father died when she was young, and she missed him and mourned her loss. Her mother did not want the manuscript to be published, as she thought Sylvia had made hurtful statements about people who tried to help her; but Sylvia was too far gone into her deep depression.So basically it is a chronical of her fictional character's feelings and experiences masking her own life. Although I normally do not like a stream of consciousness style of writing, her lapses of memory, problems with transitional elements or inability to continue with a thought provides the reader with the insight into the mind of a tortured soul.In the book she attempts, but does not commit suicide. But the audience is told that she becomes a professor of literature in England. She was already divorced and taking care of two children. I forget the name of a famous writer's home in which she resided in England, but she had chronic sinusitus living in a dank house.The day of her death she made toast with butter and tea and placed it in the children's room. She opened their windows, then taped the bedroom door shut. She went to the kitchen and turned on the gas. The children were saved, although I heard recently that one of her sons committed suicide.Her husband had the rights to her manuscript. He was trying to honor the wishes of his mother-in-law. However, boot-leg copies were already being passed along, some reaching the States. A savy publishing company was able to gain rights and start publishing immediately.The movie made with Gwyneth Paltrow and Daniel Craig was pretty close to the book. Obviously this is not a fun book. But if one is in the field of psychology or interested in stepping into the mind of someone else, then this novel is worth reading. Some people compared the works of J.D. Salinger to those of Sylvia Plath. I would recommend reading the novel due to it's controversial content and make your own opinion about the novel."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I simply wanted to add to all these great book reviews, that the voice of Maggie Gylenhall is absolutely perfect for this audiobook, and that it makes it all the more enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Although I can't remember how long ago, I have read The Bell Jar before. Upon re-reading, I was surprised that I remembered absolutely nothing about it -- literally, not even the first thing. Anyway, it's good, although it's hard to separate the book on its own merits from the knowledge that it ultimately functions as a prologue to the tragedy of Plath's real life. Plath was, at heart, more of a poet than a novelist, which is evident often enough in her prose. Her descriptions are lovely - and yes, at times, even poetic - and always minutely observed. She is also a sharp observer of human nature, the essence of which she can portray with a minimum of words. Buddy Willard only requires a page or two before you understand just what he is, and the same can be said for many of the characters in the book. Buddy, with his conventional outlook, is part of the cause for the narrator's malaise, as she tries to figure out what she wants to be in the world, and opposes that to what the world wants her to be. Plath's book ends by offering us the chance to imagine a hopeful reconciliation for those possibilities. We take it, of course, and for a while in her life it appears that she did too, accomplishing what she wanted to be in the world, as well as a part of what the world wanted her to be. It didn't \\"stick\\" though, and if you don't know what happened next, you might want to pick up a biography when you put down The Bell Jar."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I've never been good with my words, so I will try my best to review it. The Bell Jar gave me a familar feeling when reading it. We follow Esther's slow decent into insanity, and we feel for her as we helplessly tell her that everything is going to be okay. I love that the book ends bitter sweet, that it's not a feel-good ending but it does wring out whatever hope the book may have possessed (which isn't much). Whether it was Plath's memoir or not, the fact remains that we see a tortured artists' view point onto what the world really looked like to her, through Esther. I will never get rid of this book."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"A poetically written account of a young women's decent into depression and psychosis and her journey through rehabilitation and self actualization.

Thank you"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This book was really funny and really honest. But that's what I liked about it.It was kind of frustrating because you just wanted the main character to snap out of it. I know mental illness is serious and these people cannot help themselves from feeling the way they do, but it was really frustrating because I do not share her same opinions about life and I try really hard not to be so helpless and reliant on other people to fix problems in my life. Also she talks a lot about the burden of being a woman. I think just because women have the challenge of giving birth, it is really a gift of closeness to our mothers and ancestors that nobody can take away.Just like some people never find real love, I think Sylvia takes her emotions for granted. Like she's supposed to feel great all the time. Being a genius sometimes means being more sensitive and vulnerable to feelings of depression, but that doesn't mean she should give up. Because in the end everyone dies. We're supposed to share our sympathy for humanity, but Sylvia doesn't really care about anybody but herself because she's so alone and afraid to reach out.All in all, I don't think this book has a positive message. There's a difference between honesty and helplessness. She's kind of helpless."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"A review???

I read this book last fall and I could not wait to read a chapter every night before I went to sleep. Plath was a genius, first I read all her poems and then immediatley purchased The Bell Jar and I was fascinated with the story of Esther. This book is semi-autobiographical. Esther's world is turned upside down when her depression sinks deeper into thoughts of suicide. She resents her mother, wishes her father was still alive, and is rejected for her writings. The passage that frightened me the most is when Esther loses her virginity to a much older man, the way Plath describes this scene gave me chills and even the chapter where she tries to kill herself by slicing open her wrists made me a bit nauseous.

Sylvia Plath writes in a way that it can make the most vivid pictures in your mind seem so real. And it is also written in an almost poetic way. You can almost feel Esther cutting her calves. This book especially caught me because Sylvia writes from her own life, from when she slowly fell into a deep depression, became metally ill, and eventually comitted suicide herself.

After an incident where she disappears for a week, she checks into several mental institutions.

This book is mainly targeted for high school students."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The Bell Jar, by Sylvia Plath is the story of a young woman who progresses into a condition of serious mental illness. The book begins with Esther, the main character and narrator, having some very troubling thoughts. She is obsessed with the mental image of the execution of a couple convicted of treason. Esther recalls this part of her life as the beginning of her illness and a time of losing control. During a month-long stay at an expensive hotel in New York, we discover that Esther does not identify with any of the other young women who are staying there. She feels alienated from and inferior to them. When Esther becomes sick with food poisoning, she stays in bed and does nothing. She seems to be comfortable with being physically ill because it seems logical with her mental state. It gives her an excuse to lay around and do nothing, which is what she really wants to do. She is also able to avoid being around the people she doesn't fit in with, the wealthy young women. She is more comfortable being alone in bed than she would be dealing with others. When Esther is invited to go on a date with Constantin, she starts remembering a relationship she had in the past with Buddy Willard. She was more interested in what impression she made on the other girls in college than she was in a real relationship with Buddy. By going out with Buddy, she thought she would fit in better with the other girls. When Esther decides to go out with Constantin, she plans to lose her virginity believing this would make her more independent. When things don't work out with Constantin, she decides that she never wants to get married because that would stifle her ability to write poetry. She imagines that marriage would restrict her. After a very frightening encounter with another man, Esther goes back home to Massachusetts where her illness begins to get much worse. She hears her own voice as a zombie voice and is losing touch with reality. She goes to see her doctor who sends her to a psychiatrist. When Esther goes to see Dr. Gordon and shows him a paper that she had written in childish handwriting, he prepares her for electric shock therapy. The treatments are painful and Esther no longer trusts Dr. Gordon. After this, Esther begins to plan her suicide. Her death is the only thing she thinks about. When Esther takes an overdose of sleeping pills, she is sent to another hospital in the country. At this hospital, she meets Joan, an old friend from college. Joan is suffering from mental illness as well, but doesn't appear to be as sick as Esther. When Esther does finally succeed in losing her virginity, she ends up with serious bleeding and must be treated in a hospital. Esther has a hard time understanding why her body is injured. She thought this would make her independent, but instead, she is more convinced of her problems. While she is recovering, she learns that Joan has committed suicide. Esther is very disturbed by this because she thought Joan was in better shape than she was. After this, Esther realizes that a relationship with a man is not important to her. She feels she doesn't need this kind of relationship to be well. But when she leaves the hospital, she is concerned about how long she will be well before her symptoms begin again. This is what she calls the Bell Jar. Her illness makes her feel like she is trapped in a jar and she doesn't want to go through that again."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This book really captured me, in more ways than one. It is an an autobiographical book taking place in the 1950's about a nineteen year old woman named Esther Greenwood, who was staying in New York City for bing picked to go to a meeting for young journalists. There were many other women there too, and she made a few friends. From the time she arrived, she was slowly getting worse mentally, but no one realized it...not even her. She had many trials in her lifetime that led up to her breakdown. First, her father died when she was nine, leaving her with a mother and a brother, both of which she hated. She lost some friends. To make it worse, her first &quot;love interest&quot; betrayed her. All of these things made up her life that she hated to live. She ended up in many institutions, and she ended up hating all of her counselors. One put her into shock treatments, and the treatments scared her so much that she hid everytime she heard those words, fearing that it would be her that had to go through them. The other tried to help her by making he talk to her mother, whom she could not stand. She finally ended up confessing that she hates her mother and she always has. From that point on, she felt free from everything. Her first &quot;love interest&quot; ended up getting TB and got very sick. His girlfriend, Joan, ended up in the same institution that Esther was in. This upset her very mich. She was never close to Joan, but when Joan was found drowned, her patents called Esther and told her that she was one of Joan's best friends, and they asked her to come to the funeral. Esther went, and it was a whole new beginning for her. From that day on, she progressed a lot. She finally ended up getting to go home and she tried to lead a normal life.This book by Sylvia Plath was actually written about her own experiences as a nineteen-year-old girl in New York City.

It was interesting story about Esther trying to be healthy(in mental means) again after attempts to suiside. This gives readers, especially people who have depression, hope to readers that \`This is not the end, so don't give away your life so easily.'Also the title of \\"Bell Jar\\" which is compared to Esthers mind that was closed and not letting the hope to come in and keeping the despair among herself.Eventhought you think that you will not have any mental diseases like depression, after you read the book, you wouldn't feel safe that a person like Esther was also having depression that she tries to end her life.

This is the story of a young woman in the 50's who did not fit the mold of what society at that time dictated that a woman should be. She could not accept this, and in the beginning, it was hard to feel sorry for her because it seemed she gave up too easily. She wanted to be a writer, she didn't get into the writing class, and instead of taking some other course and trying the writing course again later, she gave up and slipped into depression. Esther's character was starkly contrasted by the other successful women characters. There were women doctors, women psychiatrists, women editors. Surely these characters also had gone up against the same pressures and societal dictate that Esther experienced. Yet they overcame their obstacles whereas Esther succumbed to defeat. The book was fascinating and every well written. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"&quot;The Bell Jar&quot; is definatly one of the most impressive books I have ever read. Sylvia Plath talks about how she gets depressed and eventually tries to kill herself. This book is bound to leave it's mark on you, and it is definatly recommended for anybody who liked &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot; by Susan Kaufman; &quot;I Never Promised you a Rose Garden&quot; by Joanna Martin(?), &quot;Lisa, Bright and Dark&quot;, and Sylvia Plath fans. The story starts in New York City, where we meet Esther (Sylvia Plath). Esther has been chosen by a magazine to work for a month at the magazine to learn about writing. Esther has &quot;adventures&quot; in New York, and after her month with the magazine is up, she returns home. There she learns that she has been rejected by a university for a writing course that she wanted to take, and she doesn't know what to do with herself. It is here that she realizes that there is something wrong with her, and many other events unfurl, such as her visits to a psychiatrist that performs shock-treatment on her incorrectly, until finally she overdoses on sleeping pills. After this she ends up in a mental institution, and she finally &quot;gets better&quot;. Towards the end of the book, she says that she hopes that the bell-jar of despair does not fall over her again. The sad thing is, that it did fall over her and that is how she died. This book is incredible, and there is nothing bad to say about it. Sylvia Plath is a great writer, especially because she speaks from experience. I highly recommend this book to anybody who is considering buying it."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I picked up this book purely out of curiosity. I wanted to see how someone with mental illness was able to construct such a well-known novel and in the end found that I was deeply impressed with the skill of Plath's writing. She is very talented in her use of words and I found the book engaging to read.I assume (because I have never ready any other book like this) that it's a rare thing for a book to capture a glimpse into the thoughts of someone that is mentally ill. I was expecting a fragmented and disjointed writing and was surprised that many of her experiences and thoughts were reminiscent of other women at a post-college age--perhaps, to an extent, even my own. Thoughts of inadequacy, self-doubt, and direction-less-ness often plague young adults and Ester showed all of the symptoms that coincide with \\"growing up.\\" Of course her problems run much deeper. Caused by something that I cannot figure out and that society is still looking for answers on. Plath's real life story is a tragic one and you can only hope that books like this can help society find the answer to lifting the bell jar.All in all I liked this book. I found there is a theme to the books that I enjoy most--female heroine and time period setting. Like Francie Nolan growing up during the depression (A Tree Grows in Brooklyn), Cal Stephhanides with the riots of Detroit (Middlesex), I very much enjoyed reading about the experiences and thoughts of Ester Greenwood in mid-1950s New England.The forward of this book mentioned that 80% of female poets suffer from mental illness. I was astounded by this number. In today's society you don't really hear about sanatoriums, asylums and the shock therapy that was depicted in the book set in the 1950s--today you hear about anti-depressant medications and sessions with psychiatrists. It was interesting to read about how mental illness was treated."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The latest production of Sylvia Plath's classic novel, the BellJar (seven hours, seven CDs, unabridged, Caedmon audio/Harperaudio) is amazing piece of audio literature.Most of the previous productions have been abridged or overdone . . . and this unabridged version is better than the other versions I have heard. When the original book was written . . . depression was hinted about . . . suicide was swept under the rug . . . mental breakdowns were whispered behind closed doors and never spoken aloud.Actress and first time narrator Maggie Gyllenhaaltakes this book \`s text and wins out the listener slowly, as thebook progresses.

From what I saw, many of the reviewers saw Sylvia Plath's semi-autobiography as a have-to-read classic, or as well written. Ouch. I think Sylvia Plath would be spinning in her grave to here such dry words about her one and only novel.I suffered from severe depression. I could not find words to give to the doctors to describe all of the feelings that go along with the illness. So one day I brought in my copy of the Bell Jar, and I pointed out specific parts that echoed the madness in my head. I am not making this up as a sappy story. Sylvia Plath's writing is so real to me, that it has always held a special place in my heart.So, lets say you are not crazy, and can not have such a visceral experience as I had. Read The Bell Jar. Plath's words are so powerful, the poetry that fills each page is so strong. I will admit that I got mildly disinterested near the beginning, but (dont want to give to much away) all of the events that lead to the pivotal point in the book, and all the of events that follow, are charged with electricity and passion. This is a woman's fight for life, and everyone should pick up a copy to enhance their own."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This special novel passively sat on the bookshelf in my study for sometime. Over the months, occasionally, it would wink at me... I would pick it up, thumb through its pages, read the odd line or two, and place it back on the shelf. On a Sunday morning last week, I read the beginning line for the first time:\\"It was a queer, sultry summer, the summer they electrocuted the Rosenbergs, and I didn't know what I was doing in New York. I'm stupid about executions.\\"Needless to say, I read ~The Bell Jar~ from start to finish, and have had a suspicious and disturbing dark cloud hanging around me ever since. This dark cloud mingles with intermittent light, but the shadow of the novel's themes moves into my vicinity like a suspected stalker, waiting in the corner, seemingly ready to pounce without warning. This may well sound a tad too dramatic, but their are novels out there that have the power to influence your state of mind in profound ways. This novel, for me at any rate, turned out to be one such book.The story is a realistic account of a young American girl's descent into madness.Similar to many great American writers, her prose style is deceptively simple. Plath's writing is extraordinarily translucent, enabling the reader to vicerally connect with her inner most thoughts and feelings. This aspect of the novel was highly enjoyable rather than the actual story itself. Sometimes reality is difficult to look at...As a poet, Plath is acutely sensitive to the world, and as sensitive people are forced to do, they create social masks as a defence mechanism against the vulgarities of existence. This reminded me of the Aestheticism of the Irish writer and poet, Oscar Wilde: the poet's task in life is to be a seeker of beauty - the art of life, or the life of art, the aesthete or poet equates with a form of purified ecstasy that can flourish only when removed from the vulgarities and sterotyped world of actuality. In the case of the novel's protagonist, Esther Greenwood, it was a confrontation and eventual withdrawl from the vulgarities of 'male culture'. The mask she created revealed itself as an unkind, almost flippant attitude to the people around her. Because she must be true to herself, (as poets must be) her actions or inactions with the people around her caused tremendous guilt, thus the vicious circle begins: an acute sensitivity to the world and self; the creation of a false mask as defence; the inevitable guilt for not being true to oneself, leading to eventual self destruction.There are no knights in shining armour in this tale. Sir Galahad riding over the hill on his trusty stead to save poor Esther Greenwood from herself and others. On the contrary, most of the major male characters in ~The Bell Jar~ (apart from her father who is dead) are pathetic losers: coarse, insensitive and self absorbed.~The Bell Jar~ Plath's only novel before her tragic suicide, thrust her directly into the feminist arena, making her a feminist 'icon' in American culture. This accolade is well deserved as this book is a major contribution to the cause, exposing male dominance and oppression, (more so then, fortunately, than now) and illustrating that women are not simply baby machines, cooks, house cleaners, and mere objects for male sexual gratification.After finishing this book, I couldn't help making a comparison to Viginia Woolf's modernist masterpiece, ~Mrs Dalloway~. In this novel, similar themes are explored: male vulgarity, the arrogance of the medical profession, and madness.This is an important book for many reasons, least of which is its literary contribution to American letters.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The overall theme of this book was human suffering. The author explored themes related to this, such as the human mind, struggle, suicide, and young women's positions in society during the 1940s and 50s: more specifically, how this society refuses to take women's aspirations seriously. However, the general theme and certainly the best explored idea of this book would be human suffering and madness. The author explores this well, probably because this was an autobiography. Sylvia Plath obviously understands at the deepest level the theme of this novel; it being a theme in her own life. First Plath explores how suffering begins and develops in a person. In this book, it is not actually clear what brought on the main character's terrifying internal battles and descent into madness. But the development is portrayed clearly; the stages of self doubt turning constant feelings of having no worth whatsoever. The character (as Plath calls herself, Esther) accuses herself of being useless in a society that has no place for her. And so begins a spiraling, quick decline in this young woman as she descends into a life of self mutilation. Throughout this novel, Esther contemplates suicide frequently: \\"But when it came right down to it, the skin of my wrists looked so white and defenseless against the blade of my Gillete that I just couldn't do it.\\" However, after following multiple attempts at suicide, Esther finally manages to overdose on enough sleeping pills as to land herself in the hospital. Shortly after she is sent to a Psychiatric Ward, where it is expected Electroshock Treatments will cure her depression. After endless, blurry days full of pain and misery, her condition improves. Esther is released from the Ward and is almost herself again. Around this time in her life, Plath completed the book The Bell Jar and produced a plethora of poetry, all astounding pieces of work. By this time she was married to a poet, Ted Hughes, and had two children. Although she was said to be hopeful and optimistic during these days of her life, on the morning of February 11, 1963, Plath ended her life without explanation. This book conveys a journey of an individual's personal experience with human suffering. The theme is well explored by the author, to the extent where the novel was criticized for being hitting the reader with such disturbing impact. I, as well, found this novel to be disturbing. Sylvia Plath dug deep into the landscape of the human mind and eloquently portrayed darkness, disillusion, and despair."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"i remember reading plath's poems in highschool...never quite understanding them. feeling bored by them. but this book...if you've ever felt yourself clawing at the edges of your sanity, this book will hit you in the gut."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"In an English class taught by an instructor I can now with impunity call a pompous fathead, I was assigned this book and had to write six pages about what I found to be its meanings. After taking some deep, slow breaths to control my rising nausea at the memory of all the affected, egotistical people who went on and on about the message of this book, I went home and delved into Ms. Plath's (always a Ms. when you're dealing with this woman, she's NEVER Mrs. Hughes, no, no, no) take on her own mental collapse during her years as a college student. I looked forward to this like a trip to the dentist, but within 20 pages I was into this story of a brilliantly intelligent, multi-gifted, crazier-than-the-average-loon young woman from the 1950's, who struggled to live up to the high expectations others set for her, imploded into mental illness, and rose again after a course of therapy that included electroshock treatments.I read through the early pages of Plath's humorous and falsely sedate story of her trip to New York after writing a winning essay in a magazine contest, her life and times as a university honors student, and her concealed revulsion at the man she was supposed to marry. Then the imagined \\"bell jar\\" of the book's title \\"descends\\" to imprison the young Plath, and she spills into madness. Plath ceases to sleep, eat, bathe, or communicate with anyone outside her own bedroom. Her well-meaning but bumblesome mommy tries to chide her seriously deranged daughter back into good behavior but succeeds only in driving Plath into assuming a fetal position in the earth-smelling space under the house. The seriousness of her daughter's state finally sinking into her head, the elder Plath summons help and Sylvia is sent to a progressive mental facility for a harsh but ultimately successful course of treatment.The book takes us through some of the horrors Plath endured in the hospital, and there are numerous cringe-worthy descriptions of exactly what it is like to experience shock treatment. (Ce n'est pas agr&eacute;able!) After Plath emerges from the center in a state of relative sanity and functionality, she returns to her studies and courageously frees herself from her unwanted engagement. Later, with a MOST unfortunate side effect, she loses her virginity to a professor, and thereafter till the book concludes, broods on the deepest fear of her young life, that the \\"bell jar\\" will descend once again. (Which it eventually does, of course, in the next decade, culminating in Plath's suicide.)Incidentally, in my paper, I took the position of her creativity (as it later emerged) partially arising from her suffering, and that Plath the poet of eventual cult status would never have existed had Plath the college student not endured the pains she did. Oops, seems that was not what Dr. Fathead was looking for, so I got a B. Nope, the correct and only answer for an interpretation of this work is that all intelligent women are automatically societal victims and Sylvia was saying that and only that in The Bell Jar. Unfortunately we can't ask Plath what she meant or indeed if there was ANY theme, cause she stuck her head in a gas oven and forfeited the right to speak for herself. So why so many agree with the victim/poor us message Fathead advocated as the ONLY correct impression to take away from this pre-modern classic defies my understanding, but I still liked The Bell Jar a lot more than I was expecting to and hope anyone who reads it gets to do so with the luxury of finding his or her own take on this unsteady tale of mental illness and survival."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The Bell Jar is not for everyone. It's one of the most incisive, beautiful, horrifying journeys through mental illness ever printed. Anyone who has never suffered from depression or any great life-changing event may not get the point. They cannot fathom the meaning because they have no frame of reference. This is not a criticism of those who have dismissed the book, but simply my point of reference after bouts of crippling depression and being on the receiving end of well-meaning but ineffectual comments like \\"Distract yourself with some useful task,\\" or \\"Look on the bright side.\\"The point is that when you're in the throes of depression, no fortune, trip around the world, award, love, gorgeous weather, or satisfying work looks remotely bright. Some days it's all you can do to take a shower. Life looks black, hopeless, and utterly without meaning. A person who has never stayed in bed all day and read on a beautiful day because the world outside looked too terrifying may also mistakenly believe that depression is a trendy euphemism for laziness, self-pity, willfulness, and self-obsession. I assure you, it is not.To dismiss Sylvia Plath's book as worthless because it doesn't have a plot is really an unfair criticism. Not everyone wants to look at the darker side of existence, but for those of us who seek meaning from it, this is the perfect book with which to begin."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"My family read this book together so we could discuss it, and after having read it, our feelings were mixed.Mom found this book utterly boring. She said she could not empathize with the main character, and didn't care what happened to her.Dad enjoyed the imagery, and said he would like to read some of her poetry. He also enjoyed her observations, which were at times witty and clever. But he felt the book was lacking.Then there's me. I really enjoyed The Bell Jar, finding it to be a real page-turner, even if not the greatest book I have ever read. After reading the biography in the back of the book, I have to think that Esther Greenwood and Sylvia Plath are one and the same.One interesting point of The Bell Jar is that it can be interpreted in many ways, but one doesn't have to TRY to interpret it in order to understand and enjoy the story. That is, it can be read on many levels.The content of this book is at times shocking, so I would steer the very faint of heart and children away. It's a good, easy read, and it paints a picture similar to Girl, Interrupted or One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. If you like a good, psychological study, you might want to read The Bell Jar. I also suggest The Bell Jar to a book discussion group, as there is plenty to talk about as the story moves along."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Sylvia Plath was one of the most gifted young poets of her generation. ARIEL, by far her finest work, was completed just days before she committed suicide in 1963 at the age of thirty.More widely read is her novel THE BELL JAR, written between 1958 and 1962, and published only six weeks before her death. Less a novel than a thinly fictionalized memoir of her first suicide attempt at age twenty, THE BELL JAR has become a feminist manifesto supposedly chronicling the frustrated hopes of a young woman held a virtual prisoner by an uncaring society.Plath's posthumous adoption by the feminist movement largely obscured the fineness of her writing and the truth about her life. As her daughter, Frieda Rebecca Hughes has acidly observed, Plath became a \\"suicide doll\\" for an intellectual movement seeking real-life martyrs. This turn of circumstance has long frustrated readers and critics who wish to assess Plath on her own terms.It is clear from a close reading of THE BELL JAR that Sylvia Plath was a complex, brilliant, unbalanced, creative and ultimately self-destructive person. On the one hand it is tragic that Plath ended her life before antidepressant drug therapies came into use, possibly regulating her lifelong history of extreme mood swings; on the other, medications may have subdued the brilliance and passion that underlie this book and the ARIEL poems.As THE BELL JAR begins we find young \\"Esther Greenwood\\" spending a summer in New York City as a student \\"guest editor\\" at a major women's magazine.Plath spares no effort in underlining the fact that this experience, with its exposure to the broad but not always genteel cultural and social mileu that is New York City horrifies Esther, an overprotected suburban girl to the tips of her well-shined saddle shoes. What another girl might find exotic or exciting about New York, Esther finds utterly repugnant.Her innocence leads her into several unpleasant encounters with men, and several scathing confrontations with the other girls in her group as well as the editor of the magazine, Jay Cee, whose pointed comments are almost uniformly unkind.Plath admittedly caricatured and lampooned real people throughout THE BELL JAR, cruelly and so much so that she published it under a pseudonym, \\"Victoria Lucas\\" in Britain, and felt that it should never be published in the United States. Her mother, with whom she had a symbiotic and mutually supportive relationship, appears in THE BELL JAR as a thick-headed ogre, largely blind to Esther's travails.Esther herself is a supremely gifted but supremely self-involved person whose constant internal dialogue effectively blots out much of the world around her. She is far less sensitive to the wants and needs of others than to her own feelings, of which even the most transitory or irrational are paramount. If Plath's Esther is a caricature, then she was the most cruel of all to herself. If Esther is an honest portrait, then Plath presents herself as a temperamental overachiever and a person who neither liked others nor was particularly likeable, at least at age twenty.Esther is like many depressed young people. She is unable to see any way out of her immediate unhappiness other than killing herself. Her contemplation of self-destruction, the actual attempt, and her long, slow painful recovery are recounted in searingly sad detail. The writing is simple but poignant.Throughout the book Sylvia Plath/Esther Greenwood laments that she is heremetically sealed within a bell jar, unable to have meaningful contact with life. Esther freely admits her terror of choices. To choose one path is to allow all the roads not taken to darken forever.These are thoughts that pass through every young mind, but they have rarely been committed to paper so well. GIRL, INTERRUPTED by Susanna Kaysen (which very coincidentally takes place in roughly the same era and in the same private psychiatric hospital) is but a pale shadow of THE BELL JAR.Dredging all this pain and reexamining this time in her life may not have been the best personal choice for Sylvia Plath, whose bell jar did descend again, and with finality. Plath fell into a deep depression during the writing of THE BELL JAR. Her personal life collapsed. She became increasingly isolated from those around her, even while she wrote the poems of ARIEL in a white heat, sometimes at the rate of two a day. She finally succeeded in taking her own life on February 11, 1963."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Walking In Her Shoes - A Review of \\"The Bell Jar\\" by Sylvia PlathThe fact that I read and review so many books is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, people often assume I am more knowledgeable about literature of all kinds than I really am. So, I am often greeted with, \\"You surely must have read \`Bel Ami' by Guy De Mauppasant!\\" Then, I have to mumble words of apology for my Neanderthal lack of sophistication and admit to not even having heard of the book! On the other hand, I get to add \\"Bel Ami\\" to my list of books to read!It was just such an interchange about books-worth-reading that led to my decision to pick up a copy of Sylvia Plath's, \\"The Bell Jar,\\" from a used book table in Greenwich Village. I was vaguely aware of Plath and her tragic life, but did not know many details of her story and her one novel. She lived part of her life just around the corner from the location of my office in the town of Wellesley, so I felt a geographic connection to the author and to her overtly autobiographical novel about a young woman's descent into madness and despair.I felt another connection, as well. She recounts in vivid detail her experience, as a young woman, of undergoing electroshock and insulin shock treatments - the treatments of choice in the 50's for those experiencing a \\"nervous breakdown.\\" As a child, one of my favorite people in the world was a great aunt who had endured the same kind of mental roller coaster ride that Plath narrates so hauntingly. \\"Dedda,\\" as she was know within the extended family, lived a life in many ways in parallel with that of Plath and her fictional alter ego, Esther Greenwood. As a young woman, she suffered a nervous breakdown, attempted suicide, was hospitalized, and underwent a series of debilitating shock treatments.Reading Plath's plangent account of Esther's journey through hell allowed me to feel that I was in some manner walking in Dedda's shoes. She has been gone for almost twenty years, but I think of her fondly every day. And I think of her fondly because of a significant difference between the path that she walked and the one that Plath ultimately chose to follow. Rather than succumbing to a despair that would lead to a successful suicide attempt, Dedda turned her experience with brokenness into a driving passion to reach out with compassionn and love to other broken souls. The second half of her life was a frenetic sprint to touch as many lives as possible - often sacrificing sleep and a normal schedule in order to find enough time to visit the sick, bereaved, distraught, unhinged and institutionalized. She became my role model for networking. But, I digress. More about Dedda and her remarkable life another time. . .One of the themes that jumped out at me from the pages of Plath's novel was the all-encompassing sense of strangulation that Plath felt as a young women growing up in an era and a culture that delimited the roles that a woman was expected and allowed to assume. She despaired of becoming someone's wife and mother - only to place within the suffocating isolation of a bell jar her brain and her career aspirations.\\"I tried to imagine what it would be like if Constantin were my husband. It would mean getting up at seven and cooking him eggs and bacon and toast and coffee and dawdling about in my nightgown and curlers after he'd left for work to wash up the dirty plates and make the bed, and then when he came home after a lively, fascinating day he'd expect a big dinner, and I'd spend the evening washing up even more dirty plates till I fell into bed, utterly exhausted.This seemed a dreary and wasted life for a girl with fifteen years of straight A's, but I knew that's what marriage was like, because cook and clean and wash was just what Buddy Willard's mother did from morning till night, and she was the wife of a university professor and had been a private school teacher herself.\\" (Pages 68-69)Stylistically, Plath chose to write the first paragraph above as a single, run-on sentence - emblematic of her feeling that she envisioned that such an existence would be nothing less than a life sentence of cruel and unusual punishment.I am not sure, as a white male, I will ever be able fully to appreciate the frustration of what it must be like to have one's choices in life narrowly delimited by one's gender or skin color, but Plath's claustrophobic \\"Bell Jar\\" takes me a few more steps down that path towards understanding. For that reason alone, this is a book worth reading, reflecting upon and sharing with others.Al"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The TunnelThe phrase, \\"there is always a light at the end of the tunnel\\" is not always true. For some, the tunnel only continually grows darker. This reflects in Sylvia Plaths work. Her novel, The Bell Jar, brings readers through the mental breakdown of protagonist, Esther Greenwood. Unlike other classics such as One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest and The Catcher in the Rye, Plath establishes a much more in depth look at the psyche and what happens when it collapses.Esther Greenwood, a writer temporarily living in New York, moves back home where she gradually starts to lose mental stability. Finally, she sees a psychiatrist. He recommends Esther \\"should have some shock treatments at his private hospital\\" (135). After several attempted suicides, one almost fatal, Esther goes to a different hospital where she slowly recovers with insulin and more shock treatments. After the suicide of her friend, Esther slowly begins the return to her previous life.The story is given more substance and reality once one takes a look at the author. Sylvia Plath admittedly based most of the book on her own experience with mental disorder. To conceal this, the book was originally published under the pen name of Victoria Lucas. However, one can perceive the obvious reflections to her life present within the novel. While she spent six months hospitalized, so did Esther. Sylvia also went through several shock treatments like Esther. However, while Esther's attempts to kill herself failed, Sylvia took her life in 1963.Overall, the novel is extremely effective in its purpose. Plath skillfully employs point of view to portray Esther as a relatable character, includes potent sentences to contribute to different themes, and uses her writing style to illustrate mental instability. The story, from a first person perspective, lends a more personal feeling to the work and helps the reader identify with the protagonist. Plath also has a knack for including powerful ideas within short lines, \\"I would rather have anything wrong with my body than something wrong with my head\\" (182) and \\"To the person in the bell jar...the world itself is the bad dream\\" (237). She also uses several situations to reveal other important topics, such as religion when Esther explains how \\"what each person believed, happened to him when he died\\" (202). Relationship issues also arise, \\"I didn't know who would marry me now that I'd been where I had been\\" (241). Plath also breaks up her chapters. She often jumps from one topic to the next without any major transition. At times, days, and sometimes months will have gone by in the span of two lines. This ambiguity to Plath's writing provides the book with purposeful inconsistency which aids in the understanding of Esther's disorder.Perhaps it is because of this writing style that the book is considered a classic. It also shares many of the same qualities with other classics such as One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and The Catcher in the Rye. However, The Bell Jar encapsulates the idea behind both books, and holds everything they lack. The dissatisfied, young Caulfield holds many of the same qualities that the confused, depressed Esther does. Holden's desire for purity in the world echoes in lines like \\"The longer I lay there in the clear hot water the purer I felt\\" (20). Although, what Salinger leaves to the assumption of the reader about depression, Plath states directly, \\"That morning I had tried to hang myself\\" (158). This straight forwardness conveys her message in a much stronger way. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest's inclusion of insanity becoming reality also mirrors Plath's work. However, Esther as a slightly more sane character than Chief Bromden-the narrator of Cuckoo's Nest- shows readers that anyone can succumb to the hardships of mental sickness.Sylvia Plath is an excellent author who utilizes her style to its fullest potential to produce an amazing novel about the struggle with depression and \\"the bell jar\\" (186). Similar to other literary classics, Plath uses her protagonist to evoke emotion and portray humanity, showing that good literature sometimes lies in the darkened end of a tunnel."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I actually listened to this book as an unabridged book on tape. I had severe reservations about listening to/reading it--I had a manic episode several years ago that rates high among my most painful and embarrassing moments. I thought this book would be too close for comfort and that I would relive some of the most miserable experiences of my life by learning about Syliva Plath's nervous breakdown. The exact opposite happened: I felt self-compassion instead of self-censure. Sylvia describes so accurately what it's like to have a break from reality, to lose self-control, and to descend into madness--while not even knowing what's going on. Esther (Sylvia Plath's autobiographical narrator) also becomes increasingly self-absorbed, one of the hallmarks of a manic episode.One of the worst things about manic-depressive disorder/temporary insanity is that people who don't know much about the disease might assume that an afflicted person is always like what s/he is like when ill and take things at face value--fortunately, this couldn't be further from the truth, and most of us who are susceptible to the disease are very different types of people when we are healthy.I can relate to Sylvia's feeling of being dogged by her breakdown and her need to put it in perspective. It's said that Sylvia wrote \\"The Bell Jar\\" in order to get beyond her breakdown so she could concentrate on her poetry.The Bell Jar distorts perceptions, impairs judgment, disrupts relationships, and looms threateningly over the heads of those in remission--\\"will the bell jar come down upon my head again?\\" Unfortunately for Sylvia, it did. However, her book can inspire compassion for the mentally ill and show how even a gifted young student (who seemed to have the world by the tail) can be vulnerable to this illness--no one can assume s/he is immune to mental illness and/or temporary insanity.NAMI (The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill) reminds us to love the person, hate the disease."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I recently asked my wife to create a list of the ten most important novels she has ever read; \\"The Bell Jar\\" was on her list. I have spent the past two days reading Plath's novel and I come away from the book feeling vulnerable. Plath has created a work that immerses the reader in a dark world in which mental stability is not a given. I feel a new closeness to Plath for the struggle that was her life and for the power and urge that let her transform that into art. She has ceased to be a \\"suicide victim\\" in my mind and has, instead, become a human being.I was initially surprised by the voice of the narrator. It reminded me of Holden Caulfield -- honest, down-to-earth, knowledgeable, caustic. I found Esther immediately likeable and a sympathetic character. Reading like a diary at times, the story tells about simple events (a cab ride, a party, a visit from a boyfriend) told in simple language that frequently shines with such exquisite phrasing that I was forced to step back and laugh or smile or just appreciate Plath's ability to use language in such powerful and meaningful ways. Two examples of this:1. Referring to a picture of Dwight Eisenhower in \\"Time\\" magazine, Plath writes: \\"The face of Eisenhower beamed up at me, bold and blank as the face of a fetus in a bottle.\\" (72)2. \\"I felt limp and betrayed, like the skin shed by a terrible animal. It was a relief to be free of the animal, but it seemed to have taken my spirit with it, and everything else it could lay its paws on.\\" (83)Language and technique made the sad events of the novel seem real and immediate. Plath selects events in a masterful way, telling stories of simple conversations, giving brief insights into the narrator's mind, exposing fears, illustrating pathologies, foreshadowing events.The horror of the initial suicide attempt stayed with me throughout the rest of the novel. The second half that outlines her relationships with doctors and her stays in psychiatric institutions is dreamlike. We abruptly find ourselves in new surroundings, in the middle of conversations. This discontinuity creates a world that mimics Esther's increasingly nightmarish life. As readers we do not calmly watch from a distance; we are thrown into the consciousness of the patient.\\"The Bell Jar\\" was a disturbing book, but one that expanded my understanding of Plath and her work and gave me a perspective on mental illness that I had previously lacked."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"(I'm writing this review years after first reading TBJ, and am not quite as worked up as I was years ago.)Unlike many other readers of Sylvia Plath, I read The Bell Jar as part of a class assignment in grade 12, discovering her prose before her poetry. My first impression of Plath's only novel was one of awe. It's simple style and detached narration make it memorable in that it doesn't muddle the subject matter with melodramatic statements or situations.Sylvia Plath writes of her descent into insanity with such coolness and ease, that it is utterly difficult to see where she actually feels the Bell Jar starting to close in on her. Herein, Plath deftly blurs the line between reality and madness.Anyone who is interested in a classic story, one that is touching and poignant, read The Bell Jar. No other novel I have read so well explicates the human condition as this one does. Wow."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Sylvia Plath's timeless novel The Bell Jar has without a doubt exceeded my high expectations. Her writing is nothing short of beautifully detailed, incredibly creative and downright genius. She, unlike other authors has the ability to keep her readers in such a way that to abandon the book is virtually impossible. Her novel is as smooth and effortless as her poetry. The heartbreaking story tells about the year she tried to kill herself and the inescapable feelings that haunted her, feelings of being trapped and alone - as if in a bell jar. My criticisms for Plath are little to none. The book is at times excruciatingly painful to read, the ideas that went on in Esther Greenwood's head are explained beautifully but are also about death and feeling suffocated, trapped and isolated - they are about sheer depression and the end of her innocence. It is hard to read the chunks in the book when the people that love her make desperately vain efforts to save Esther. And although the book's plot can at times be hard to digest, the writing is so fantastic that it is well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"If you like great writing, you'll like this book. It is honest and direct and evocative and powerful. Utterly unpretentious.This is in no way a book about suicide, the way some people who haven't read it seem to think, though it does chronicle an episode of what must have been the same vulnerability that later resulted in her untimely death.If you like powerful poetry, get Ariel, which contains the poems Plath was writing when she died. I can only read one or two a day, then I have to stop and think about them."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I was inspired to write this review by the number of people who had negative things to say about this book. Maybe it's more of a girl thing or maybe you have to have experienced a little bit of depression on your life. This is one of my favorite books and I think that the imagery is beautiful and fully worthy of a poet. Considering this book is written in the first person it would be unrealistic for Esther to comment on herself. Readers are supposed to understand her character based on the way she sees the world. This is a certain style of writing that not everyone will enjoy, but it was very much in fashion in this time period. Showing, not telling, as many english teachers put it.As far as Esther not accepting help, well what help was offered? Her mother's urging to become a secretary? It doesn't seem unrealistic that an educated young woman would want something more and yet not know to get it, particuarly in this time period. For example my own mother grew up in the same era and has told me that the only obvious career paths for an educated woman were a teacher or a nurse. My mother obtained a masters degree in english, but was not encouraged to pursue a PHd or any career other than a teacher. This book is about a woman who wants something more, but isn't sure what that is, in a society that does not offer many options. That is the key to understanding this book and the reason that it might be difficult to understand through the lens of modern times.The thing that I find the most saddening about this book is that after Ms. Plath made a recovery from an earlier episode of depression, presumably like the one in this book, she went on to experience another episode that resulted in her suicide. Esther makes such an inspiring recovery that it is very sad to realize what happens to Ms. Plath."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"In my neurotic workings to make myself a more literate & urbane creature, i've undertaken a number of the recommended \\"reading lists\\" that have come to plague my life, psyche and bank account. To many of you who have probably already read this novel and are just glazing your brain away at amazon reviews, you will not be suprised the Mrs. Plath's novella graced a spot on many of the said lists. Also, over the years i've always come to notice the books reputation, often for darkness. Naturally being a guy, i've also not failed to notice that the Bell Jar is often a well placed accessory of many if the stylish thinking-girl types.(I swear i've not met a man who has read it, or admits to having read it)So I plunged into it, expecting a maddening, dark tale that would explain the trend of certain girls who like to cut themselves. Instead I was just impressed that i could see the very honest report of feelings of depression and anxiety. It wasn't really dark at all I felt, it just showed well what it is like to be in that realm of detachment and uncertainity that a great deal of youths have found themselves in. I almost hate to say it because i know that it is trite, but the novel makes a good companion piece with Salinger's Catcher in the Rye. The book was enough to make me interested in Plaths poetry as well,(i'm very interested in reading Ariel), and now I feel I can property join the thousands of others who are sad that such a talent was been snuffed out so early and unable to have a full life of work within the realm of American letters."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I am a 35 year old male. This shouldn't matter, but as \\"The Bell Jar\\" over the years has become more a punchline than literature, the fact that I was not a young woman between the ages of 16 and 23 kept me from tackling it. I was pretty sure I couldn't relate. This is a fallacy of my own making. This book IS about being a woman to an extent, but it is also a profound look into the nature of humanity and the often inane way that we just begin to slip and then fall. There are always deeper reasons for slipping into darkness, but the reality is that they are not necessarily clear when we are fighting off the demons. This is where therapists often fail. They need to NAME the cause of the malady, like dianosing you with cancer. Where Plath succeeds most in her book is her treatment of the unknown quality of the downward spiral. Sure, peppered throughout the book there and hints and allegations of potential trauma, but, thankfully, they are not dwelt upon. It does get a bit obtuse in the middle, but it quickly snaps itself back into shape for a very profound final scene. I highly recommend it FOR ANY READER. It is a hell of a lot better than the incredibly overrated \\"Catcher In The Rye\\"."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Like another reviewer stated, I also took this book at face value and thoroughly enjoyed it. Esther Greenwood fascinated me with the way her thinking and actions gradually became more and more bizarre. It sort of sneaks up on the reader.--Let's put it this way, I read it in 3 days which for me lately, means it was a page turner. Looking for a good read--this is a good bet."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Sylvia Plath's, The Bell Jar, is a novel that will take you into the world of Esther Greenwood. A young girl clinging to straws trying to find her place in the world. The language that Plath uses is simple yet vivid, taking you into the mind of a depressed girl. From beginning to end you follow the journey from the unknown purpose in life into something much deeper and much more dark.The sentences start as if in the mind of a sane person and begin to subtly change into the mind of someone with a darkness setting in and leaving you with the eerie feeling that something is happening...but you aren't quite sure what.The vivid language stays with you and the characters that move in and out of Esther's life have a lasting effect on the reader, just as they have had on her.The beginning of the novel starts \\"It was a queer and sultry summer, the summer they electrocuted the Rosenbergs, and I didn't know what I was doing in New York.\\" This simple sentence thrusts you into Esther's life and you will not forget the journey of a young girl sitting in the bell jar trying to escape."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Sylvia Plath was an incredibly bright, feeling person who was terribly disturbed by the ideas lurking in the dark corners of her mind. I think that depression is something that befalls an extraordinary amount of brilliant artists. (Some psychologists say depressed people have it right...which is...comforting when you are depressed but scary all the same.) Through reading these words that Sylvia pressed to paper, you really get an idea of the sadness that plagued her and eventually led to her suicide. She is a wonderful writer and you will feel inspired by her accomplishments as well as quite sorrowful for the life that was taken by a sickness that clearly wasn't treated. Some people seem too intelligent for their own good and she is definitely one of them.Oh, and this book is labeled as fiction but it seems more like an autobiography that perhaps isn't totally accurate."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This book is pretty great. When I first started it, it felt sort of like a female Catcher in the Rye. Esther is a likeable character and a relatable teen in the beginning. Then her journey into a nervous breakdown begins. It is an interesting look into what was most likely Plath's battle with mental illness. I recommend the book. It is a quick, easy read and not nearly as dark as some others seem to describe it as being."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"A portrait of madness written with a light touch. Breathtaking, sad and timeless. A must read for lovers of personal literature of the 20th century."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Reading the Bell Jar I got pulled into Esters world. Sylvia Plath pulls you into the world of a young woman and her slip into depression. In the first couple pages she speaks about seeing a cadaver for the first time, and that is just enough to tweek your intrest. The way she speaks about some things can make you either bond with her or think she is compleatly insane.When I read this book i couldnt put it down and once i finished it stayed in my brain for days. This is possibly one of my favorite books that I've read in a long time and would highly recommend reading it."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The Bell Jar is an insight into a young girl's mind and how life influenced the way she thought and how she acted. It's a very good read because everyone has been upset or depressed sometime in their life and this lets you know that there is someone else out there who is going through the same thing.The prospect of chemistry also plays a major role in the book. Esther, the main character was affected by medicines and the behaviors of others which all played into why she was so lonely and suicidal. The novel goes into amazing detail of the current situation that Esther was in and how she reacted to them, it showed how she developed and grew with her experiences and how she finally overcame her illness. This novel is not only well written but it opens up a fictional character's heart and lets people examine it and therefore fully comprehend what is going on and why it's occurring. It informs people about depression and sparks their interest about it while using immense literary tactics to allow readers to truly enjoy the entire story."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Sylvia Plath was one of the greatest writers to live, in my opinon. And The Bell Jar captures her disturbing brilliance perfectly. I found myself having several things in common with Esther, leading me to question my own sanity. But nonetheless, this book is amazing. Read it and you will not be sorry."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I read The Bell Jar and was amazed. The main character, Esther, was relatable. Of course one must overlook the setting and date. I was blown away by Sylvia Plath's ability to describe the intense emotions that she'd gone through. For one such as myself, who had never come in contact with a person with these issues, I was stunned to, on a certain level, feel I could relate to them. The further you got into the book, the more legitimate you found her ideas. By the time I'd finished, I found myself questioning why she was institutionalized. Plath's ability to make me feel this way truely shows how great a writer she was. I would recommend this to someone in a second, and often have. It is a truely remarkable book."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The bell jar is one of the few, acually the only book I've ever been able to read more than once. Sylvia Plaths writing style is exceptional. The eerieness of reading about a person who is basicly perfect, turning into suicidal chemicly imbalanced loony bin drew me in completly. Though it is not clear when Ester Greenwood really looses it the path she takes is very interesting . My only wish is that Sylvia Plath had lived to write another masterpiece like the Bell Jar."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"In a simple phrase, this book was awe inspiring. After I read the last page, I broke down in tears it was so incredible. I dont think I've ever read another book with such realism and emotion. Silvia Plath truly outdid herself when she wrote The Bell Jar. I laughed, I cried, I felt her pain as if it were my own. Truly miraculous for anyone who lays eyes on it."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The minute I began reading this book, I was captivated. No other book has done that for me and initially I was shocked. I expected a less interesting book than it really was. Usually, I critiscize all the books I read but this one is my all-time favorite. Esther Greenwood opens the book as a normal girl trying to write in New York City. She then spirals downward into her eventual breakdown. Sylvia Plath vividly describes Esther's disease and her road to recovery. I know this is a short description but the book is SO good that I didn't want to say more to ruin it. If you are interested in Sylvia Plath, read this book because it will leave a lasting impression. -Melissa, 14 years old"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"It was interesting and sad.

Sylvia Plath speaks straight from her heart through the main character 'Ester.' Plath's writing style is incredible and she communicates feelings, passion, dispair, etc... better than anyone. As you read, you're like, man I feel exactly that way or I have at some point in my life. The analogy about the fig tree in the book relating to the future of her life is breathtaking. I stayed up and read this all in one night."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I am a 17 year old female and thought that &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; was an excellent book. Knowing that Sylvia Plath actually went through most of the book's events herself makes the story all the more moving. If only everyone could be as truthful as Esther Greenwood! This book is quite indescribable, so you must read it for yourself. However, if I had to compare it to another book, I would say Sanlinger's &quot;The Catcher in the Rye.&quot; Esther Greenwood is like Holden Caulfield's female counterpart. If you couldn't stand Holden Caulfield though, don't let this stop you from reading &quot;The Bell Jar.&quot; The raw emotions this book deals with are so real, it is almost scary to think what society can do to an individual. I read this book &quot;for fun,&quot; not because I had to, and I suggest you do the same."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"&lt;u>The Bell Jar&lt;/u> is a novel that follows the protagonist's insecurities to the point of mental breakdown and treatment. A book specific to the time period of the \`50s, it's easy to see why &lt;u>The Bell Jar&lt;/u> is considered a classic American novel, showing promise to modern literature. Not knowing that Sylvia Plath wrote this book in the late \`50s and early \`60s, one could guess that the novel was composed in the year 2004. The vernacular is plain and doesn't over-achieve the standards of comprehension, the way older books sometimes seem to do. With themes of suicide and mental instability, Plath does a terrific job of staying realistic instead of writing in an overemotional, \\"teenaged\\" way- which is what I liked most, being 16 and not proud of the irrational way teens think. Esther, the protagonist, is mature and logical in her struggles.As to not summarize the book, in short, &lt;u>The Bell Jar&lt;/u> is a perfect example of an understandable, personal American classic. Acting as one of the stepping stones to modern literature, Plath's autobiographical fiction is a work of art you wont forget."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I read this book at the recommendation of friends and a book. I was guaranteed a modern masterpiece and a feminist one to boot. I got all of that. Every woman has a bit of Esther in themselves. We must follow a straight and narrow path in our lives and if we don't we face being branded much as Esther was. We question marriage and we're crazy because marriage has existed for so long. Sylvia Plath has even captured the feelings that many women feel about losing their virignity, the pressure and the fear. The ending is one of hope. She steps into the light, but we all know that there was no happy ending for Sylvia Plath. She died because she never escaped her bell jar and left behind a profound work on the experience of that bell jar. Is Esther really crazy? I can't answer that, but I can say that Esther(and Plath) were feminists and they questioned our society's customs. Despite the tragedy, we're fortunate to have this work. Read it when you're questioning yourself or authority."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"THE BELL JAR is often compaired to Salinger's CATCHER IN THE RYE. There is actually a certain basis for this: both novels deal with youthful characters who are completely disenchanted by the world. But beyond this the comparison breaks down, for where CATCHER is essentially a character study, Plath's BELL JAR presents us with a tightly plotted story concerning a young woman's descent into insanity, and is in my opinion considerably more successful in an overall sense than virtually anything Salinger ever wrote.The novel is largely autobiographical, recounting one of Plath's most notorious mental collapses that led to a very famous sucide attempt. In dealing with this personally volatile material, Plath shows remarkable control, and gracefully walks the fine line between carefully crafted fiction and self-indulgence, creating in the process a modern classic indicative of America at mid-century.Plath herself considered the book simply a commercial &quot;pot boiler,&quot; a project undertaken in the hope of generating some cash. It is quite true that book is clearly written as a popular novel rather than serious fiction; it is also quite true that the book generates enough heat to boil water. But Plath was a uniquely gifted artist, and her talent simply bursts the seams of the genre: the book is possessed of a stunning passion and numerous powerful images delivered in a singularly uncompromising tone. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Let me first say that in rating this novel, I waffled back and forth between 4 and 5 stars. I finally decidedo n 4 stars, but it could just as easily have been 5.Sylvia Plath made a name for herself with her poetry and this, her only novel. She was one of the confessionalist poets, along with Anne Sexton, she studied with Robert Lowell. The Bell Jar carries her confessionalistic work into fiction. This is based pretty heavily on her life. The Bell Jar is like a Catcher in the Rye for girls. It's pretty well written, though you can tell it is an inexperienced novelist. It is a shame she killed herself so young, because not only was she a great poet, but she had such potential to become a great fiction writer. Plath successfully carries us down into insanity with her protagonist. The narration works very well in keeping the reader as disjointed as our heroin (It's similiar to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in that matter, only not to the extreme--and it paints a prettier and more approving picture of the mental health system of the time). We never get a good idea as to why the breakdown occurs, but as in real life, these matters are often confusing. My biggest problem with the book isn't the somewhat juvenile style of writing, but it is the ending of the novel. It seems a little to pat. We don't feel that the narrator has worked through her problems, or that her mental health should be better, it just sort of becomes better. Plath should have spent a little more time working out the ending. But it is a fine novel, one that I enjoyed."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"After discovering that my English teacher shared some of my tastes in literature, I asked her to recommend me another book to read and &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; came up. This is one of the best novels I have read in a long time. Plath's writing is almost poetic, and the overall novel is such a beautiful reflection of her life. Although depressing (the novel almost brought me to tears twice), after reading it I felt a great sense of satisfaction. Although this is a biography of the authors life, this novel mirrors many issues that every young woman will go through, and for this reason, amongst many, I strongly recommend that every girl, teen and woman reads this novel (I'm not sure if the average male would enjoy reading it). Plath obviously puts her heart and soul into her writing, and it shows, so I, as a reader, was able to empathise with the author on so many levels that this novel has left a mark on my mind that will probably stay there forever. *sigh* I'm addicted to good reading..."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I hate reading, and usually have to be forced to read for school, but when I sat down with the Bell Jar, I read the first 150 pages in three days!

It is dark in some ways, but I would not say that it is depressing. It would be more accurate to say that it is disturbing at times, but this facet should in no way discourage a potential reader.The main reason you should read this book is because a powerful and touching story is told. This is, however, only one reason.It's worth reading because Sylvia Plath has a pure voice that rings. She is witty. Her words have punch. She paces words well and she uses words well, precisely. One thing I love best about her writing is its immediacy - she reminds me of how I want to write. She brings the reader right in, with not a lot of prelude setup. And once you scramble a bit to know exactly what's going on and who everyone is, you soon enough you do. It's a small wonder - it's a great way to write.If you enjoyed Catcher in the Rye, I'm almost completely certain that you would enjoy this book - because her tone is the most similar to Salinger's that I have ever encountered. It's a different voice, of course, it's her own, but she shares a certain intangible with him that is captivating.In summary, it's not exactly an easy read because she gives us a lot to digest, but it's a book that's definitely worth the journey."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Though what ultimately happens in this book is something that shouldn't be taken lightly, Plath was able sprinkle amusing incidents throughout the plot that make this book deserving of its &quot;classic&quot; classification.

It is autobiographical in many aspects and covers her attempted suicide. The critics thought this book wasn't as literary as they had expected and I agree that it was more fun than seriously literary. They predicted the next novel that she was in the process of writing would be better in a literary sense but she never finished it before her suicide. I agree that the book is not of the same literary quality as her poems and that this is worth mentioning in a book review, but it was still great and it is a must read for any Plath fan.This novel starts with the heroine's coveted internship with a posh fashion magazine in New York City, and then retracts to cover past aspects of her life, such as college and dating. The story then continues to the heroine's descent into madness, including her experiences with phsycologists and asylums and electric shock therapy.This is one of the best books I have read recently. Parts of it made me laugh out load and other parts made me incredibly sad. The heroine experienced and felt things so deeply, and Plath had a way of making me feel them and experience them along with her. This is a fast-paced and still thought-provoking book that I finished very quickly, and then went back to read some parts again and savor the sweet little details.

As the character starts to fall apart, your reading will become faster and faster. Partly autobiographical, Plath wrote about her falling mental status and what she went through to get out. Anyone with mental illness will fully understand this book, and loved ones should read to get some understanding of how widespread a disease this is."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"A small insight into Sylvia Plath's amazing mind, this novel charts the path into psychosis for a young women. Touching, sad, interesting. This is a great book for anyone interested in the human spirit."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I chose to read &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; for my junior year term paper book. It appealed to me, because, scarily enough, I could really relate to many of the thoughts, dreams, and aspirations that the book's heroine, Esther Greenwood, had. I found it to be a story that, while sometimes a bit slow-paced, really took you on the heroine's journey with her. I read one review of this that compared this coming-of-age novel to a female &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;. Honest, and realistic, I would definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Bell Jar underscores the fact that some of us, regardless of intellectual, financial, or social status, simply cannot find our own link to life. This inner inability to connect with the world manifests itself as disenchantment. It may ultimately result in depression, addiction and untimely death, self-induced or otherwise. Although categorized as fiction, this book provides excellent insight into a recurring problem in our society."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This book is a wonderful book about understanding the way people really feel. It is very realistic and makes you open your eyes to the idea that in the past, people were mistreated in the psychological institutions and were thought of as being insane, instead of people who could be helped with proper treatment. It is very sad, but worth reading."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"It is a tragedy that a writer with this brilliant of a voice died by the very hands that transferred her story to paper.The Bell Jar is a haunting novel of a girl in her prime trapped in her downward spiral. Plath writes eloquently, so that what Esther feels, the reader feels. No stone is left unturned in the insanity that follows.I don't know a woman personally, who has not weeped somewhere throughtout this book. A must read for any Plath lover."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I love The Bell Jar..I thought it was such a good book.

This is the reason I give The Bell Jar only a 4 star rating. While reading this book, one questions whether or not Esther is truly insane. I began to rationalize her thoughts and was pulled into her world. Are you living in a bell jar?"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I expected The Bell Jar to be much more depressing than it turned out to be. Esther has won a short story contest the prize for which is a month in New York as a guest editor on a popular ladies' magazine. While in New York, Esther begins to feel the lethargy of depression creep in and feels that she is squandering her wonderful opportunity by just wanting to escape. When Esther returns home, she falls deeper into depression until a suicide attempt lands her in a hospital.Ester is also quite a burgeoning feminist. She bemoans the possibility of ending up tethered to a man and having her personality subsumed by him. Page 69: \\"And I knew that in spite of all the roses and kisses and restaurant dinners a man showered on a woman before he married her, what he secretly wanted when the wedding service ended was for her to flatten out underneath his feet like Mrs. Willard's kitchen mat.\\"I would have appreciated a deeper understanding of the root causes of Esther's depression. It seems she skims over the surface of her experiences, telling about events and feelings, without ever illuminating us as to the underlying issues. According to the end notes, Plath's mother wanted to prevent the book's publication in the states. Apparently some of the characterizations were quite thinly veiled, and Mrs. Plath was concerned that people would take offense. This might explain why Sylvia chose not to go deeper.Also according to the end notes, at the time of her suicide, Plath was working on a second novel based on her experiences since being discharged from the hospital. I would very much like to have been able to read this book. According to Wikipedia, though Plath's husband, Ted Hughes has some manuscripts and journals that were not to be published until 2013. Hopefully, these works will then be published."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Very enjoyable read. I could picture one of my aunts being in college with the main character in the book. Very accurate description of the way I remember things from the time."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"** spoiler alert ** The first time I read this book, I got to the suicide scene really late at night and it freaked me out so much I vowed never to read it again. But then I had two professors assigned as required reading in college English classes and after a second and third reading, I came to really like the book. Esther is an interesting character and I like how Plath uses language -- this novel and her poetry both have an unconventional beauty about them."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The reason i read this book is because i had to pick a bk for a book report for a psych class and i read really good reviews about it so i thought why not. It did seem to take a little time to pick up pace but was still very good and interesting. I loved how the author was able to tell the story, she truely did a good job of that. What this bk definitely does an awesome job of is letting people see through the eyes of someone facing major depression. It blew me away and can't ever imagine having to deal with it."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Esther, a young woman living in the 1950s, should be on top of the world. She is recognized as brilliant by her peers and by the committees who keep awarding her scholarships and academic prizes. She has won the opportunity to spend the summer in New York city, living a glamorous life as a magazine junior editor.All of the opportunities of the world are open to Esther.... and this fact absolutely paralyzes her. She is terrified of making the wrong decision, of losing out on something by choosing something else. She begins to feel that doing anything at all is futile and nothing in her life matters anyway.When Esther is passed over for an elite summer writing course, her world begins to crumble. She feels as though her life is slipping from her control, and she spends a great deal of time thinking about the various ways she could commit suicide. It seems that drastic measures are required to calm Esther's troubled mind, and she finds them in an asylum for women.I found the workings of Esther's mind to be fascinating. In so many respects she seems like any young woman trying to find her place in the world and decide which path she will take and, by definition, which paths will be left behind. The mental anguish she faces at participating in day-to-day life, though, is clear and beautifully written. Esther is smart and amusing and terribly troubled, and it was devastating to read about her decline and her difficulties with simply living her life."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I read several reviews about this book and I wasn't sure if I should have purchased it. It's amazing! I enjoyed reading The Bell Jar. It was not depressing as other reviews suggested. Read it-you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The Bell Jar is an extraordinary piece of literature that delves into the very substance of Plath's mind, and her frustration with the outside world and the people within it. Plath's descriptions and metaphors of her surroundings give insight into her coming-of-age phase and her fall into a deep, dark state. Wonderfully written and an intriguing interpretation of what some of us regard as this dismal world, you'll come back to read it over and over."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The book was shipped quickly and was received in the condition that it had stated when purchased."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"In college I took a literature course in American literature and my teacher chose the theme of \\"madness\\" for the course. The syllabus called for a few of Ralph Ellison's works, Toni Morrison's, and Sylvia Plath's. Sadly, since the course was only ten weeks, Sylvia Plath's \\"The Bell Jar\\" was not discussed in the class. I didn't bother to read the book until out of college.After reading reviews online, I decided that I needed to take the time to read it. Plath starts the story off really slow with Esther Greenwood explaining her internship over the summer. For the first fifty pages I had no idea why it was deemed a classic. However, though slow, I still had a desire to read what happened to Ms. Greenwood. The more that I read of the book, the harder is was to put down. If she would have shown the same symptoms today, I do not believe that she would have been locked up in an asylum. The book really makes society take a deep stare into itself to observe what is happening to the people of the nation.Being an English literature major in college, I had the opportunity to read countless classics and consider myself to be well read. I can honestly say that \\"The Bell Jar\\" is the only book that is considered a 'classic' that has ever made me cry uncontrollably one minute (when reading about the electro shock treatments) and then a few moments later be laughing hyterically (when Esther gives the nurse a piece of her mind when he serves her two different kinds of beans in one meal).This book is a must read for the female population, and I recommend everyone reading it. I don't really know why but I had a tendency to compare Esther to Holden Caulfield because of her self destruction and her \\"could care less about what is right\\" attitude. It's such a shame that Plath took her life so early when she clearly had an incredible gift of writing."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This is my favorite book of all time.

Sylvia's struggle to write a novel, seem not to exist as we read this autobiographical book of her struggles and her descent into madness. As you read you feel Esther and her awkwardness and you do really get touched by her and survive even if Sylvia didn't. This book also deals with frustration, men, writing, sadness, and depressing luck even though it seemed to be good. All I have to say is this is a must read!"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I have read this book and it was really amazing - I felt I was going mad together with the girl and then I recovered with her.

The main themes of this book were depression and problem relationships. A big part dealing with sex and her relationships with guys that never seem to work out.

The writing is unique and every chapter flows right in the next. I did not want to put the book down."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The Bell Jar tells the story of Esther Greenwood's slow descent into madness. Really a thinly veiled recounting of Plath's own mental troubles and her first suicide attempt, it provides a disturbingly realistic account of how a smart, talented and promising young woman can fall so far.Esther Greenwood is a scholarship student at a prestigious Eastern women's college and a talented writer. However, when she fails to gain admission to a summer writing course, her first inklings of psychological trouble multiply and she falls quickly into despair.The book takes the readers into Greenwood's mind. The slight changes in perceptions, the means of reacting to life's events, the thought processes, change gradually for the reader, as they did for Esther herself. Only the reader is better equipped to track the changes and to predict the result.The book describes Greenwood's suicide attempt and eventual recovery. It likens depression to being inside of a bell jar, which distorts the senses for the person trapped inside of it. At the same time, it recounts her journey into adulthood, her exploration of her body and sexuality, which remains active even at her lowest points, and definition of herself as a woman.At the height of Greenwood's mania, the repeated thoughts of suicide become tiresome. However, Plath presents both the lead-up to her psychosis and her recovery in a realistic and moving manner. The biographical note at the end of the book presents a helpful summary of Plath's life.Plath's eventual death by suicide at the age of 30 make this work all the more moving. Despite her struggle to get out from under the bell jar, she couldn't prevent its final descent. Readers can only sympathize by viewing, through this book, what it was like for her inside the jar."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I've recently decided to write a review for every book I ever loved. So, yes this is written in retrospect. And perhaps I don't have all the detail written down perfectly. But if you want to read a summary, I'm afraid to inform you that I cannot give you one. I can only give you my opinion.I was quite young when I first read this; maybe 14 or 15. Perhaps I was too young to fully understand it. I was, for one, a neurotic over achiever and couldn't quite grasp that someone could have an inability not to work. But looking back, I now find myself in the same situation or rather coming out of the same situation.I recommend this book to everyone, but only after you break into a few of life's tragedies and turmoil. Otherwise, there will be a void in reading this that can't be comprehended or severely hinders the reading.This was certainly written by a poet. It flows smoothly and nothing too contrive or sentences that were complicatedly constructed for the sake of being complicated. I remember fully enjoying this book.This book is as relevant today as it is was in the 60s when it was written. Things have changed, yes. But things have also remained the same. The same stresses, worries and concerns still plague many up and coming adolescents. (It's funny for me to write that sentence as one.)What I love most about this book is that it is not a moral tale warning about the rights and wrongs of life. Neither is an apologetic story. She doesn't make excuses. She tells it like it was for her. Being lost, being annoyed at being asked \\"what are you going to do with the rest of your life\\", being the odd one out, being gawky. All of this is still relevant today as it is for me.Where it loses people is when she starts to spiral down. It's a natural progression that flows smoothly downward---there was never one big incident or anything that explain any such thing. It doesn't try to prod in the physiological of the matter. It's like a first hand account of an accident about to occur where the person can't explain what is about to happen. She just knows she is going to crash.I'm not saying you have to be depressed or a wounded human being to read this. No. No one is perfect; everyone has problems. If you're young, maybe give this books a few years. But if you've lived some, then read this. This is not a story to be missed. Easy. Deep. Mesmerizing."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Victoria Lucas wrote this fictional novel, but it is based on Sylvia Plath's real life. Which makes sense, considering Victoria Lucas is only a pseudonym for Plath. This is the closest anyone will ever get of an actual Plath autobiography, which is sad, because The Bell Jar ends leaving many questions unanswered.Plath's own scholarship was at Mademoiselle Magazine, where she was a guest editor for a month. Esther's patron, Philomena Guinea, is based on Plath's own patron, Olive Higgins Prouty, best known for writing Stella Dallas and Now, Voyager. The individual who was the character base for Joan later sued after the book was published under Plath's real name following her suicide. The court ruled in her favor that she was unfairly branded as gay in the novel. Esther's suicide attempt is a mirror image of one of Plath's own. Both the main character and the author under went electroshock therapy, which also links the protagonist with the Rosenbergs, who Ester refers to in the opening, reflecting on their execution in the electric chair. Coincidently, Plath left two children behind after her suicide, as did the Rosenbergs.Its disturbing to read the Bell Jar, knowing how true to life it is and what happens to Esther in real life. Plath continues to be an enigma and the Bell Jar does not offer any insight into who she really was. It is difficult to connect to Esther Greenwood. She follows through life, disconnected, winning awards for her writing and flying through college on scholarship. Eventually, she wins a chance to spend a summer working at a New York magazine. Her first friend is Doreen, a \\"dirty common slag\\" that Esther would rather not associate with but wants to emulate. Losing her virginity to punish her boyfriend Buddy Willard for losing his becomes an obsession for her. Not that she really loves or even wants Buddy to be her boyfriend. Unfortunately, she feels that she is unable to leave him once he is diagnosed with tuberculosis and sent to a sanatorium.The novel is going along well until Esther is sent home. Up until this point, the character is realistic and sympatic. However, once she moves back home, her motives become unclear. Mental illness, depression included, is always unclear, but it is difficult to understand Esther. Before, the reader felt as if they were experiencing all this with her, as if they were there. Afterwards, we are just watching her go through things, not really getting a chance to feel what she feels. Esther, upon returning home, suffers insomnia and sees a psychiatrist who gives her electroshock therapy. Esther makes several suicide attempts, the final being when she crawls into a cellar and swallows 50 sleeping pills. She is sent to a mental hospital, where is meets and makes new friends, including Joan.The Bell Jar reads as two books. The first book is a character study of a young girl in New York. I enjoyed this half. The second half is a confusing mess. However, it is not bad. As two separate books, both would stand on their own and would be very good. However, the tie between is leak and together, two excellent books become a merely good one. Three stars for the book itself, the extra star for the impact it had on society."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The Bell Jar is, what is consider, one of Sylvia Plath's greatest works. Plath wrote this novel as a biographical fiction. Sylvia Plath took the main events during a certain part of her life and changed the names and characters. This novel eloquently describes Plath's downward spiral to depression in, what some criticas call, a Salinger mood. The themes in this novel vary from Esther Greenwood, the main character, dealing with the loss of her virginity to her hatred of the domestic role that women of her time were forced to play. I really enjoyed this book because it was real. It is interesting to know that the insane events that occur in the novel actually happened to the author. I would recommend this book to anyone that has an open mind to read about suicide, sex, and electroshock therepy. Read and enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"THE BELL JAR is a book I wouldn't normally have picked up had I not read the narrative history of McLean Hospital, the asylum for those of Boston's upper crust gone balmy, GRACEFULLY INSANE by Alex Beam.Sylvia Plath's novel, an autobiographical account of her descent into madness with names changed to protect the innocent, begins in the same tone - though not with the same charm - as Susan Allen Toth's IVY DAYS, the latter's memoirs of her college days at Smith College during the last half of the 1950s . (Interestingly, it was Smith that Plath attended a couple of years previous.) Specifically, Sylvia's alter ego, Esther Greenwood, is one of twelve college girls who've won a fashion magazine contest, the prize being a month-long, expense-paid, freebie-filled, glamorous job in New York City as the guest editor of a national magazine. When the month is up, Esther returns home where, under pressure to make something of her life during her senior year of college, she cracks. From that point on, the storyline progresses from half-hearted attempts at suicide to one that almost succeeds, then subsequent admission into a country-club asylum for psychotherapy and electroshock treatment. (Though THE BELL JAR never states, even in the chapter &quot;Sylvia Plath: A Biographical Note&quot;, the author's real life experience was at McLean Hospital.) It's while on her way to the private mental institution that Esther defines &quot;bell jar&quot;:&quot;I would be sitting under the ... glass bell jar, stewing in my own sour air.&quot;THE BELL JAR is a hypnotic look at the mental deterioration of a talented and intelligent young woman. It's like watching the slow-mo replay of a person's self-destructive plunge off a building's ledge. There's perhaps an argument here for the book being required reading by the parents of any teenage girl.The literary world benefited when Sylvia Plath regained relative mental equilibrium long enough to write THE BELL JAR before succumbing to inner demons and committing suicide in 1963. Her ultimate fate renders even more poignant and prophetic her words:&quot;How did I know that someday - at college, in Europe, somewhere, anywhere - the bell jar, with its stifling distortions, wouldn't descend again?&quot;"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"One of the reviewers here stated &quot;Plath should have spent a little more time working out the ending.&quot; The ending of the book was, of course, dictated by her own circumstances.

Esther is a brilliant, prideful woman in a world where women aren't supposed to be either and are instead supposed to be like a minor character in the book whom Esther despises--a typical suburban cow, whining kids in tow. At the end of The Bell Jar, I believe we are supposed to ask the question, is Esther crazy or is her madness an appropriate reaction to the world in which she lives? The answer I believe is the latter. This book is a must read for every sensitive individual, male or female, who doesn't (or doesn't want to) think of the typical hysterical, shrieky, irritating stereotype when he or she hears the phrase \\"women and depression\\"."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"sylvia plath really knew how to put together words to make amazing collections. this was her only novel, and it is semi-autobiographical. seeing as she suffered depression, and ended her own life, this is not a happy-go-lucky novel. but it is real life at her time, and one can really relate to all the emotions felt by the character. it is very well written, just like her poems."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I'm not one to read poems, and so, I guess because of that reason I stayed away from anything to do with Sylvia Plath. Until finally I grew tired of colleagues of mine talking about this book, and decided to experience it for myself.I'm still not sure to describe how I feel about the book. It was easy reading, but at times I did grow bored, particularly the pages that are dedicated to how Esther tries to commit suicide. And yet it would have been too important to leave out.Overall, the story of Esther saddened me, knowing that Ms. Plath was basically writing about her own life. I wonder if she had been born much later (when depression wasn't considered taboo), and she would have gotten the proper treatment for her depression, what could have been. Sadly, we'll never know. I didn't realize how much of a stigma was attached to depression or &quot;crazy people&quot; back then. In that way, the book touched me.In a way, the ending wasn't very satisfying, but maybe that's the point. Nothing everything is as clear-cut as we expect it to be."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This is an amazing book.

This ironic to the prevailing suicidal theme in the novel. The thoughts are by someone who is coming of age. This book is a must read. It is not only about a woman nor a suicidal person. It is about an fallible human and her raw inner thoughts about happenings around her. The genius is in Sylvia's objectiveness and her sharp unwitting intelligent remarks!"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"\\"The Bell Jar.\\" What is a bell jar anyway? This is what I asked myself when I picked the book off the shelf. The dictionary's definition of a bell jar is a bell shaped container or cover made of glass used to keep gases, air, or moisture out. This relates to the book because Esther feels as though her insanity or mental instability is causing her to be shut out from the rest of the world much like the bell jar shuts out the air. Esther feels almost suffocated by her own insecurities and on her road to psychological recovery she says that the closer she becomes to being cured, the more the bell jar is lifted and she can finally breathe.The book is an autobiography on the troubled author Sylvia Plath. In the book you can definitely see the parallels between Sylvia and the main character, Esther.The book opens with Esther sympathizing with the Rosenbergs who had just been executed for espionage. Esther says she wonders how it would feel to have her nerves fried like the Rosenbergs had. This offers the reader an example of foreshadowing. Although Esther has not said anything about suicide yet, this does show that there is some what of an interest on this topic that has not yet surfaced.Esther is very bright and is in New York working at a New York magazine. She is there on a scholarship she had won. She temporarily lives in a an all girls hotel. She has two close friends in New York, the first being a southern belle named Doreen. Doreen was very audacious and a definite rule breaker. Esther felt as though she shouldn't be hanging out with Doreen because of her bad habits but being with Doreen always provides a fun and adventurous time. The other of Esther' s friends is a slender blonde named Betsy. Betsy was very proper and sophisticated. She was the opposite of what Doreen was.Another person in this novel which really plays a large role in Esther' s life is her \\"acquaintance\\" Buddy Willard. Buddy has Tuberculosis and lives in a TB sanitarium, Although we are introduced to Buddy as just an acquaintance we later find out Buddy actually had a relationship with Esther. Esther then learns of an affair Buddy had over the summer. In an attempt to even the score with Buddy she tries to sleep with a man, (Constantin) she had met. This plan falls through and they just fall asleep. Buddy then invites Esther to the Yale Junior Prom. Buddy also \\"reveals\\" himself to Esther and she asks him if he really did have an affair and it proves to be true. This shatters Esther's dream of the two being together. Although he later asks her to marry him Esther declines.Esther then starts to feel a little depressed and this is when Doreen sets Esther up with a Peruvian woman-hater named Marco. This is the man that in my opinion will change Esther' s life forever. At first he dazzles her with a diamond but he later expects something in return and he tries to rape her. Esther then goes back to the hotel and in a rage throws all her clothes off the roof. I took this incident as a metaphor for her throwing her life in New York away and sadly returning to her grief stricken life at home in Wellesly. She leaves New York that night to head home. Upon her return home she learns that the summer course she had hoped to take at Harvard did not accept her. This will start her first and worst summer at home. The tuning point in the story is when on top of her failure to be accepted to the Harvard course, she learns that Buddy is falling in love with a nurse at the TB clinic. This presses the bell jar's edges tightly against the ground. Knowing this crushing news she goes to the pharmacist and has her sleeping pill prescription increased.Esther is sent to Doctor Gordon a psychiatrist who suggests electro shock therapy. After experiencing the treatment she wanted to commit suicide. She wasn't able to slit her wrists so she takes a multitude of sleeping pills and locked herself in the basement.Her attempts didn't work and she awoke in darkness. She couldn't see and was told she would eventually meet a nice blind man. Esther breaks a thermometer and a ball of mercury lays on the floor in a few smaller balls and she pushes them together, and they fuse back into one. I think this represents her breakdown, only I don't think her emotions can be put together as easily as the mercury was.She is then moved to a private hospital where she gets a female doctor. Esther gets injections three times a day to begin her treatment. From Caplan she is moved to Belsize which is a step closer to recovery. Dr. Nolan, (her new psychiatrist) resumes the shock therapy and Esther recovers more rapidly. Esther begins to gain more privileges and her recovery was almost complete. Esther then loses her virginity to a man whom she had met on the steps of a Harvard library named Irwin. She was dropped off at her friend Joan's house after hemorrhaging from intercourse. Joan re-enrolled in Belize, (being a former patient.) One day Joan wasn't home by curfew and Esther was asked if she knew of her where abouts. Esther didn't know and later Joan was found in the woods.....dead. After being convinced Joan's suicide was not Esther' s fault, she is interviewed to be released back to school. Thus showing that Esther was finally cured.The feeling that I got from this book is overall depression. The book is sad because Esther's life is full of many hardships and many things to over come."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I found Sylvia Plath\`s novel, &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; to be a genuinely moving and brutally honest read. Plath\`s untouchable use of words are so keen and vivid, reading her book is almost like watching a film. &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; is about a young and talented woman named Esther Greenwood. After a won trip to New York City, Esther slowly recognizes her new found feelings of despair, and starts to feel herself and her life sinking deeper and deeper into a profound depression. The book\`s journey from sanity to madness is captivating and almost harrowing, as we witness the hell the protagonist must endure. The most incredible thing about &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; is how is remains so subtle and natural, but still manifests terror to it\`s highest degree. Sylvia Plath\`s heart is written on every page, and reading &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; will give you a good relfection of her bitter but realistic view on herself, humanity, America and life. A definite must-read."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Forgive me, but I just can't understand the popularity of this book. It's supposed to get us inside the mind of a mentally ill young woman, but to me it's merely a two-dimensional relating of events without any true depictions of the raging emotions that must have been going on inside the heroine's mind during them.I came across Plath's \\"The Bell Jar\\" in a roundabout way. After seeing the rental video version of Elizabeth Wurtzel's \\"Prozac Nation\\", I read the book. Being prone to depression myself, I felt quite a bit of empathy for Wurtzel's stream-of-consciousness relating of her experiences when she was suffering from acute depression and the way her mind was racing at the time. Yet, when I read other readers' reviews of Wurtzel's book, I was shocked at how many readers felt it was unconvincing and recommended Plath's \\"The Bell Jar\\" or Susanna Kaysen's \\"Girl, Interrupted\\" instead. So, I read those books, too.Plath's \\"novel\\" is actually a novella-length, autobiographical sketch of Plath's own experiences with depression/schizophrenia as is made clear by both the Introduction and the Biographical Note included. The plot itself is interesting enough (hence, two stars), but that's ALL Plath gives us. A book like this needs to make us FEEL what Plath is feeling. And this Plath doesn't do at allExample: Plath blandly states that she hasn't been able to sleep at all for three weeks. And just leaves it at that. Maybe she assumes everyone's had the same experience. But I've BEEN there. Chronic insomnia cripples and isolates you. If she hadn't slept in three weeks, she would hardly be able to communicate with anyone around her. And believe me, most \\"normal\\" people do NOT know what that is like at all.Another example: Plath suffers from schizophrenia. Fortunately, I don't; but many years ago I read Joanne Greenberg's \\"I Never Promised You a Rose Garden\\" -- another autobiographical novel by a schizophrenic and, interestingly, written at about the same time Plath was writing this book (the 1960s). Greenberg's depictions of her \\"voices\\" holding counsel inside her mind haunt me to this day. At one point Plath mentions that her own \\"voices\\" were screaming at her, too. And again just leaves it at that. What did her voices say to her? How did they say it? How did they affect her? You won't find out by reading this book.At any rate, for those who are trying to experience what it's really like to look out at the world from a mind suffering from some sort of chronic depression, I still highly recommend Wurtzel's \\"Prozac Nation\\". For those interested in what it's like to be institutionalized, I recommend Kaysen's \\"Girl Interrupted\\", but not as highly. For those wanting to experience the world of schizophrenia, I strongly recommend Greenberg's \\"I Never Promised You a Rose Garden\\", even though this book is hardly mentioned in other readers' reviews.As for Plath's \\"The Bell Jar\\" . . . alas, I can't recommend it for anyone."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This book really takes you along with this tortured soul's journey into madness. I was amazed at how my own mind fell into the same confused patterns of the main character. A testement to the outstanding writing skill of the author. I think the experience is enhanced by researching and understanding a little about Plath before reading the book."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I found Sylvia Plath\`s autobiographical novel, &quot;The Bell Jar&quot;, a brilliant book, one that would define classic literature. It was honest, absorbing, poignant, intense and haunting all at the same time. Syliva Plath\`s ability of making a story into such an afflicting, bitter and tragic experience is striking. What amazed me the most was how the novel followed a woman\`s life through sanity into madness so delicately and naturally, you could barely tell when andwhere the &quot;bell jar&quot; started to close in on the main character. &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; is signifigant book because it\`s richly described story and dialogue will forever remain untouchable."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I first encountered Sylvia Plath fresh out of my tumultuous high school years, during which I dropped out and went back. I've suffered from bouts of depression since the beginning of adolescence. Throughout adolescence, these manifested themselves in myriad ways, from the typical rebelliousness to a two-month period around the age of seventeen wherein I couldn't even manage a smile and cried seemingly for hours nearly every day.At around age twenty I began to take my writing seriously (so dangerous and giddy a moment for any writer!). I discovered her poetry, and this wrenching and bitter and beautiful novel, at a point in which I began to have more frequent episodes, as well as a time in which I fell in love, did my Kerouac thing, started college. Here was a writer who not only went ahead into these horrors herself, but had the unwavering courage to document them and share them with others.As a literary work, the novel seethes with immortality, making a perpetual watermark in fire on the mind with its images: Esther trailing her finger along the wall of the building to help her keep her balance and bearing, the ends of the hair in the vomit like tree roots in a bog, Esther peering at Buddy from behind her hair (a mask utilized to illustrate the double standard and hypocrisies of both sets of behavior), Constantin's apartment, the lunch on the cold day when Esther and Mr. Willard drive up to the Adirondacks to see Buddy.As a work of psychological prowess and permanence, I don't know that I've ever read anything that more skillfully paints a portrait of such a descent. As a work of catharsis, I think, it is without parallel in this century. Sylvia Plath has become a kindred spirit to many writers out there, and many, as well, who suffer similar perils. This novel has marked the beginning, the first terrifying steps into the emotional devastation possible in the hands of contemporary culture. There is no other work yet like it, and there may never be."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The Bell Jar shows brilliance and misery that is meant to be savoired and loved by the millions of miserable fans wanting a good read. Besides writing the most beautiful metaphors and similes, Syliva Plath has a genuine misery that mists her words that makes you fill a vacant spot in your soul for her. You become the character Esther Greenwood, you feel her insecurities, her anger, and her despair. She drags you under the bell jar she is trapped under, to where you can feel only the stale breath from your lungs and nothing fresh or good. It is an absolute must read, along with her poetry!"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"When I finished this novel for the first time, I took a deep breath, tried to collect myself, and began to read it agian. Plath tells her story (and it is her own story) manner-of-factly, but she never loses the reader in a sea of detachment. The novel is stirring and disturbing; it would be impossible to read it and to feel nothing. It is an excellent choice for anyone and would be especially moving for a young woman who is caught in the struggle of trying to find out who she is."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"After reading this book you start wondering why did it get your attention like that. You feel you're in the very same skin of Esther Greenwood, going through the Asylum paths, seeing all your friends drown in the distance. It'll definitely influence you in some way, it might be a good way as well as it might be a bad way, whatever your mind tells you.

Bell Jar explores the human mind through Esther Greenwood (who is Plath herself, indeed) and the society around her. Bordering on a delicate balance between sanity and insanity, Bell Jar is probing, questioning, dark and at times scary. But so very real at all times. Plath pours out a lifetime through Esther in Bell Jar. It's a pity there aren't too many novels like Bell Jar, but then it's a greater pity there was only one Sylvia Plath."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Although this book was harsh reading, it was a slap in the face of reality. It was real, and it was depressing, but it gives society something to understand. We are all not perfect people and not everyone is going to go to college. It just shows us that there are so many pressures out there that it is hard for a young man or woman to survive. I thought it was very depressing, but very poetic at the same time. It really just makes you think."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I've always been a fan of the work of Sylvia Plath. We share a birthday and my best friend had a few of her books so I decided on buying this book simply because I was bored. I'm 15 currently and I really felt a connection with this book as she branches out into insanity. This makes Go Ask Alice pale is comparison. Anyone looking for an interesting read really should buy The Bell Jar."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I read this book because I wanted to see what the big deal was. Apparently the author took her own life a month after the book first appeared in 1963 under her pseudonym \\"Victoria Lucas.\\" Critics say the character Esther Greenwood is an extension of the author. Perhaps it also refers to the book of Esther. I don't know. Nevetheless, it is a typical 1960's book. The protagonist is well compared with Holden Caulfield of \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" (another overrated book). Holden and Esther both are in New York City, the former in the 40's, the latter in the 50's. Like Holden, Esther gradually loses her marbles. In fact, the first part of the book differs radically from the second half of the book. The first part is the narrator during sanity, the latter part is the narrator during insanity, so to speak. Although Esther loses it more than Holden, Holden narrates his story from the nut house. She is the classic mixed up person of Hedda Gabler of Ibsen lore. Esther too, like Hedda Gabler, attempts suicide. What is tragic is not the descent into mental anarchy of Esther, but the fact her problems in the novel were essentially problems because she was too immature to deal with them. This is evident by Esther's inability to make choices. All choices have unforeseen consequences. No one is omnniscient. The solution to her problems was she needed to simply \\"grow up.\\" It's like falling into suicidal despair because your favorite soap opera was canceled. Some critics have suggested that Esther's problems have to do with repression. In part, I agree. But the definition of that repression has been skewed. The objectification of women is not liberation unless you bought into the twisted logic of the political left. Unless women are liberated to clean house, cook meals, send the kids off to school, clean laundry and go to the grocery store, this repression will only continue. Similarly, white men need to be liberated from the defamation perpetrated against them by the so-called House of David laying at the white man's feet the alleged repression of women and minorities. It is noteworthy that the number of suicides amongst women increased dramatically when women were shamed away from their natural vocation as wife and mother. Unless women are allowed to be women and not pinups for greedy men like Hugh Hefner, Al Goldstein and other members of the synagogue, to be objectified and marketed like slabs of meat, they will remain in bondage to unnatural repression."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I am almost sorry to say that my reading of Sylvia Plath's novel \\"The Bell Jar\\" was not nearly as moving or thought-provoking as it seems to be for so many. In my opinion, \\"The Bell Jar\\"'s Esther Greenwood is entirely unsympathetic, to the detriment of the novel. While I recognize the necessity of emphasizing her deterioration, I found her to be overly melodramatic and weak (while still recognizing her \\"condition\\"), and I loathed her from the start. While I will allow that Plath's prose is more eloquent than her poetry I failed to find evidence of the brilliance so often extolled."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I ordered this book for my english 101 class in college, we just started getting into the later chapters of The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath.

I'm missing a good 3 chapters of the book! I'm very unhappy as I expected to have the full, undamaged version of the book.

When did she undergo the electroshock therapy--on page 1 or page 101? We can't tell because Esther's a bore right from the start and there's no difference in her character between &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after.&quot; Plath does an unenviable job of turning her tumultuous life into a tedious collection of journal entries of a lifeless, forgettable character.

I would probably be more interested in reading a book about her written by someone else."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"First off, why exactly did Esther Greenwood have this breakdown? I looked for clues in how she talked and what she talked about, but could only assume various items. In a work of literature, I don't care who you are, it is important to answer all the readers' questions. Why did she have the breakdown? What was the underlying motive for attempting suicide? How did it affect the rest of her life after all was said and done? I did not get the answers to these questions after finishing the book. This made it hard for me to care for Esther as much as Plath probably wanted each reader to. I just didn't understand where Esther was coming from when she ranted on and on about how fabulous it would be to die. I couldn't feel her pain because I didn't know where it came from. Same goes for Joan. There wasn't enough of her character to really get into to feel shocked and upset at the announcement of her death. Secondly, there were quiet a bit of failed metaphors in the story. Plath used the death metaphor too much and in the wrong places at times. Finally, I didn't get a final resolution out of this story. Esther mentioned near the end &quot;How do I know the bell jar won't descend again?&quot; That deprives the story of any climatic ending right there. I mean, so what if she's let out of Belsize, if the bell jar descends again, then why does this entire ordeal that Plath told matter?"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"For most of my adult life (I am 49) people who get to know me tell me that I would absolutely love this book.

Where can you see the fictional elements creeping in? How has she altered her history to create a compelling story?"},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"\\"The Bell Jar\\" is one of the most pathetic, self-absorbent pieces of writing ever published. Esther tried to literally and figuratively dig her own grave and is to be pitied. If the writer dared to look beyond Esther, reading it might have been pleasurable and insightful. As it stands, Esther's character was written as to be so self-absorbed that she is barely aware of the world around her, and even when she dares to open her eyes, she sees nothing but the world against her.Undoubtedly, at the time the novel was written, the world was very different then for women. But what I fail to see is any strength in Esther. Other than cower in a corner and cry, she appeared to want the world to cater to her. I'm sure this had a lot to do with her mental illness, but the book boils down to a pitiful tail of a girl who stood by and let the world swallow her up. I think this might make good reading for psychiatrists to peer into the world of insanity, but for the rest of us, it seems little more than a whiny tale of self-indulgence. The writing style of the book was quite good. The content was quite poor."},{"Title":"The Bell Jar (Great Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I found the whole thing to be painfully contrived. Her word use, while precise, is TOO precise, in the sense that I get the distinct feeling she agonized over each one to make the character sound as depressed as possible. What's odd about it is that there doesn't seem to be any real reason for any of it, nor is any particular behavior described that might give me a hint at what goes on in anyone else's mind while interacting with her [Esther Greenwood]. All sincerity seems to have been leeched out of the book which is then peppered with ridiculous assertions that make self-proclaimed feminists sigh with pleasure. Since this is evidently semi-autobiographical I can't imagine what to make of that.Nearly every transition is abrupt and awkward and most of the characters have been flattened out and made into caricatures of feminist archetypes in the most tortured, juvenile manner imaginable. Needless to say that the plot, such as it is, is not helped in the least by any of the \\"people\\" that inhabit it. I could say so much more, but rest assured that it is all scathing.Luckily, it's the only novel she ever wrote, thus sparing me from the agony of someone convincing me to give her another chance. I spent $17 on this book. I consider this another stroke of luck as it is the only feminist work I imagine I'll ever buy, and consider my education complete and cheap at the price!"},{"Title":"RIVER THROUGH TIME","review":"\\"A River Through Time\\" was the perfect read for our vacation in Oahu.

For those who have \\"fallen\\" into their spiritual awakening, this book can provide some explanations. For those who are afraid to take on their own ability as healers, this is a story of courage and a demonstration of results.This may not be the best read for those who don't believe in past lives or communicating through dreams...and yet again, why not?A great read when you want to escape to the islands--or need inspiration to keep putting one foot in front of the other."},{"Title":"RIVER THROUGH TIME","review":"BB Hill's compelling first novel takes you into the sterile efficiency of open heart surgery, the drama of contemporary Hawaii and its politics, as well as the mystical paradise of ancient Hawaii. It is a great read dedicated to the science and the art of healing as well as the wisdom of ancient tribes and the power of community. This engaging novel will open hearts and minds.The main character is a scrappy and courageous OR nurse manager who feels that her ability to see into ancient Hawaii is often more of a burden than a gift. I found myself drawn also to the wise Hawaiian Kahuna (sage and seer), an ancient Hawaiian healer and his wife, the leader of a tribe, as well as to a strong and sweet guitar player/single dad. Hill knows her way around traditional and alternative healing, group dynamics, earth based spirituality, not to mention scuba diving. She weaves the ancient and the present gracefully into a great story and evokes images as strongly as she develops characters.If you love Hawaii, have ever wished there were better ways for people to make decisions in corporate America, respect the work done by healers and healthcare workers everywhere, or have fallen in love; you will enjoy A River Through Time. I recommend it without hesitation."},{"Title":"RIVER THROUGH TIME","review":"I absolutely loved this book! BB Hill has a gift for story-telling and bringing characters to life. River through time is a very compelling story--actually two stories beautifully interwoven. The main story is about the clash in Hawaiian health care between complementary treatments and corporate medicine. The underlying story brings Hawaiian history and culture to the present, so that we are all present, even those who have passed on, all connected by a River though Time. The book incorporates energy healing into the sterility of modern medicine: breathing and light and spiritual rituals that accomplished what surgery and pharmaceuticals cannot. We need to learn from the healers of the past, and return to the authenticity of medicine before it was taken over by corporate America. This book helps to put modern medicine into perspective."},{"Title":"RIVER THROUGH TIME","review":"Fortunately, I took this book on vacation with me because, once begun, I had to read it straight through.

She captures the heart and sole of the real Hawaii, too, avoiding the superficial Hawaii known to the multitudes of tourists. If you love Hawaii, the Hawaiian people, and a great read, then this book is a must. It will have you running the gamut of emotions along with the true to life characters of this story."},{"Title":"RIVER THROUGH TIME","review":"What a wonderful novel...I would highly recommend this book.

In reading this book, one is tempted to try to memorize some of the quotations which have particular relevance to the reader's interests.

What I have noticed is that it is quality not quantity that matters. If you are like me, you would probably prefer to read ten brilliant quotes over five pages than five brilliant quotes over ten pages. You may notice that not all quotation books are created equal, even though they may contrive to be equal or superior in appearance.For example, the Forbes book of business contains over 10,000 quotes, and only a few pages in the entire book are dedicated to business quotations. Many quotations are by philosphers and poets, but would you hire a philosopher to run your business?In addition, there is very little screening for the power or effect of a quote, so the book is not what it pretends to be, and it does not have a keyword search, which I found quite frustrating when looking for the single Rockefeller 'I believe' quote I wanted to write down.On the other hand, I am very impressed with LeBaron's book. It has close to 2,800 quotes, organised according to various investment themes, such as active portfolio management, contrarian investing, risk management, manias panics and crashes, economic forecasting, politics and investing,technical analysis, value investing to mention a few of the thirty or so themes. You can also do a keyword search, although it's not as detailed as in say the Oxford Book of Quotations. I found myself copiously copying down pages of notes of notable quotes, many from Warren Buffett.Here are a few examples:Risk comes from not knowing what you're doing.

The format of the Standard is easy to follow and understand because it is not loaded up with gobs of mumbo-jumbo jargon. I truly find that the steps laid out in the...&quot;Getting Ready&quot;...&quot;Doing&quot;....and &quot;Follow-up&quot; format is enormously helpful and would be especially helpful to someone newly exposed to the Kaizen tool.Bottom line....I wish I had this book seven years ago ! Super, Super reference for a Kaizen facilitator. The CD is an unexpected bonus. Truly a great package."},{"Title":"Kaizen Desk Reference Standard","review":"I like this book. It describes the process and has a process map for doing Kaizen. The flow of the chapters follows the flow of the process map. Each chapter gives a step-by-step guide for accomplishing one of the Kaizen milestones. It gives the details needed to see what to do and get it done RIGHT. Other books I've read just have concepts. Kaizen Desk Reference Standard shows you how to do Kaizen. Besides the the actual steps, it provides examples and contains forms and tools to tailor to your workplace for implementation. It's more helpful than most training I have been to. What I like best is that it points out the traps you could fall into and how to avoid them. It sets you up to succeed and make REAL improvements."},{"Title":"Kaizen Desk Reference Standard","review":"The authors have performed a great service to those wishing to make improvements in their workplace by eliminating waste and improving efficiency. The Kaizen Desk Reference Standard provides much needed detailed information about the process and the approach to make those necessary improvements.This reference for conducting a Kaizen event is full of very useful worksheets that structure the event. A detailed example of a simulated project is thoroughly documented providing completed worksheets demonstrating their use. Of particular interest, the text provides tips that are generously scattered throughout to help those with little experience to prepare for handling the road blocks that often occur in implementing change strategies. There are many forms that provide structure in conducting meetings, brainstorming sessions, documenting improvements, tracking changes, and taking corrective actions. As a bonus, the accompanying CD provides the templates of these forms either in PDF, M/S Word, or M/S Excel format. These useful templates are very well structured and apply to many improvement tasks attempted in the development of a high-performing organization.Many of the resource tools demonstrated in the text apply to those trying to implement LEAN in manufacturing applications for the first time and serve to help structure a strategy for doing so. The step-by-step process demonstrated in the text combines many of the organizational and team leadership strategies to identify sources of wastes, develop process flow charts, handle team dynamics, developing consensus, identifying root causes, and documenting gains. Also, the text stresses the need for standardization of processes and the commitment of management in the process of change. Standardization requires accountability and responsible leadership in which there may be reluctance to adopt.This text is a must read primer for anyone attempting to lead a Kaizen event or attempting to make changes within their workplace to foster the development of a high-performing organization. The step-by-step approach demonstrates a strategy that should yield greater success on the first attempt. Anyone involved in recommending change, should keep a copy of this text on their desk. It is easy to read, if full of examples, and is accompanied with a very useful selection of forms available to use for process improvements.I would like to extend my thanks for a job well done.James P.

If you want to have a comprehensive reference guide this is it. This format can also be used for general project management.If you are just getting started and need something a little less intense, there is a smaller book that provides an excellent roadmap for doing kaizen events - \\"A Team Leader's Guide to Lean Kaizen Events\\".disclaimer: I know Dr. Vitalo, author of \\"Kaizen Desk Reference Standard\\""},{"Title":"Mission-Critical Security Planner: When Hackers Won't Take No for an Answer","review":"It is very rarely, that you'd see a good high-level security book nowadays. There are lots of great \\"worm-eye view\\" books with nice detailed descriptions of attacks, defenses, secure configuration options, tools and tricks. However, many of the high-level books resolve to quoting some outdated CSI/FBI survey, blabbering about security policy and giving out piles of outworldly advice on how to \\"mitigate risks\\".This visionary book proves the opposite: you can have a high-level security book, which is not just practical, but actionable. \\"Mission Critical Security Planner\\" delivers a portion of the security process, packed into one toolkit. Make no mistake - this book is about planning how to do security, not how to tweak your scanner or configure a firewall. However, planning is indeed a critical (and, as the author points out, often missing) piece of security conundrum, and the book delivers on that.An awesome component of the book is a large collection of templates and worksheets on \\"selling\\" security measures, planning the implementations, organizing security team, dealing with various business people and many other occasions. The book has the printed versions while its companion website criticalsecurity.com has the download.The main part of the book is organized around \\"security fundamentals\\", large domains of security (such as authentication, encryption, integrity, privacy, etc), which are used to structure the security planning process, described by the author. For each of the fundamentals, the content is organized in sections: summary, security stack (covering various aspects from physical to application level), life-cycle management (from technology selection to response), business (on dealing with various categories of business people, such as suppliers and customers) and selling security (to execs, managers and staff). All of the above contain various templates.Among the more fun parts, the section on negotiating with hackers is just exclusive and of the never-seen-before kind. Section in hacker profiling is also of interest, since it seems to originate from author's experiences (and not in just reading about it on the news). The book also demystifies such elusive notions as \\"impact analysis\\", \\"security ROI\\". PKI also has a prominent role in the book. While PKI (as it is defined today) might or might not fly, the book gives a great example of large-scale production implementation, running for many years. Another great feature of the book is author's \\"future 10 attacks list\\" with his predictions on threat landscape.Overall, the book seems indispensable to those responsible for securing networks. Security managers and CSOs will likely gain maximum benefits from using it (due to the book targeting), but other security professionals will benefit as well. Notice, that the benefits can be derived from \\"using\\" it as opposed to just \\"reading\\" it, although even the latter will prove highly enlightening. The \\"selling security\\" templates alone are likely worth their weigh in gold. The book is well-written and, while not possessing the lively style of some recent security books, will beat some of them hands down in real-world applicability. After all, even if you very well know that IDS is valuable, who will help you to \\"sell\\" it to the CIO? This book just might!Anton Chuvakin, Ph.D., GCIA, GCIH is a Senior Security Analyst with a major information security company.

With this book, half the battle is won because you at least know how to do the planning. You still have to do the planning, but with the worksheets and tips provided in the book, that will be much easier than it used to be.I read the book twice: once to get an idea of what all the worksheets were about and once to really read them with all the technical and practical details provided by Greenberg.Greenberg identifies 28 security elements, including 15 fundamental elements, (six of which are core elements), and 13 wrap-up elements. Core elements include things like authorization and access control, authentication, encryption, integrity, nonrepudiation, and privacy. Those may seem obvious, but Greenberg has a lot of useful things to say about them that others haven't said.Perhaps the most valuable part of the book is all the other elements, which we tend to forget, including addressing and routing (with tips on how to get those right from a security point of view), configuration management, directory services, time services, staff management, legal issues, and so on.I'd be interested to see some projects get implemented with Greenberg's methods. I think it should work quite well, although due to entropy, laziness, over-worked engineers, and other such factors, I would guess that some of the numerous worksheets will fall by the wayside. But I think Greenberg would be OK with that as long as most of the worksheets are maintained and the company adopts security as a way of thinking.In summary, this book is definitely worth reading, probably numerous times!"},{"Title":"Mission-Critical Security Planner: When Hackers Won't Take No for an Answer","review":"The truth is, hackers and other attackers won't take no for an answer, and while there is absolutely no way to stop attackers from trying; there are ways to stop them in their tracks.With that, Mission-Critical Security Planner is a surprisingly good book, aimed at someone looking to start developing their information security infrastructure. Rather than having to reinvent the wheel, the book provides planners with the framework and tools they need to create their information security infrastructure.One good feature of the book it is large collection of templates and worksheets on various security elements. .../The book is not overly technical and is quite good for those who need to get their security group up and running in a short timeframe.For those that are serious about security, they will find that Mission-Critical Security Planner is like a cookbook. They can use it to prepare their security as needed.Overall, Mission-Critical Security Planner is a very readable and useful book. Those who have an imperative to get their security groups up and running will find huge value in the book immediately."},{"Title":"Mission-Critical Security Planner: When Hackers Won't Take No for an Answer","review":"Greenberg advocates an actionable, meaningful security approach that doesn't get hung up on methodology or reliance on abstract standards, like DoD and other common standards. The book skewers bureaucracies that believe planning and methodology is an end in itself, yet recognizes key business realities facing security advocates and suggests practical approaches to &quot;selling security&quot; within an organization -- an important topic given tight or shrinking budgets.Greenberg is clearly a security guy and writes with experience and authority -- at times the style is conversational and humorous and at others professorial -- it is a good read for a security-focused text. While providing a strong overview of sound security planning and risk management concepts, MCSP also digs down and provides details where it counts regarding filters, proxies, IDS/VA, configuration management, content management (ActiveX, etc), and so forth yet consistently presents this low-level detail within the framework of an actionable security planning methodology that will be relevant five or even ten years from now. MCSP is anything but a security cookbook of technology discussions gleaned from public sources, although many basic concepts and topics are explained in the book's comprehensive glossary. Instead, the book presents the strengths and weaknesses of various technologies and approaches as they relate to the security improvement process.MCSP utilizes a sequence of sophisticated worksheets to guide the reader through the security planning process and create a dynamic, actionable security plan -- not a plan that lives on the shelf. Using Greenberg's approach there are three components to the Security Plan: Security Stack (physical, network, application, OS), Life-Cycle Stack (technology selection, implementation, operations, incident response), and Business (information, infrastructure, people). Interestingly, you may have noticed that the Security Stack is similar to the OSI model -- this is typical of the rational and logical approach throughout the book. Using the worksheet approach as a guide, the Security Plan is mapped to 28 pre-defined security elements addressing the core security planning challenges of a distributed computing environment. Based on the worksheets, the impact analysis method approach provides a readily understandable plan that reflects the specific business, technical, and lifecycle tradeoffs in your organization.Greenberg keeps it interesting with many anecdotes illustrating key points and thought-provoking arguments. For example, he advocates an approach that will hold vendors accountable for poor security by providing a quantifiable method for business software users to track security. The final chapter covers strategic security planning with PKI and provides a roadmap for selling an organization on the benefits of PKI when appropriate.MCSP is an innovative and useful security book. The book provides security staffers and planners with the logical framework and tools they need to create a comprehensive, living, and actionable security plan enabling the organization to shift from a reactive security posture to a more pro-active approach. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mission-Critical Security Planner: When Hackers Won't Take No for an Answer","review":"excellent reference material has been invaluable to me in the last week and has steered me into making some difficult choices easily"},{"Title":"Mission-Critical Security Planner: When Hackers Won't Take No for an Answer","review":"This book, especially if used in conjunction with the author's web site (see ASIN B0000C7RBX), is one of the most valuable additions to the IT security profession that I've read. My reasons for making this bold statement include:- The book provides a coherent and focused approach to developing and implementing a security plan. You can find numerous books on writing and implementing policies and procedures, or establishing a security posture, but this is the first book I've read that steps you through the process of conceiving, implementing and keeping alive a viable security plan.- By separating the process into three distinct domains (referred to as 'stacks') you ensure that your plan encompasses and integrates the technology, process and business elements into a coherent strategy.- Artifacts in the form of a complete set of worksheets provide a set of tools that give a framework and speed up the planning process.The planning approach set forth in the book is straightforward and realistic - you're led through the preliminaries, which includes conceiving a plan that matches your needs, and selling the plan to sponsors (an often overlooked, but essential activity when fighting for budget). The next step is to perform an impact analysis, and this is where the book shines, because the author focuses on business issues instead of technology. This promotes awareness and goes a long way towards getting buy-in and funding, as well as laying a solid foundation for a long-term security plan. Next the author shows how to select the correct security model and avoid common pitfalls. These lead to building organizational consensus - buy-in from all stakeholders. The difference between this step and the preliminary step of selling to a sponsor and obtaining funding, which is vertical, you need to promote the plan horizontally as well. The final steps are to implement and continuously refine the plan.Of course, the overview above only describes the approach contained within the book. There is much more to commend it, such as clear writing, superb page design that portrays information in graphs, illustrations and tables, and the details the author provides. There is not a single statement or recommendation that is unsupported, and the material is both sensible and accurate."},{"Title":"Mission-Critical Security Planner: When Hackers Won't Take No for an Answer","review":"What's mission critical at my company isn't somewhere else, but I had no idea how to figure that out, let alone write up the proposal for my boss until I came across Eric Greenberg's book. He has done all the work for you. All the forms are there and he's got a foolproof formula, so you don't ante up the money your company doesn't have for security you don't need."},{"Title":"Mission-Critical Security Planner: When Hackers Won't Take No for an Answer","review":"This book provides an easily-adaptable methodology for the development and implementation of a comprehensive security plan, while avoiding the pitfalls that doom most of these efforts to failure in the real world.Instead of being another technical &quot;How-To&quot; manual, Greenberg describes a process through which all stakeholders in company security can arrive at sensible business decisions, record those decisions in the provided worksheets, and put a consensus-driven, life-cycle security model into practice.The author first establishes a much-needed vocabulary for describing the values, risks, and vulnerabilities inherent in security decisions. The quantitative and qualitative approaches should be easily understood by executive management and operations staff alike, while the security models are sufficiently complex to describe the many challenges, yet familiar to experienced IT professionals (the &quot;security stack&quot;, for example, being based on the familiar OSI model).At the core of this book are the detailed worksheets, provided in both printed and editable form. But behind the worksheets are two gems not to be overlooked: the author's many inciteful and often-entertaining annecdotes, and an Aristotelian breakdown of security into easily-digestible components. Using a combination of these elements, a security professional could note the components in use at his site and, using the worksheets, quickly develop a security awareness which can be transformed into an effective security plan.I often found myself cheering Greenberg's observations, or muttering out loud, &quot;so true...so true...&quot;. As a system administrator often dealing with security issues, I have seen many security initiatives fail, and Greenberg's descriptions of the necessary ingredients for success line up perfectly with what I have personally experienced, and the success (or lack thereof) in eventual implementation.The author exhorts in the early pages of this book: &quot;....in the end, we will have to evaluate our ultimate commitment to security planning by what we do, not by what we say we should do.&quot; Ouch! But he's right, you know. For those that are truly committed to enhancing security in a complex or challenging environment: this book will put you on the fast-track toward achieving that goal."},{"Title":"Mission-Critical Security Planner: When Hackers Won't Take No for an Answer","review":"Eric Greenberg has put together an excellent book, at last someone has thought about planning security, instead of hacking security precautions on as an afterthought. Mr. Greenberg has obviously dived into his depth of experiences and amalgamated them into a coherent way to build a security strategy.Were the book really shines and that experience comes through is in realizing that security is not just about putting a lock on a door. It is about putting the procedures, hardware, software, people and most importantly the mindset into an organization in a cohesive way so that nothing is overlooked and the checks and balances are in place to validate every part of these measures. The author also understands the vital importance that security is all cost and benefit.By taking the overhead view and delving into the cracks in the armor organizations seldom think about, the book provides the templates for building that elusive security plan. These templates (worth the price of admission alone) are used in a step-by-step approach to replacing the haphazard security with a coherent, manageable, administrable, and most importantly, a downright implemental plan. And book doesn't just stop at getting the plan in place; it goes into the extremely vital and usually overlooked, \\"What happens next?\\" and builds the strategy for response, recovery, testing, support, procurement, integration, staging and training.This is a must-read for information security professionals and infrastructure planners."},{"Title":"Who Would Unbraid Her Hair : the Legend of Annie Mae","review":"Antoinette Nora Claypoole has unleashed a monster of a book that delves deeper into the mysteries surrounding the murder of Annie Mae Pictou-Aquash than many of her one-time friends and lovers will be comfortable with. The book, _Who would unbraid her hair: The legend of annie mae_, published by anam cara press, was released in November, 1999.Claypoole's book is, like Anna Mae's life, a harrowing journey into the maze of idealism, paranoia, and blind spots of Indian activism and its nemesis, the miscellaneous COINTELPRO operations run by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Claypoole's intentions for the book, as Anna Mae's for her life, are nothing but good: &quot;The continual intention of my work is to encourage a healing of the fear and sorrow, anger and injustice which surround the memory of Annie Mae, and to help her wondering spirit settle into her journey home&quot; (p. xiv). And in the end, both Anna Mae and Antoinette Nora were stymied, through no fault of their own, Anna Mae by a bullet through the back of her head, and Claypoole by a pervasive silence that still blankets Indian Country like a shroud.Don't let that harsh judgment keep you from reading Claypoole's book. It is indispensable. But understand that this is not a mystery novel that ends with an answer to the &quot;whodunit&quot; question; rather, it is a book that helps us to frame the questions that need to be asked. &quot;this is a book about silence and how it murders people. this is a book about breaking ancient rituals. of human sacrifice and tragedy&quot; (p. xxiv).Only those who read it in the hope of figuring out who did what to whom will be disappointed. Being able to place blame with someone who either pulled the trigger or ordered the trigger pulled is like trying to name the person who conducted or ordered the American holocaust. It's not that simple. As Claypoole herself puts it (p. 2), .&quot;..people want eyes for eyes, like that's some kind of [antidote] for fear. and i say it's anna mae's life we need to listen to. and telling her story is like telling all the stories. living in this way, some things are sacred despite the quest for 'justice' and power.&quot; The silence Claypoole heard so often during her quest for stories is itself a story. Listen to it...Background Annie Mae Pictou was born near Shubenacadie, Nova Scotia, March 17, 1945. A childhood of poverty, discomfiting Catholic schools, and grueling temporary jobs picking blueberries in Maine conspired to lead Annie Mae off the Mi'kmaq reserve in Canada and into Boston, Massachusetts in 1962. She married Jake Mahoney and gave birth to daughters Denise and Deborah by him before their marriage began to crumble in 1969.She helped to organize the Boston Indian Council in 1969, taking an active role in providing therapy for alcoholics, job-placement assistance, and after-school programs for children, all geared toward the Boston Indian community. She joined members of the American Indian Movement in 1970 on a Thanksgiving Day takeover of the Mayflower II in Boston harbor.When she heard that some of the friends she'd met on the Mayflower II were involved in the takeover and siege at Wounded Knee in early 1973, she left Boston with her new lover, Nogeeshik Aquash, and joined them. There, she did grunt work for the group, dug trenches, dodged bullets, delivered a baby of Mary soon-to-be Crow Dog, and was married to Aquash in a pipe ceremony performed by Wallace Black Elk.In the two and a half years that followed, Anna Mae rose to prominence among the AIM. By the summer of 1974, her marriage to Aquash was failing while her ties to AIM and to Dennis Banks, in particular, were strengthening. Her closeness with Banks effectively thrust her into a position of leadership. Banks and others allegedly sought her input on key decisions.Anna Mae's stature within AIM also put her in the sights of the FBI. Arrested and questioned repeatedly, she invariably was released with or without bond. When Doug Durham , &quot;chief&quot; of AIM security and a personal bodyguard of Dennis Banks, was uncovered as a federal informant, paranoia within AIM made everyone a suspect. Anna Mae, with her repeated arrests and seemingly favored treatment by the FBI, was tailored for the proverbial snitch jacket.Her body was found in a ravine on the eastern edge of the Pine Ridge reservation on February 24, 1976, by a rancher who was building a fence. Federal authorities contracted with a coroner, W. O. Brown, who apparently didn't notice the blood oozing from her skull or the bullet impaling her left temple. He ruled the cause of death as &quot;exposure,&quot; severed both of her hands for finger-printing, and buried her as &quot;Jane Doe&quot; in an unmarked grave.Silent Treatment Claypoole's book provides a good overview of the life of Annie Mae Pictou-Aquash. It provides a worthy complement to Johanna Brandt's _The life and death of Anna Mae Aquash_ (1978, 1993). Claypoole also sketches the environmental and political contexts in which Anna Mae lived. Headlines include the occupation of Alcatraz island in 1969, the occupation of Fort Lawton in 1970 and its return to Indian ownership in Seattle, the Trail of Broken Treaties leading to the takeover of the BIA building in Washington, D.C., in 1972, the siege at Wounded Knee, 1973, and the shoot-out at the Jumping Bull ranch in 1975 that led to the incarceration of Leonard Peltier as a political prisoner.While it covers history and broaches biography, _Who would unbraid her hair_ is neither a history book nor a biography - at least, not in the ordinary sense of those genres. Interviews, prose, poetry, and journal entries are juxtaposed throughout the text. It makes for a lively read, and one that is packed with the kind of emotion, suspense, and frustration that absorbed political activists of days gone by.Many readers are apt to find the interviews and attempts at interviews of former friends and lovers of Annie Mae the most frustrating. In the closing couplet of a poem, Claypoole suggests that she was &quot;working on a story no one wants to tell&quot; (p. 46). I suspect that some of Claypoole's contacts who refused to comment will be anxious to pick up her book to make sure they were not misquoted.The silence has been broken intermittently, as with public allegations that John Boy Patton pulled the trigger while Arlo Looking Cloud and Theda Nelson Clark looked on. Others have been named in addition to those three. Rob Robideau says that Frank Dillon stood next to Patton at the execution. Unnamed sources of News From Indian Country say that David Hill and Clyde Bellecourt were &quot;there,&quot; too, and that another carload of AIM members was on its way to try to stop the execution, but arrived &quot;too late.&quot;The latest breach of silence was initiated by Robert Pictou-Branscombe, a cousin of Anna Mae, who recently charged national AIM leaders with ordering the execution. Russell Means held a press conference in Denver to endorse Branscombe's charges. Vernon Bellecourt issued a statement denying those charges and indicting Means and Ward Churchill.These allegations have never been tested or challenged in court most of the allegations are sufficiently vague that specific criminal indictments could never be mustered against any of those charged."},{"Title":"Who Would Unbraid Her Hair : the Legend of Annie Mae","review":"This book begins with a five page list of AIM casualites that occured on Pine Ridge Reservation between the years of 1973-1976.

One of the documented homicides is Annie Mae Pictou, a 30 year old AIM leader and mother of 2 small daughters.

That's the personal aspect that resonates with me, and I am deeply thankful to Helen Humphreys for capturing all the pain, love, longing, and faith that these real people experienced.But enough of that... this book is a small prose miracle. Others here have stated and summarized the main plot, so I won't repeat it. The idea of gardening, of nurturing both the earth and one's soul is not a particularly novel (pardon the pun) idea. What IS different here is the magnificent way in which Humphreys tells this story in the first person (not as easy at is seems) with such passion, poetry, and compassion.Humphreys' way with words, with describing the gardens, the pain of loss, the longing of love unrequited, the miracle of growth, is stunning. \\"Grief moves us like love. Grief is love, I suppose. Love as a backward glance.\\" These words by our heroine, Gwen, are as bittersweet as the novel, as bittersweet as her love affair with roses, as bittersweet as her unspoken attraction to Capt. Raley, one of the Canadian soldiers billeted nearby.As she says early in the book, in one of these backward glances, \\"I sit in this rocking train carriage, years later, words floating around me, wisping down in thin, grey threads. Nothing I can hold in my hands. Smoke, these words are smoke.\\"Gwen recalls overhearing Jane, another of the young woman employed to grow food for the war, read aloud from Wolff's \\"To the Lighthouse\\" to one of the Canadian soldiers. As Gwen puts it, \\"and when I hear that voice [Jane's] polishing those words so that they shine inside me...\\" Well, all I can say is that Helen Humphreys' words also truly shine."},{"Title":"The Lost Garden (Beeler Large Print Series)","review":"It's 1941 and London is burning. Gwen Davis (35 and a horticulturist formerly seeking a cure for parsnip canker) must now flee the city she loves, so she's volunteered to lead a team of girls from the Women's Land Army in growing vegetables for the war effort at an old country estate. The estate is beautiful, but it soon becomes apparent the girls have better things to do than plant potatoes -- they have a company of Canadian soldiers billeted in the old estate house right in their backyard. The soldiers are commanded by the bitter, secretly terrified Captain Raley, who immediately snares Gwen's long lost fancy. While the girls dance with the soldiers, she tracks Raley down, seeking to cement a relationship destined to haunt her. Neither can she forget the novelist Virginia Woolf, who's tragic death has left her with fantasized fan letters she can never send. But it's her discovery of a secret love garden hidden behind the orchard, long overgrown and lost to whomever planted it, that truly leads Gwen to explore her dormant longings. While her best friend, Jane, is fiercely trying to keep her missing fiance alive by remembering him and while the land army girls are depicting their former lives in chalk on blackout curtains, Gwen is tracing the meanings of the flowers in her lost garden in search of what she knows of love.THE LOST GARDEN is truly a beautiful book -- straightforward and yet told with such sensitivity and understanding it's impossible not to get caught up in it. Gwen's idea of a drunken orgy is to get \\"very sincere\\" and start rhapsodizing on plants, and her incredibly straight view of love and life makes the poignancy all the stronger. Captain Raley's repressed fear, knowing he is just waiting to be sent out to die, had me crying by the end of the book. In fact, I cried all the way through the last chapter. Though Gwen never gets to know the land girls well (she secretly names them after potatoes), Jane and Raley and Gwen herself are excellently developed. I'm the sort of reader who thrives on constant action, yet this touching little book had me from the first word and never let go.A brilliant portrayal of love in a time of war, THE LOST GARDEN is a literary arrangement I could not recommend more highly."},{"Title":"The Lost Garden (Beeler Large Print Series)","review":"I loved her Afterimage which is in my top ten favorite books. I like her prose in both the books, it's sort of poetic and lyrical but uncomplicated. (Although, I liked it better in Afterimage. In this book, at times it sounds a bit pretentious like she is trying too hard to sound deep and flowery but that's just a few places in the beginning.) She has a way with words that evoke an incredible imagery when you read it. I get caught up in her expression of the language that I don't even care if the plot seemed a bit contrived at certain places.This book is a quick read...it's rather short.Like a previous reviewer mentioned, Gwen beings to piece together the story the garden has to tell, which is also her own story...of Love, Longing and Loss.She runs a few metaphors and threads describing past events throughout the book, alongside the main setting, and by the time the book ends, the connection is thrown in and you realize their purpose. They throw a little insight into the main character's thought process and complete the theme - it is much better done subtly this way. Like with the Virginia Woolf thread in this book. It goes with the overall theme of lost chances. The thread with Gwen's mother is also about Loss, though a bit over-dramatic. The thread with the white roses and Raley are tied symbolically by Love. The threads with David's longing for his wife and the Genus and Jane's topiary Angel...the symbolism of longing.If somebody recommended a book to me about gardens, I would have found it drab and boring. And I especially don't read many stories with a war backdrop. I'm not wired to relate to or pick up a book like that. But I'm so glad I read this one. Another reviewer has said, &quot;Anyone who enjoys a creative expression will like the book.&quot; I will add that, anyone who normally doesn't care for it should definitely read it. You will start smelling the roses."},{"Title":"The Lost Garden (Beeler Large Print Series)","review":"Helen Humphreys is nothing less than a superb story-teller. The tone of this W.W.II drama is lyrical, wistful and bold, and her characters bend and sway in the nostalgia she so openly releases. It is narrated by Gwen Davis a single 30-something horticulturist who joins the war effort by volunteering to lead a group of girls in growing potatoes on a deserted estate in the English countryside. Used to working in a solitary lab environment, Gwen has to face her shyness and lack of self-confidence as she forms her relationships with the girls in her crew. Her amateur gardeners are young and energetic and would rather be flirting with the soldiers who are also stationed at the estate while awaiting deployment. One of the girls, however, is different... Jane. Since Jane's fianc&eacute; has been declared missing in action she's been slowing fading away, just barely holding onto that fragile thread of hope. Jane and Gwen befriend one another, as well as two of the soldiers staying in the estate house. Then Gwen finds the best companion of all... a secret garden hidden within the grounds. With her knowledge of horticulture and some research into the inhabitants of the estate, Gwen beings to piece together the story the garden has to tell... and finds that it is telling her story as well.If someone would've told me that I'd learn quite a lot about gardening techniques while reading this book, I might have passed it up, because I wouldn't have realized that there is a beautiful and sensitive language gardens can speak. I think any reader who enjoys creative expression will find they can relate to this story. Humphreys delivers her tale with perfect timing, swiftly wrapping-up after the climax, yet leaving just enough loose threads to keep you thinking about the characters long after the last page has been turned."},{"Title":"The Lost Garden (Beeler Large Print Series)","review":"Helen Humphreys' The Lost Garden is a beautiful little gem of a novel, a quick and wonderful read about one woman's perfect moment and time and how it quickly eluded her. Gwen Davis is a lonely woman in the early days of World War II in London when she volunteers to lead a group of women in a war-effort farming experiment on an abadoned estate in the British countryside. She is devastated to leave London, devastated by the war and yet her experiences away from London turn out to be the most rewarding of her life. She finally forms a meaningful friendship and begins to fall in love with one of the Canadian soldiers briefly stationed at the estate. Gwen reflects on the nature of love and happiness, both in her life and in the lives of those around her. This is an excellent, if short, rewarding novel.

A bunch of elements that really intrigued me, especially a lost garden and the setting being the war era, which holds a strange fascination for me.This is a beautiful and well-written novel. The prose is flowery but flows well; the author is indeed a gifted writer. There were some parts of the story line for which I just didn't care, but overall I enjoyed it.One thing I liked most about this novel was the detailed descriptions of the suffering of London during the bombings. As Americans I think we are rather ignorant of how much the people of our mother land suffered, and this was definitely eye-opening. I appreciated the perspective.It's short and a quick read. I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Lost Garden (Beeler Large Print Series)","review":"This is a quick read and is full of beautiful language and imagery. The characters are interesting and the discovery of the garden keeps the reader engaged.

Love as a backwards glance.\\"There is the kind of love that permits us to simply share pieces of our lives, our memories. The kind of love where one will say, \\"Tell me something.\\" And we do.There is the love of books and good writing.

Weeping silently, Gwen listens to her friend Jane read aloud the closing pages of TO THE LIGHTHOUSE, and she realizes -\\"I will never be closer to her than now. The book is the shared experience, the shared intimacy ...

WWII makes London a more dangerous place to live every day as bombs destroy sections of the city. The main character is Gwen, a lonely 35-year-old woman living in London and working in a laboratory. Her occupation as horticulturist provides her the opportunity to volunteer to lead a Land Woman's Group - several young girls who will plant gardens for the good of the war effort on a beautiful estate somewhere in the English countryside. A group of young Canadian men live nearby on the estate as they await orders to be sent into combat.Gwen discovers a secret garden that was created in honor of longing, loss and faith. She becomes friends with Jane who is waiting for news of her soldier fianc&eacute; reported missing. And she has an attraction to Raley, the CO of the Canadian men.The language is poetic and often quite lovely. The story is pretty good, but not great. There are a few flaws in the novel. The voices of Gwen, Jane and Raley are too similar. I thought the novel started off a bit pretentious, but as it continued, I found myself admiring the turn of a phrase or a clever metaphor. The author seems to bear her soul in this novel and I found it refreshing and courageous. This book was short, but so full of sadness.

Everything about this book is unusual - its context, characters and incredibly sensitive development of the story. There are turns of phrase that will catch you completely off guard.

It's clear from the beginning that the author is working really hard to be lyrical & passionate, & is in love with her own writing. It makes it impossible to enjoy the story, because the author's desperate effort is so obvious. Near the end she confirmed my suspicions when she writes, \\"When a writer writes, it's as if she holds the sides of her chest apart, exposes her beating heart. And even though everything wants to heal, to close over and protect the heart, the writer must keep it bare, exposed. And in doing this, all of life is kept back, all the petty demands of the day-to-day. The heart is a river. The act of writing is the moving water that holds the banks apart, keeps the muscle of words flexing so that the reader can be carried along by this movement\\".Blech."},{"Title":"The Lost Garden (Beeler Large Print Series)","review":"Miss Humphreys understands the human need of loving and to be love.

There is a regiment of Canadian soldiers on the estate as well and Gwen finds herself drawn to their commander, Captain Raley, but what is it she feels? What is love exactly to someone who has never felt its essence? Raley himself is adrift as he mourns the loss of his best friend.

It is a journey of blossoming through longing, to love, as the war in Europe looms and Gwen's love for Raley may actually be doomed for reasons she never considered. \\"The Lost Garden\\" is a joyous bouquet that is both patient and anxious, and whose scent will linger in the hair and clothes of every reader."},{"Title":"Who Says There Are No Jobs Out There?: 25 Irreverent Rules for Getting a Job","review":"Bob Weinstein has built a career on advising you about yours.

It was written by my wife's grandmother's sister, who was the general secretary of the YWCA in China from 1903 to 1911, then returned to the US and worked for the Y for several years. It is a remarkable observation of the lives of women in China, Japan, India, Turkey, and Latin America during the early 20th century. It also contained most interesting reflections on the lives of the young women employed by the Y who went into mission outposts at that time - what kind of preparation they had before being sent to their mission posts and what the mission environment was like.At that time, most women were marrying, having children, and running households. Those, such as A. Estelle Paddock who remained single and worked outside the home, can offer powerful and helpful role models even today, a century later.The book is out of print and in the public domain.

His girlfriend got pregnant the previous year, decided that she couldn't handle raising the baby, and Sam felt a need to raise his son. Now, Sam's going to an alternative high school and juggling classes, college hopes...and baby Max. The mix only gets tougher when he meets Claire, a fellow teenage parent who Sam definitely has feelings for. Yet no matter what happens, Sam is determined to prove to the world that he's not a stupid teenage guy and that he CAN hang on to Max.Like I said, this is definitely a book that needed to be written and needs to be read. Many of us at some point or another have read the typical \\"pregnant teenage girl\\" novels and they certainly offer valuable perspectives. Yet it seems that we rarely come into contact with novels that explore a MALE's feelings about the issue. \\"Hanging Onto Max\\" definitely corrects this problem.But \\"Hanging Onto Max\\" is more than just a mediocre novel with a rarely-done perspective- its main character is just as memorable as the content. I literally checked this book out from the library, read the first page, and raced through the novel until I finished it.Sam is just that kind of a character. He is realistically \\"male\\" without being a stereotype, and his thoughts and words reverberate with a piercing, understated truth. Flashbacks of Sam's experiences with his girlfriend and of life \\"before\\" are also unusually well done. Through them, Bechard managed to perfectly capture Sam's previous experiences and thus allow the reader to understand his current situation better. As I read, I felt like Sam was really a person-he is one of those characters you literally feel a \\"warmth\\" and empathy toward. The writing is blunt, quick, and free of pretentious prose. This only makes Sam better.Without a doubt, \\"Hanging Onto Max\\" succeeds at exploring one of the toughest issues. Not only is it from an intriguing male perspective, it deals with the issue of teen pregnancy with realism, empathy, and a fearlessness when it comes to exploring the gut-wrenching choices that those involved must make."},{"Title":"Hanging on to Max","review":"I just finished this book today and was very impressed.This is the story of Sam.

Everyone admires him for accepting the responsibility although he feels awkward at his alternative school with the daycare program where he's the only MALE single parent.Max is prepared to give up any hopes of college or a life of his own, agreeing to become a construction worker after he graduates this, his senior year, of high school to pay back his dad for all the baby expenses. Then, she comes along.He never forgot Claire, the girl he'd had a crush on since the 6th grade who he left behind at his regular high school along with his best friend Andy. Now she reappears in his life with her infant daughter Emily. As they adjust to newfound parenthood together while trying to forge a relationship, Sam tries to become used to this new routine although a part in him cries out for something more, that will lead to the ultimate life-changing decision: can he keep Max?This sad, but sweet tale will leave you pitying the main characters and wondering what you'd do in Sam's place.

At such a young age, he struggles with balancing school, studying for the SATs, and falling in love again.The book Hanging on to Max has many significant lessons that can be learned throughout it. One important message the author tries to send out to young teens is to think about the consequences that could happen before acting on impulse. This is suddenly a problem for Sam and Brittany when they find out that she is going to have a baby. Suddenly, they have a bigger problem that they could've imagined. When Brittany decides to give up the baby for adoption, Sam has to deal with even more, because he makes the tough decision of keeping the baby. Sam's whole world will soon be all about Max and being a good father. Instead of worrying of making varsity basketball and his plans for Friday night, he has to worry about midnight feedings and making ends meet.Though the book sends a strong and realistic message, some teens may find it to be unrealistic. Just when Sam seems to be coping with the responsibility that comes with the baby, he makes the decision to give him up. Most readers see this as a shock because adoption never really seemed to be a choice. Another thing that might be unappealing about this book is that it moves somewhat slowly. Readers might see Sam's reality as uneventful and dull, but the fact is that having a baby changes your life dramatically.Overall this book is a great way to show just how realistic this situation is, and how it can happen if you don't take responsibility for your actions. This book teaches teenagers to take a step back and look at what could possibly happen to them or someone they love."},{"Title":"Hanging on to Max","review":"Hanging on to Max was an awesome story.

He was transferred away from his friends to a school where they watched after Max, (his baby) while he went to class.

It is very sad, and worth every penny spent on buying it."},{"Title":"Hanging on to Max","review":"Hanging On To MaxYou think you know what this book will be. Teen father raises baby. Issues follow. Yes. And no. The usual approach is to show young man growing into his responsibilities, lots of diapering fiascoes, etc. Author Margaret Bechard finds new ground. Why is Sam raising Max? To show he is a good guy? To take responsibility? As punishment for disappointing his father? How many lives will be damaged if Sam hangs onto Max?This thought provoking YA has scenes that are heartbreaking as well as funny. The scene where 17 year old Sam, after a year of isolation as he immerses himself in the baby, meets with old friends and plays basketball, then drops to the wet grass and simply-relaxes-is stunning. You'll love Sam, you'll love Max and the end-isn't an ending at all. I'm going to read this one again."},{"Title":"Hanging on to Max","review":"I very much enjoyed the book Hanging on to Max for many reasons. I liked how it portrayed Sam's character as not just another irresponsible teenager. The author's writing style of using flashbacks had the reader itching to get to the next chapter. I think the author grasped the hardships of being a teenager perfectly. It was a book I could really relate to. It is a book about a typical teenage boy named Sam and his life.

Sam's story showed the internal conflict many teenage parents have. It not only showed the daily struggles he went through, but also the overall change it made on his life. You also saw the changes not only affected him but everyone in his life.

Sam is taking care of Max and Claire just wants to help out.My favorite part of the story was when Sam and Claire went to the park with Max and Emily. Since Max never seems to get out of the house, he is really excited to be at the park. Claire bought some duck food, so they could feed the ducks. Max absolutely adores ducks and tries to get out of his seat to reach them. When the duck quacks, Max says \\"Bap.\\" He keeps on saying \\"Bap\\" over and over, and it was really cute.

Sam is in high school and has a lot going for him, when he finds out that his girlfriend is pregnant. She gives birth to a son, Max, and wants to put him up for adoption. Sam will not let this happen, so he takes care of Max by himself. Sam has to get through many obstacles throughout the novel, that most teenagers don't have to endure. He matures greatly and has to live his life on a very stressful schedule. The friends that Sam makes at his parenting school are not similar to him, because they are all mothers. He does not have a lot of people who can truly understand what he goes through. Sam has goals that he wants to accomplish, even though having Max is a large setback. Being a father keeps getting harder for Sam and he isn't being fair to Max. He has a big decision to make, should he give Max to a more qualified family or keep him and try his best.

It is one of my all time favoriet books. It will tie you in and you will love it forever.

Margaret Bechard writes very realistically of the challenges that face teen parents, while not making excuses for the mistakes her characters make. This novel is very short and concisely written, yet manages to convey a world of emotions. The ending, in particular, is very well written and plausible. This is a book that teens are sure to love as it addresses many issues that are important to them, and does it in a humorous, non-judgmental way."},{"Title":"Hanging on to Max","review":"The door banged open. \\"Sam!\\" It was Claire, her voice shrill and panicky. \\"Sam!

Most teens will love this book because it deals with a popular issue, teen pregnancy."},{"Title":"Hanging on to Max","review":"I read this book in 3 days. It was really good I think it shows a good reality of being a teen parent and a single one at that. Part wishes they could just go hang out like they use too but then they have a responsibility to the child that did not ask to be conceived. I loved every part of this book from Sam's struggles to his flash backs which were very nicely done. I think Sam showed true devotion to Max and that I was proud of, even though it was a fictional story.

YA books on the subject are common to the point of clich&eacute;. However, Hanging Onto Max is the old story with a new twist: Sam Pettigrew is a teenaged father.He took custody of his son at age sixteen, when the boy's mother decided she could no longer handle the pressures of child care. Sam didn't want to see little Max given away to strangers, but raising him by himself was just as difficult. He certainly didn't get much help from his widowed father. Sam's dad agreed to support Sam financially until he graduated high school, but then Sam had to go to work immediately and pay back every penny. Sam, who scored 1320 on his SAT, would have to give up his dream of engineering school. But it was worth it to hold onto Max...wasn't it?Transferring away from his friends to an alternative high school that provided day care, Sam struggled to juggle the responsibilities of school and fatherhood. He never had a minute to himself and hardly ever saw his old friends. But he had to keep Max, right? After all, Sam was all the baby had in the world. However, one day when Sam turned his back for two minutes and Max got into an accident and ended up in the emergency room, he realized his could not go on. Hanging onto Max wasn't helping anybody, especially Max himself.This was a very good story, hilarious in some places and heart-tearing in others. I could sympathize with Sam and understand his motivations and even why his dad was the way he was. My only objection is to the final chapter, when Sam is reunited with a now-grown-up Max. It seemed anticlimatic and was not necessary in my opinion. Other than that I thought this was a fine book."},{"Title":"Hanging on to Max","review":"I loved the book... all the way up to like the last two pages.

Will Sam give up Max so he can go to college?I believe that this book can relate to alot of teens who have a child and are raising their baby on their own."},{"Title":"Hanging on to Max","review":"17-year-old Sam has taken custody of his newborn son and with the help of his own father, is adjusting to fatherhood while trying to maintain life as a high school senior.The novel explores the emotional rollercoasters teen parents might face without glorifying or simplifying it. This book is a refreshing one, not only for its teen male perspective, but for its lack of propaganda against teen sex.Bechard acknowledges that teenagers have sex and become parents without adopting a scolding tone in what could have easily become a 200-page advertisement for abstinence. Instead, she depicts a realistic look at teenagers struggling to find themselves in their new roles as parents. They've become parents, a situation that cannot be reversed. What to do now? Only Sam can answer that question for himself and Max. This book takes you on the journey as Sam and his peers try to find their answers.Since the book's core themes relate to daily life, not just teen parenting, the book is really for anyone who's ever struggled (or is currently struggling) with a sense of a lost identity. It made me think about who I am as a person, and how I came to be the way I am."},{"Title":"Hanging on to Max","review":"Sam's girlfriend is pregnant and wants to give up the baby, so it's up to Sam to take custody when his son is born.

That book is also about two teens, girl gets pregnant, doesn't want baby. Boy gets baby and struggles with raising it and going to school. His father is also single and starts helping. I think I prefer the original."},{"Title":"Hanging on to Max","review":"I will not summarize the book, as others have already done an excellent job, but I will speak to its effectiveness in the classroom. I am an ESOL teacher who is frustrated with trying to find high interest, lower reading level books for high-schoolers. The other catch is that the students have to read AR books for their other English class and the books that I have on their level are only worth 1 point. This book is level 3.3 and worth 5 AR points. That makes it accessible to lower level students, while still holding the interest of more advanced readers. The added benefit is that the students can get their AR grade at the same time.There are cultural references that need explanation from time to time, but overall, students are interested in the topic and entertained by the characters lives. The fact that it is a boy raising a child makes it of interest to both boys and girls."},{"Title":"Hanging on to Max","review":"Seriously the most depressing book I've ever read.

But, I proved myself wrong after reading less than a page. I knew this story would hold a special place in my heart - And now that I've finished it, it does.Without leaking too much of the plot, Sam [The main character and father of baby Max] is dealing with so much stress. I loved how the book went back and forth from present day text, discussing what was going on at that moment, and then the next chapter was a flashback which helped you understand a bit of Sam's thoughts and actions.The ending of this story wanted to make me cry, I am positive it will tug at your heart strings as well.

It was a good read, realistic dialogue, and had engaging characters. However, it was as if the author got tired of writing at the end.

It was too abrupt for me."},{"Title":"Hanging on to Max","review":"This is a book any teenager considering having sex should read because it points out the difficulties of having a baby in high school.

Max was once a popular athlete with everything going for him. He had a beautiful girlfriend, great friends, and good grades. However, his life changed drastically when his girlfriend got pregnant. Taking care of a baby is exceptionally difficult, especially when you're only a kid yourself. Hanging onto Max was one of the best books I've read. It had a way of grasping my attention and holding onto it tightly. I constantly found myself eager to read more."},{"Title":"Hanging on to Max","review":"Hanging Onto Max was a very good book to read. It talked about issues that a teenager my age would be going through. I felt comfortable reading it and discussing it with fellow classmates. The main character, Sam is the father who is trying to make the best of his life and his sons. He shows maturity and also his ability to stay a teenager at heart. I enjoyed reading about Max's little fusses and how Sam would deal with them. Sam's stuggle to keep a low profile about having a child showed throught the entire book. I didn't appriciate that too much. Plus the readimg level was too easy for my interest."},{"Title":"Hanging on to Max","review":"Surprisingly this was the first book I've ever enjoyed reading besides Son of the Mob. At the end of each chapter, I just didn't want to put it down. There was so much emotion and painstaking hours that Sam spent to assure that Max was okay. I look up to any 17 year old that could do what Sam Pettigreau did.I think thats awesome for a 17 year old to act on adult responsibilities when they were needed.I would reccomend the book to just about anyone. The book could keep anyone hooked on it, waiting, wanting to read more, it's just that interesting. The story line was great, it was intense, overall fun to read throughout the whole book. All i wanted to do was read it all this book all the time, and that's something i \\"RARELY\\" ever do, along with actually for once in my life bringing this book home. Thats truely a first for me, it was just that good."},{"Title":"Dare To Repair Your Car: A Do-It-Herself Guide to Maintenance, Safety, Minor Fix-Its, and Talking Shop","review":"This book comes to the aid of women (and men) who don't have a clue about their car's interior workings. The authors don't claim to be experts, but consulted mechanics, government agencies and car manufacturers to get the info a novice needs. It tells you what to check if the heater isn't working, and what to do if you get a flat tire. Preventive tips like checking the air pressure in the tire and checking the oil get covered as well.There are do-it-yourself as well as do-it-for-me sections, so you will know what you can tackle or what you need help with."},{"Title":"Dare To Repair Your Car: A Do-It-Herself Guide to Maintenance, Safety, Minor Fix-Its, and Talking Shop","review":"This is a really good guide, not only is it for girls who dont know what a dipstick is, but its also for men and women alike, who have a basic understanding of the inner workings of their cars and would like a guide book to help them with repairs. Every chapter in the book has a do-it-yourself section where you can learn to replace your fueses or clean your fuel injectors. There is also some preventitive maint tips to keep your car from NEEDING un-needed repairs. The diagrams are pretty dumbed down, which can get a little annoying at times, but its good so even the novice can understand, and its fairly obvious the book was written for women (aside from the Betsy on the cover) because the text has a bit of a girly feel to it. There are a few blurbs here and there with some cute humorous parts to it, which makes this also a fun, enjoyable read.This is a great book to have around the house for when you need it.

It was a waste of what I did spend. One would think, that by looking at the cover and title, that this book would be about actually working on your car. It is not. It basically tells you to take your car to the mechanic every other page. I was very excited when I first opened the book, and flipped through the index, and it had a section titled \\"DIY: clean your fuel injectors\\" I was wanting to do this so I flipped to the corresponding page. It described how to pour injector cleaner into the gas tank.I kept on flipping through, and found more wastes of time,and even some incorrect information.I used to own a copy of \\"Auto Repair for Dummies\\" I intended to order that, but ordered this instead because it was cheaper.

It glamorizes China Marines from the 3os, ultra-wealthy officers flaunting Marine discipline, excessive romatic encounters and little of the hard slogging by WWII Marines. The entire book is about Marine intelligence which is of some interest but not really the \\"Battleground\\" of the title."},{"Title":"Battleground (Cassette)","review":"I picked up these books hoping to gain some insight into the actions of the Marine Corps in the Pacific during World War II. What I found instead was a sort of soap opera that rambles on for hundreds of pages without getting around to much actual fighting. For example, The Marines don't even get to Guadalcanal (their first major offensive) until the end of book III, some 1200 pages into the story. Those 1200 intervening pages are mostly conversations (ad nauseam) between stateside Marine Corps officers as they sit around headquarters, or go out on the town chasing skirts.The small portion of the books that is devoted to actual battles is done in such a cursory fashion that you're left with the impression that the author either finds this aspect of the Marines' mission distasteful, or doesn't understand it well enough to write about it. Mr. Griffin could have deleted about 80% of his material, and would have ended up with better books, albeit still not good ones.If you're the sort of person who likes to watch daytime soap operas, then you may enjoy these books. If, on the other hand, you're interested in military history, the banality of these books will leave you screaming in frustration."},{"Title":"Battleground (Cassette)","review":"I have read every WEB Griffen Novel out there, and now, bored with other authors, I am reading them all over again.

The book runs from June 4 - August 24, 1942. It was during this time that the Americans invaded Guadalcanal, and Griffin's version of this bloody battle in the Solomon Islands is a page turner. We also get to know Griffin's main characters really well. People like Fleming Pickering, Charley Galloway and many others. This book has lots of characters and I think it would be hard to keep them all straight if a person read this book out of context. I recommend that the best way to read this Corps series is in order. It also makes it easier to follow the progress of WWII. I love Griffin's characters, but the history that I get from these books is wonderful too.

Flem Pickering continues to grow in importance to the ongoing tale of incredible heroisim exhibited by the young Marines thrown into bloody conflict.&quot;Battleground&quot; details some of the terrible privations experienced by the First Marine division on the 'Canal and the coastwatchers on Buka island.

However, the first two books in The Corps series were much better.

Very little combat story here. Some parts were interesting such as the plight of the coast watchers manning the Australian defense line but these passages were short and lacked followup. A waste of valuable ink when page after page delves into the view of a female nurse's breasts while attending a wounded Marine flyer.

I've moved to Kindle because I would rather store e-books for re-reading than physical books. While reading the Web Griffin war series, 11 books total, I think, I was appalled at the grammar, spelling, and typos. They were terrible! In additon, the facts were incorrect in the kindle versions. In one chapter they might talk about Bill Smith as the C Company XO and in the very next chaptr say that John Jones was the C Company XO. In addition, geograhic place names were incorrect. I was thoroughly disgusted with the Kindle versions of the Web Griffin war series. The originals are very good. Something bad happened during the conversion to e-books. Another problem was the placement of dashes as continuation symbols. When a word is broken at the end of the line you have a partial word, a dash, and the rest of the word at the beginning of the next line. In these books, the continuation dashes were all over the place and often the dash had a space before, after, or both. That is completely wrong!Suggestion: Buy and read the series. Leave your editor cap in the closet.End."},{"Title":"Gemini Man","review":"Steinberg does an excellent job of setting up a &quot;straw man&quot; protagonist (the female psychologist), then switching reader identification in an unexpected direction.

Quit your day job Mr. Steinberg - You have arrived!"},{"Title":"Gemini Man","review":"Steinberg came up with an interesting plot idea. However, his writing ability isn't strong enough to cause you to care about the characters and ,more importantly, about the outcome of the story. Overall, I'd rate The Gemini Man as &quot;fair&quot;."},{"Title":"Gemini Man","review":"I was walking through one of the outlets of a bookshop chain that had gone bankrupt when I came across Gemini Man. Seeing as how everything was 50% off, I picked it up along with several other books. For a few weeks it just sat there on my bookshelf until finally, with nothing left to read, I picked it up. I took it down the shore with me and two days later, I was a Richard Steinberg fan. Even the beautiful scenery of the ocean (and the women that play in it) couldn't pull me away from this book. It was utterly amazing. The whole concept of the book is so new and fresh that you have no choice but to read it. But be warned. Once you pick this book up you won't put it down. It's great from start to finish. A must for anyone interested in a good story with just the right amount of action. The Gemini Man is by far one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Gemini Man","review":"With the tag line on the cover of \\"He was trained to be our deadliest weapon. Now he's our worst nightmare....\\" I expected more action. Nonetheless, I enjoyed this novel. It is the first book of Steinberg's I've read, and I'll read more from him.I liked the premise, and I liked the main character, however, like other people here have pointed out, I would have enjoyed knowing more about the main character and what he was thinking and what was driving him toward the actions he took. But maybe Steinberg wanted us to fill in those gaps ourselves, after all, this was more psychological than action oriented.While I did enjoy this book, one thing bothered me. Steinberg, not once, but twice in the text, used the old myth of driving nose bones up into the brain. The one time he suggested it, and the other time he killed a person this way. This is a myth that I wish would not be perpetuated in different formats. To Steinberg's credit, the martial art TV show Human Weapon said the same thing in an episode last year, so if a martial art documentary can't even get it right I won't fault an author too much.Personally, I'd enjoy a sequel to this novel. I'd like to see where Newman goes next. I'd like to see more into his thoughts. I'd like to see the others like him. I think there is potential to go deeper into this story and add more psychology and more action.Bottom line, I enjoyed it and that's why I read novels.Reviewed by Alain Burrese, author of Hard-Won Wisdom From the School of Hard Knocks."},{"Title":"Gemini Man","review":"Richard Steinberg managed to grab my attention in the first few pages with this well-written and crafty novel. I enjoyed the plot line and Steinberg's ability to only feed the reader as much information as was needed to keep the story flowing. There was never really a point in the novel where I knew EXACTLY where Steinberg was leading me.I liked the fact that this book demonstrated the ability for humans to be formed by instruction and/or manipulation, which can lead to unbelievable changes and amazing behavior. The American espionage agent Brian Newman makes for a great character. But it was even more interesting to read about how the people around him reacted to his reputation when they came in his presence. He is a man to be feared, respected, and quite possibly killed for the safety of mankind (or at least the people who have to be around him).This is a novel that delves deep into the recesses of government plots and the human mind; and does both very well. This is a hard book to stop reading, and with a few small failures - corny lines like Newman saying, after six years of captivity, \\"I must say, I approve of the direction skirt lengths are going.\\" or the fact that the guards pulled back the hammer on their weapons, when in all likelihood the guards would have had hammerless weapons. None of this takes away from the overall really awesome writing style of Richard Steinberg. As soon as I finish writing this review, I am going to see what else this author has written. I hope there's more out there!If you looking for a captivating read, you've found it! Buy a copy, new or used, and if you can't find that, check it out at the library. It is a good read!See ya next review."},{"Title":"Gemini Man","review":"Gemini Man is a good bood but lacks a lot of direction. While the main charachter is interesting and very \\"deep\\", we never get to see much because the book is muddled with non essential plot. I much prefer and would recommend Steinbergs The Four Phase Man, as it depicts the insides of lethal assassins actually doing what they are trained to do and in the midst struggling to find peace. Much more interesting and the story actually ends and doesn't leave you asking yourself, \\"Why in the world did I just read this book?\\"Great main charachter, just wish we could have seen more of him in action."},{"Title":"Gemini Man","review":"If you, like myself, have been searching for an author that captures you like the early Ludlum, Morrel or Lustbader, then look no further.

I hope there is a sequel out there in the future!also recommend: All Richard Steinberg's and Steve Alten's books"},{"Title":"Gemini Man","review":"Relatively little suspense; ridiculous characterizations, extremely unlikely plot. Steinberg's _Nobody's Safe_ shows he can write; this book just shows that he needed some more practice after he wrote it."},{"Title":"Gemini Man","review":"First let me state that I listened to the abridged (2 tape) audio book version of this book, so the full story could have made my enjoyment of the book rise a notch. All in all, the book was pretty good. It had a good premise and a lot of potential. However, the author didn't go far enough -- in other words, he should have been a little more daring and thrown more action into the book -- anything to raise the suspense level a little higher. But, based on what I read, the author is worth another shot."},{"Title":"Gemini Man","review":"When I read THE GEMINI MAN I couldn't believe it was a 1st novel. Steinberg is an amazing talent. Couldn't put the book down. He's a lean, mean, writing machine. Hope there are many more books to come. Wow!"},{"Title":"Gemini Man","review":"Steinberg has crafted a crackerjack good read. The theme has gravitas, and the plot features nifty twists that keep the pages turning. I particularly liked Steinberg's layered characterization of Newman as harbinger of a new breed of amoral man. The action is swift and has the gritty feel of authenticity. I suspect Steinberg has walked, in one form or another, some of the scenes he creates. The resulting muscular narrative gives us a book brimming with a power and honesty missing from many other works in the genre. Steinberg's no kidder, and he doesn't josh anyone with this, a superb first novel."},{"Title":"Gemini Man","review":"More of the same old &quot;commando secretly recruited by US gov. ultra-secret nasty covert ops unit blah, blah, blah&quot; It seems that the X-Files has influenced the creation of this mutant genre which mixes dubious high tech, quasi science fiction and a little horror.

The play that goes on between Patricia and Brian (the main character - who's as compelling and dark as Hanibal Lechter) is done very well.My favorite line from the book...&quot;Nod for yes, die for no.&quot; A perfectly twisted line.There are some really good characters here as well as a nicely driven plot.It's a good ride and well worth the read."},{"Title":"Gemini Man","review":"This was definitely not a book that you can look forward to reading.

Grant it Brian Newman was a complex character.Brian Newman could have escaped a little earlyer in the book.If Brian Newman escaped earlyer he could have played some major games with his captors.Especially Patrica Newlly. Also I think Brian Newman should have had an ecounter with Newlly. Newman this animal but yet able to be soft and dominate the so incontrole Newlly deep down inside that character thats what she wanted A man who could take her like a man and be damned raw animal passion thats what Newlly wanted and thats what Newlly needed."},{"Title":"Gemini Man","review":"I was expecting a Thomas Harris type villian, i.e. Hannibal Lecter; what Steinberg gave me was the big spider from &quot;IT&quot;. What a let-down. I wouldn't say the book was a complete waste of time, but the action was predictable and the characters were cardboard cutouts. I kept reading on, waiting for Newman to develop into something but it just bogged down into some psycho-babble about man's evolution into something crueler, yet Newman showed the most emotion of anyone. The ending was particularly disappointing. .The literary equivilent of a made-for-TV movie."},{"Title":"Gemini Man","review":"The central plot of &quot;The Gemini Man&quot; can be summed up like this: a U.S. covert operative (i.e., a spy/saboteur) with an IQ of 186 and no apparent moral conscience to speak of has just spent six and a half years in a horrible Russian prison. He had been caught after sabotaging a Russian nuclear power plant, causing it to explode and killing thousands of people. Now he is being released to the United States. But the U.S. wants to see if he belongs in society, so it puts in (involuntarily) into a psychiatric ward in Europe, where he is observed by a group of psychologists. He, of course, wants out; after all, he escaped twice from the Russian prison before being recaptured.You might expect that with this set-up, the novel would be a slam-bang action thriller about his escape and revenge against those he perceives as having wronged him. And yet, that isn't really the direction that Richard Steinberg seemed interested in writing about. Instead, much of the novel covers a sort of a psychological chess match between the operative (Newman) and his captors/observers.Along the way, the psychologists tasked with figuring Newman out come up with different theories to explain his seemingly lack of moral empathy, a condition generally described as sociopathic -- which doesn't apply to him because he doesn't have sociopathic tendencies. One psychologist in particular believes that Newman is the next evolutionary step -- a human who is able to act and think without the hinderance of morality, excessive emotionalism, and so on. A sort of Mr. Spock. Or, as you can see from the name, a &quot;New man.&quot;Curiously, Newman is not a particularly interesting character, although the psychologists are. One reason for this is that Steinberg writes in a third person omniscient narration, so that the reader is privy to the thoughts of the characters, but he hides much more of Newman's thoughts from us than those of other characters. Thus, we get less of a sense of what Newman is thinking, and hence understand him less.The psychological aspect of this novel reminded me somewhat of Philip Kerr's excellent &quot;A Philosophical Investigation,&quot; while the evolutionary debate was reminiscent of Frank Robinson's &quot;Waiting.&quot;"},{"Title":"Gemini Man","review":"This book is not one of those lame &quot;scary&quot; books that only have gore and no story. In fact, this book is the opposite. This book is scary because the thought of the evolution of a person with no feelings is not only likely, is near inevitable! This book, although it has some psychological business lingo, it's not hard to understand. A great book!"},{"Title":"Gemini Man","review":"In reading the synopsis of this book, you get the sense that it may be all psychological. You couldn't be more wrong. The author blends the action in masterfully. The book steadily builds speed to a rocket finish, with a nice little twist at the end. The psychobabble lingo is present but it's nice to not have to deal with a book of this type miring itself in technology and weapons discussion. The characters develop well and carry the story themselves."},{"Title":"Gemini Man","review":"Good read. Fairly well paced, great premise, sympathetic characters. Bogs down on some of the psycho-babble but enjoyable"},{"Title":"Gemini Man","review":"A US secret agent (one of their best) gets caught after blowing up a Russian nuclear plant, thus killing thousands of innocent people. The Russians place him in their prison for six years and then release him back to US. This agent simply lacks any emotion and US wonders if he can fit into their or any society, so they place him in a European psychiatric institution, where he is observed and tested. He escapes and all hell breaks loose. Excellent debut novel from Steinberg, very psychological. Great ending."},{"Title":"Gemini Man","review":"Having just read a set of biological thrillers, I came into this novel with a different perspective from the other reviewers. I was expecting more of a discussion of the science, and less focus on the events and actions.From my perspective, it was a thoroughly enjoyable novel, because it did some different things from a standard novel.It was scientific enough to stand as a novel in that genre, yet there was enough action to make it a thriller in its own right - a bit of a dull one, admittedly. Having read about another of the author's works on the back cover, I discovered I should have been reading it as a action novel, not a scientific one. That I could make that mistake all through the novel should say something about the quality of thought that went into it.It would have been all to easy to write a story of how Newman escaped and ran amuck until he was tracked down by a team of brilliant forensic psychologists (something like _Red Dragon_). The author chose to write another story, and in doing so, made it more interesting.The thing that interested me the most was the sliding viewpoint. We are introduced to what appear to be the central characters in the beginning of the novel, yet when all is said and done, some of the central characters are repudiated.This alone makes the book a step away from the formula, and as such, fairly interesting.Walking halfway between scientific thriller and action, yet with some thought and a lack of formula, this book is worth picking up and reading. Not just because it will make you wonder if our government would really do something like that (they probably would), but because it will make you wonder why more authors can't break away from formula to write novels that are this original - in certain senses."},{"Title":"Gemini Man","review":"This is a great book! Combining elements of Harlan Ellison, Thomas Harris, Stephan King, all with a fresh and original, thrilling style. Steinberg creates a new and fascinating world where man faces extinction or the possibility of becoming greater. Steinberg compels us to understand the plight of the lonliest man in the world - the first of the next generation of man. Brian Newman is a magnificently drawn, deeply complex hero/anti-hero.

The stories of solders stealing wedding bands and gold teeth fillings are very painful. I thought we were the good guys. I was always taught the stealing was the work of the Nazis and Russians. I found the book well researched and documented. The book is put together in a good order and is easy to follow. If you are interested in World War Two then this is an interesting and very disappointing view of the American solder."},{"Title":"The Spoils of World War II: The American Military's Role in the Stealing of Europe's Treasures","review":"This book should be read in conjunction with with its sequel, \\"Allied Looting in World War II\\" (McFarland, 2011). Taken together, the two volumes provide the most comprehensive and thoroughly researched account that I have yet found of the plundering, by US Army troops, of countless works of art,coins, objets d'art, etc., in Upper Austria, the Salzburg-Hallein area, and Southern Germany immediately after the end of WWII. \\"Spoils\\" is organized both by episodes \\"The Hungarian Booty\\", The Looting of the Hesse Crown Jewels\\") and by the stories of significant individuals (Norman T. Byrne--one of the most egregious and brazen thieves--and Evelyn Tucker, one of the M&FAA;'s top investigators). The chapter notes in \\"The Spoils\\" are not as detailed as those in the later volume, but by reading the two together one gets a deep appreciation for the throughness of Mr. Alford's research.There is also one other significant difference between the two books: the author's attitude towards the looters he describes in \\"The Spoils\\" (published in 1994) is noticeably harsher and more uniformly condemnatory than the more relaxed (though still disapproving) tone he takes toward similar perpetrators in the sequel, published 17 years later. In the intervening years, Alford seems to have mellowed a bit towards these men and their accomplices, some of them women. In \\"The Spoils\\" the chapters end with Alford passing sentence on men who, it is abundantly clear, he thinks got away with major crimes, just because it was Army policy to look the other way if the relics or works of art could be returned or, failing that, at least accounted for. In \\"Allied Looting\\" he takes a different approach, frequently supplying a page or two of biographical information about the careers these same looters forged--some of them quite exemplary--once they returned to the States and became \\"civilianized\\" (the Army's own term for the decommissioning process). Alford points out--though it is not his major emphasis--that once the American troops left the extraordinary atmosphere of swashbuckling, get-it-while-you-can greed and flamboyant, even predatory sensuality that prevailed in these specific patches of former Nazi-controlled territory and re-entered civilain life, many of them became solid citizens who not infrequently contributed much to building the thriving, intellectually rich, democratically run United States that their generation created over the next thirty to forty years."},{"Title":"Kid's Knit Novelty Cardigans: With Duplicate Stitch Detail, Sizes 2 to 10, 5 Designs (Leisure Arts Leaflet #2301)","review":"I LOVE this booklet.

The protagonist is Tracy Cavanaugh, a recent law school graduate who clerks for a justice of the Oregon Supreme Court.During her last days at the Oregon Supreme Court, one of Tracy's clerk colleagues is murdered. That murder is followed shortly by the murder of the justice who employed the murdered clerk. The murdered justice's estranged wife, herself a brilliant prosecutor, soon becomes the prime suspect. At the same time, Tracy's year of clerking is up, and she goes to work for renowned defense attorney Matthew Reynolds, who is defending the accused wife.This is definitely a better novel than &quot;Undertaker's Widow&quot;, which was the first Phillip Margolin mystery I read. Most of the primary characters are well-drawn and memorable. The plot is unpredictable but doesn't stretch credulity. The last 75 pages give the plot several twists before the ultimate solution is revealed. The book is captivating and well-written throughout.This book provides one more example of the foolishness... several years ago, to change the rating system from a 10-star maximum to a 5-star maximum. This book is a cut above Hazel Holt's &quot;Mrs. Malory, Detective in Residence&quot;, to which I gave 4 stars. It is also a definite cut below Elizabeth George's novels, all of which deserve 5 stars. I will stick with my contention that only real literature deserves 5 stars, and this isn't real literature. But it's about as good as genre mysteries ever get."},{"Title":"After Dark","review":"Now, don't get me wrong - this book has more good things going for it than bad, but the whole thing just seems a bit off to me. There is a lack of focus, for one thing. Whose story is it? Tracy's? Abigail's? Matthews? Charlie's? I also figured it out about 1/3 of the way through the book but I was written well enough that I gladly stuck it out to see if I was right. (I was, but my theory about the motive was a tad bit off). This is not Margolin's best work ('The Burning Man' gets that honor) but it is a good enough read for a long holiday weekend."},{"Title":"After Dark","review":"After being completely blown away by 'Gone, But Not Forgotten' I knew I had found an author who had an amazing gift for intense storytelling...and although not quite as intense as 'GBNF' 'After Dark' has all the markings of an incredible whodunnit. I have to admit, by the time I figured it out (and that was only after Margolin let me in on it) I was totally surprised at the ending. That doesn't happen much these days, but 'After Dark' did it for me (my wife didn't seem surprised, but I sure was) and certainly deserves a lot more than to be just another run-of- the-mill legal thriller. Grisham on his best day hasn't written as good as this. From the opening pages where you get to know the characters, you end up feeling for them, developing small but very realistic bonds that make their problems more like YOURS. Just a fantastic read, and very much worth your time."},{"Title":"After Dark","review":"\\"After Dark\\" is about Tracy Cavanough finding her best friend dead and then Justice Robert Griffen being killed with a car bomb. Are the two killings related? Abbie Griffen, wife of Robert is charged with the murder of her husband. Tracy has just been hired by Matthew Reynolds, the best defence attorney there is. Together they set out to prove Abbie is not guilty. But, is she? Has she snowed Matthew Reynolds? You think it is all figured out then, Bang, you are off again with a new twist. It was hard for me to rate, I nearly gave it a three, but is a little better than that, I guess. I got lost during the first several pages because so many names were thrown at me. I also thought the description of some things went into to much detail. Such as what makes up a piece of metal, or how a picture can me made one time and looks like another time. All in all it was fair."},{"Title":"After Dark","review":"I'm not a big fan of legal thrillers, but I liked this book. Although not as good as his other book, Wild Justice, this one was a page-turner, and only a few pages throughout the courtroom testimony were boring.

The reader can feel like a fly on the wall, watching the amazing events unfold, one by one, shocking as the reader turns the page. With his mastery in this subject, he can write with such enthusiasm and wisdom on the subjects. Margolin is able to expose the many injustices that can be seen throughout his story, allowing the reader to become emotionally attached to the characters. Tracy, in her infinite wisdom captures the audience as the hero, that finds the right path for every one involved. Reader beware, Matthew's a 'genius' to put it mildly, don't be drawn to close to his immaculate facade."},{"Title":"After Dark","review":"This is my 3rd book by Mr. Margolin and all three are awesome!

Thanks"},{"Title":"After Dark","review":"I'm so surprised by the poor reviews... I think the book was great! It had my attention and I was unable to put it down... I was up until dawn one morning reading it because I couldn't wait to finish. It wasn't Gone but not forgotten, but it was a very intense book. You should also read the Undertaker's Widow, another great one! Don't be fooled by bad reviews, if you like mystery and can handle the intensity, read these books! He beats John Grisham and Richard North Patterson by a long shot... and I love their stuff!"},{"Title":"After Dark","review":"If the reader becomes absorbed in the portrayal of this novel's characters, he or she will certainly be prepared for the revelations in the later chapters. Otherwise, this is a fascinating and well plotted mystery. One reviewer seemed quite disturbed by not being able to decide whose story this is. It certainly isn't necessary that a story belong to just one character. L. A. CONFIDENTIAL for instance tells several stories without a true central character. So it is with this novel. It tells the inter-related stories of several characters and doesn't suffer at all for doing so. This is one of those books deserving a thoughtful reading although it does flow very smoothly, enhanced by some technical detail on metals and photography along with a strong legal background. Most highly recommended for crime and suspense readers, but also rewarding to those of more literary tastes."},{"Title":"After Dark","review":"Afer Dark, by Phillip Margolin, is the best mystery/thriller I've ever read (and believe me I've read many). To me the evaluation of how good a book is can be determined in how long it takes one to read it. I read After Dark in less than two days. It is a masterful work of penmanship with a twisted plot that keeps you reading to see whodunit, but the plot is so intricately woven, you never can decide what the resolution will turn out to be. Publishers Weekly called Margolin's style \\"whiplash plotting\\", which is an excellent description. This was a complicated story with a great deal of legalese that could only be done through Margolin's background as an attorney. If you are a mystery/thriller buff like me, then read this book. I think it was wonderful."},{"Title":"After Dark","review":"I listened to the unabridged book on tape of this book everywhere I went for the last few days. It had great courtroom tension, changing suspects and lots of suspense. This was a good thing because more than once the dialouge was so stilted and cliche that I found myself wincing.This is fundamentally a book about lawyers (for better or for worse). Every key character is either a lawyer or has a life that is entwined with the legal system. It isn't always a pretty picture. Almost all of the characters come off as some sort of obsessive personality. Interesting, yes; sympathetic, not really.Still, you keep wondering who killed the supreme court law clerk and, then a month later, the Oregon Supreme Court justice. Are the killings related? There are more than a few great theories and line between the obvious and the sublime is very sketchy.Bottom line: an entertaining read that will tickle your thinking process without challenging it too hard."},{"Title":"After Dark","review":"... I just don't understand all these glowing reviews. Very pedestrian writing. Stilted dialog. Two-dimensional characters.

This was not."},{"Title":"After Dark","review":"This was my fourth Phillip Margolin book and he seems to not disappoint me anywhere over the course of his four books. I have loved everyone of his.

The next day they are found missing and later found murdered. The cops have two suspects, two poor brothers, who are jealous of the couple because they are rich. It is up to the defense attorney and the cops to find the truth. Later the two brothers are acquitted. Did the Court release two innocent men or two guilty murderers?

It was then just a matter of figuring out how Margolin would decide the killer would be revealed. The characters were very flat, the dialogue inane, and the thought that Matt and Abbie would ever be on the verge of marriage is unbelievable. I guess the moral of the story is &quot;You can't always get what you want&quot; (and I don't want anymore by this author)."},{"Title":"After Dark","review":"though obstensibly about capital punishment, this cleverly plotted novel really focuses on two psychologically damaged characters. workmanlike,uninspired prose."},{"Title":"After Dark","review":"Very unusual book.

She's wealthy, attractive, highly respected and, except for her obnoxious ex-husband, Robert, is enjoying a great life. But Abbie's world begins to unravel when a psychopathic murderer she helped put on death row is now free due to her ex who is a Supreme Court Justice. When Abbie is arrested for Robert's murder, she hires famous defense attorney, Matthew Reynolds. Reynolds' assistant, Tracy Cavanaugh, however, worries that her boss is becoming too enchanted with Abbie. Compounding Tracy's problem is the sudden death of a good friend and colleague who'd been having an affair with Robert. As the story intensifies the question becomes how far will people go to establish innocence or guilt?After Dark is a gripping legal thriller filled with legal wrangling, hidden agendas, power-tripping, and ethical issues. In this book, most of the main characters are neither truly good or evil, but the degree to which each one crosses the line into those grey areas is what makes the story intriguing. The behind-the-scenes strategies of prosecutors and defense attorneys was also interesting, although some of the court testimony and research scenes were too long.

With the advent of the Internet and other forms of immediate communications so much information and perspectives are available. Unfortunately, new forms of knowledge replace old forms quite rapidly, and it's getting harder to find out which particular theory or idea is \\"truth\\" and which isn't. Therefore, as knowledge complexity and knowledge obsolescence rises, it's becoming increasingly difficult for human beings to understand the world we live in and solve the concoction of problems we face. But, there are bits of knowledge out there that seldom go out of date and stand the test of time; and it's sitting right here on my bookshelf, the Encyclopedia of Political Economy. To me, the Encyclopedia of Political Economy (EPE for short) is the best source of reference for political economy to date. It has been an invaluable authoritative reference source in my later undergraduate and postgraduate college studies of political economy. The EPE is an important landmark in scholarly development in political economy. My preference is the paperback edition as it is easy to flip through and has an attractive colorful front cover!The EPE is an easy to use 2 volume set which is suitable as an introduction for concerned students and activists whom are interested in the social and political effects of economic policy. You should find the entries uncomplicated to understand, and after reading several of them you'll get use to the consistent format and feel that each one has. Any political economic issue you want to gain knowledge on is readily accessible. Various links on closely associated topics and further suggested readings are provided for all entries. For instance, throughout the text in the entry \\"environmental and ecological political economy: major contemporary themes\\", there are virtual hyperlinks to other areas of special interest: e.g. entropy; sustainable development; natural capital; or Ecological Economics. Plus, at the end of each section, related topics are provided to further direct the reader onto related areas of interest. For example, under the \\"gross domestic product and net social welfare\\" entry, some of the related topics such as \\"household production and national income\\" and \\"quality of life\\" have their own entry in the EPE. With over 450 essays on most aspects of political economy written by experts in the field, you would be sure to find what you are looking for.In summary, we are faced with a large amount of choice in the information we accept as true. In the process we are forced to limit our choices of knowledge and select only the most relevant to what we value and believe. One of those things I value is a greater social welfare for all living creatures; the EPE contributors embrace this too. I personally give the EPE 5-stars. But you don't have to take my good word for it; here are some extracts from several reviews of the EPE, including one from the very prestigious Economic Journal.* Journal of Economic Issues (vol 37, no 4, December 2003, pp. 1186-1188): \\"The publication of this encyclopedia underscores the extent to which political economy has come of age. ... This encyclopedia compares very favorably to the New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics (1987). ... When compared with The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics ..., this encyclopedia has more depth and a greater appreciation of the range of topics relevant to economics. ... This is an excellent reference source, well suited for the non-specialist seeking to understand political economy. It should be available in all university libraries and departments of economics or political economy\\" (Mayo Toruno, California State University - San Bernadino).* Economic Journal (vol 110, no 467, November 2000, pp. F765-766): \\"These [issues] collectively constitute the life-blood of contemporary economic concerns and it is extremely useful to find within a single book a discussion of the major points that define these issues. ... [W]here the Encyclopedia of Political Economy comes into its own is in an institutionally richer treatment of topics ... To the growing number of persons who are interested in the broader context of economics, these volumes are to be highly recommended\\" (p. F767, vol 110, no 467, Nov 2000).* Journal of Australian Political Economy, (no 43, 2000, pp. 148-149): \\"This handsome two-volume encyclopedia is an impressive stocktaking of the main concerns of political economy ... Certainly, the publication of this encyclopedia is a major landmark in the long march to develop an influential alternative to orthodox neoclassical economics\\" (no 43, 2000).* History of Economics Review (no 37, Winter 2003, pp. 159-162): \\"It is a tribute to [O'Hara's] energy that the work was initially planned and organised by him ... There are indeed a number of useful and interesting articles. ... [T]his is a useful collection which will feature on the reading lists of many political economy courses and, hopefully as well, on the shelves of many research libraries in universities around the world\\" (Peter Groenewegan, University of Sydney, Australia).* New Political Economy (vol 7, no 2, 2002, pp. 299-307 \\"Review Article\\"): \\"[This] encyclopedia tells an interesting story about [its] purported discipline's past, its current status and, more ambitiously, its future trajectory. ... The result is a well-demarcated intellectual legacy for political economy to draw upon in its efforts to reclaim a disciplinary mantle. ... [T]ese volumes provide ... the A-Z of our discipline, nicely condensed and sitting right there on our shelf. This is quite an achievement\\" (Randall D. Germain, University of Wales, UK)* The European Journal of the History of Economic Thought (vol 7, no 3, 2000): \\"The Encyclopedia ... is ...a forum for innovative work. [M]ost of the essays ... seem to be thoughtfully and richly informed. [P]articularly the entries on money, credit and finance are worth reading. There are undoubtedly important points being made in these essays. Even the specialist in monetary theory will benefit from reading various portions\\" (Thomas Huth, Fachhochschulke Luneburg, Germany).* Eastern Economic Journal (vol 29, no 4, Fall 2003, pp. 629-630): \\"All entries are organised in the same way. There is thus much formal unity and ... impressive editorial work has been done to this end. The entries are well written. ... I find this encyclopedia definitely original and interesting. It is also stimulating\\" (Michel De Vroey, Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium)."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Political Economy: 2-volume set","review":"This encyclopedia is for true believers in the Post Keynesian tradition of Joan Robinson,G L S Shackle and Paul Davidson.Unfortunately, this approach to economics can't operationalize any of the analytic tools and concepts Keynes developed in the A Treatise on Probability in 1921(TP)or in the General Theory in 1936(GT).An obvious place to start is the failure of Post Keynesians to operationalize Keynes's concepts of the weight of the evidence in the TP,uncertainty in the GT and probability in both the TP and GT.Keynesian probability is fundamentally of an interval nature.It is quantitative and at the same time noncomparative,nonrankable,and incommensurable if any of the interval estimates overlap.The source of this analysis is chapters 15,17,20,and 22 of the TP.Weight of the evidence,w,is an index that measures the completeness of the relevant,potential,available evidence upon which probability estimates will be based.Keynes defined it as 0&lt;=w&lt;=1.If w=0,then you are dealing with what Keynes called ignorance in the TP.A w=0 would also hold in the 1937 Quarterly Journal of Economics article if\\"We simply do not know!\\"Other names would be complete or total uncertainty or the fundamental uncertainty of the Shackles and the Davidsons.w's between 0 and 1 represent cases of partial knowledge and partial ignorance.Here a set of different probability distributions or a set of intervals would have to be constructed.A w=1 allows a decision maker to specify a single unique probability distribution or interval.Given a strict application of the central limit theorem and the law of large numbers,suppose that the data passed the Lexis Q-test for stability.Keynes would then agree that one could apply a normal probability distribution since an analysis of the data would support such a conclusion as long as the data was homogeneous in its composition throughout the series or sequence.Now let us turn to the GT.Keynes was quite clear that uncertainty is a function of the weight of the evidence.As the weight of the evidence increases,uncertainty decreases.As the weight of the evidence decreases,uncertainty increases.u=f(w).If w=0,then uncertainty is total and no estimates of probability are possible.In this case,the decision maker would exhibit a very high liquidity preference and tend to rely on heuristics,rules of thumb,habits,memory,conventions or a follow the crowd approach."},{"Title":"Dinner against the clock","review":"even with a personal library of hundreds of great cook-books, this is one I look to first for ideasand what to buy for dinner.

(The fragrance packaged with the book is not only symbolic but heavenly smelling. It is completely natural -- olive oil from Israel, scented with Frankincense and Myrrh.) As women, we are often wounded in relationships with our earthly fathers or other males in our lives, which ultimately affects the way we interact with men and the way we view ourselves. This book was written from the viewpoint of a heavely Father -- one who sees our inherent value, our dreams, our aspirations, our fears. The book portraits the lives of five women from the Old and New Testaments. There is young Mary, the teen-age mother of Jesus. Eve, the mother of mankind; Rahab, a common prostitute; Anna, an elderly prayer warrior; and Elizabeth, a middle-aged pregnant woman. As they lived our their lives before God, they became a sweet fragrance unto Him, enduring lies, ridicule, hardships and danger.Taken directly from Holy Scripture, the stories bring to light the hard decisions, the obedience, and ultimate faithfulness of God in their lives. Each section features a letter written directly to the reader -- words of encouragement, words to illustrate God's love for His daughters; and words to motivate women to consider the fragrant destiny that awaits them.Packaged in a unique and beautiful four-color gift box, the product includes a book, and frankincense and myrrh fragrant oil from Israel, bottled in fine French crystal. It is a wonderful gift. The oil is symbolic of how a woman's life can become a sweet fragrance unto God. It is a reminder of the beauty of our Creator.The frankincense and myrrh contained in the bottle are based in a special virgin olive oil, pressed on a kibbutz from the Souri (soo-ree) variety grown in the Galilee region of Israel. The essences of frankincense and myrrh come from Oman in the Middle East. Thousands of years ago, perhaps three millenniums before Christ, frankincense and myrrh were two of the most sought after and valuable essential oils in the world. Known for their sacred and healing properties, these essential oils were considered more valuable than gold in many cultures, including Egyptian, Greek and Roman. In the Hebrew culture, oils were used for special anointing (meaning to &quot;rub with oil&quot;) to designate a new king, or consecrate a person to God for a special mission or healing.In later times, frankincense and myrrh became associated with the birth of Jesus Christ when the wise men from the East delivered three gifts to Him -- two of which were these extracts. Biblical references to frankincense and myrrh, as well as to the &quot;carrier&quot; of the fragrances (olive oil) are numerous and symbolic. Frankincense represented sweet aroma, prayers and fragrance in scripture, while myrrh was symbolic of suffering, bitterness and fragrance in scripture. Olive trees symbolized &quot;the anointing&quot; and spiritual life in Israel and the church.A small portion of hte oil also comes from olive trees scattered on the Mount of Olives. Jesus and His disciples walked and prayed in this historic place where the Garden of Gethsemane is also located. The word, &quot;Gethsemane&quot; means &quot;oil press.&quot; When we, like the olives are &quot;pressed&quot; or &quot;crushed&quot; we can be used for a greater purpose in God's kingdom.Many women today feel crushed with responsibilities and circumstances of life. It may be their work, children, or personal relationships. Perhaps they live with an addict husband or are a single parent trying to sustain. Maybe they are experiencing financial instability or out-of-control habits. Whatever their burden, God sees their crushing. This book is meant to draw women closer to a loving Father, one who knows their pain and can see beyond their circumstances to the fragrance of destiny that awaits them."},{"Title":"Daughters of God: Ideal gift for any woman on that special occasion","review":"&quot;You may have never seen yourself as the fragrant rose, the delicate orchid that completes God's work of love.

It lifted my spirit to read of the special place women hold in the LORD's heart. The book includes the testimonies of women who were woven into the fabric of humanity, what they must have felt and thought, how they overcame and fulfilled their destinies in God's grand design. These are women I can identify with and call &quot;sister&quot;. Included in this gift set is, not only the treasure of this book that will last a lifetime, but also a bottle of fragrant oil scented with frankincense and myrrh (very precious and sacred throughout history) ... packaged in a beautiful gift box.

One of the best thing is that in the countries that have a long history the history is divided into sections. As in the history of Rome which is divided into Rome before the Republic, Republican Rome, the Early Roman Empire, and The Later Roman Empire. This makes these long histories easier to understand and to compare time references with histories of other countries. The book has good maps of each country and interesting illustrations.Anyone interested in the new material that is being put forward regarding the ancient world needs to have this book for reference. Although it's copyright date is 1980 much of the information is relavant and needed in order to reach decisions pertaining to the new material being presented. The new material is very exciting but one needs to be careful about accepting it at face value. This book can help keep one part of your mind on the ground while the other part soars into the great beyond."},{"Title":"Aztec Thought & Culture","review":"This book is not horribly difficult to read, providing a line by line commentary on Nahuatl philosophy-poetry. However, if you're looking for an easy to read, general overview of the philosophy, I do not recommend Aztec Thought and Culture. It simply gets too detailed too fast."},{"Title":"Aztec Thought & Culture","review":"This book should be among the first books to read if anyone is trying to learn the true Anahuaca (Mexican and \\"Central American\\") history. Portilla does a good job in mentioning important theological aspects of our people, in that what Europeans interpreted as \\"Gods\\" are actually manifestations of one creator."},{"Title":"Aztec Thought & Culture","review":"This tour into the thicket of Aztec thought is indispensable, which is why I gave it four stars. But it was written forty years ago, leaving it with two glaring problems.The author: What might seem to be hyper-political-correctness is actually poignantly outrageous ancestor worship. The Aztecs can do no wrong, so get used to it. On p. 155 Leon-Portilla takes us through the \\"sagacity\\" of book burning! \\"The common folk were worshipping pictures of their ancient rulers as gods.\\" (Sound familiar?) How, exactly, was this culture-destroying move sagacious? Well, it shows that the Mexica had \\"a strong awareness of history\\"!(But when the Spanish burn books, poetry, art and music - beauty itself - leave the planet forever.)This quaint attitude actually helps make a difficult topic entertaining. The translation is a more aggravating problem. \\"Deities of the Close Vicinity\\"? Why didn't our translator throw in some English, like \\"Lords of the Nearby\\"? And he gives us \\"tiger\\" in place of jaguar! (Spanish for jaguar is \\"tigre.\\")Leon-Portilla goes to great lengths to explain a phenomenon common in N&aacute;hautl, difrasismo, which apparently is rare in Spanish. But the translation completely ignores that it's the bread and butter of English - difrasismo is the coupling of words, like \\"bread and butter\\"! The crucial Aztec phrase \\"face and heart,\\" for example, is apparently untranslatable into Spanish, but English has \\"body and soul,\\" or the plural \\"hearts and minds\\"! How beautifully Nahuatl must translate directly into English!This is a must-read for the student of ancient America, and not just because there's nothing else out there. But oh for a new translation!"},{"Title":"Aztec Thought & Culture","review":"I recommend this book to be read among the first if anyone is trying to learn the true Anahuaca (Mexican and \\"Central American\\") history. The most important part in my opinion of this book is the theological aspects which Portilla explains, in which he at one point says that what Europeans interpreted as \\"Gods\\" are actually manifestations of one creator, Ometeotl."},{"Title":"Aztec Thought & Culture","review":"I first bought this book thirty years ago. I now use it as a text book for my Mexican American Culture and Society Class and for my Pre Hispanic life and Religion Class.

It provides great insight into the Aztecs thought, culture and language. I am also reading one of the authors other books, titled &quot;Fifteen poets of the Aztec world&quot; which I also recommend. These books are great for anyone who is interested in the Aztecs."},{"Title":"Aztec Thought & Culture","review":"Just like India's Upanishadic teaching tradition unfolded the Knowledge of the true identity of the individual, the universe and God, the N&aacute;huatl Tlamatinime (spiritual teachers) were the &quot;phylosphers&quot;, as Sahagun called them, who, abiding in Spiritual wisdom, were able to guide their students to discover the nature of their True Self. Don Miguel Leo&oacute;n-Portilla is the ideal commentator because, after introducing his readers to the Tlamatinime's recorded words, showing a deep personal insight of the N&aacute;huatl language, he accurately and methodically expounds, word by word and verse by verse, in the content of their spiritual wisdom. My opinion is that he could be considered the Adi Shankaracharya (the Commentary Master of the Tradional Vedanta texts of India) of the Americas."},{"Title":"Aztec Thought & Culture","review":"Leon-Portilla successfully demonstrates that there was a class of professional intellectuals in Nahua society appropriately described as \\"philosophers\\" (the tlamatinime), and sketches in broad terms the parameters of their thought.I felt, however, that this book is in effect only half of the book that should have been written, because of the way Leon-Portilla undervalues Nahua theology. His monotheizing reduction of the Nahua pantheon means that he removes the content of Nahua thought and leaves only the form, if that. It does not seem to occur to him that theological structures can provide the basis for philosophical reflection; instead, he assumes that philosophy and theology must be in opposition. This is clearly a projection of philosophy's situation in the Christian and Muslim world, but Leon-Portilla offers no evidence that a similar tension existed in Nahua society. This inability to question his own presuppositions is a serious defect in an otherwise bold, important book which does make a real contribution to the project of expanding the boundaries of philosophy beyond the European tradition. I'm rating it slightly higher than I otherwise might, because the effort to do this sort of thing is not made often enough."},{"Title":"Aztec Thought & Culture","review":"These Aztec poems and narratives reveal deep questions about the nature of humans and the universe itself."},{"Title":"Aztec Thought & Culture","review":"This book is largely a commentary on early Spanish writers in 'New Spain' and mainly for Sahagun. The book starts out by talking about the Aztec/Nahau philosophers the 'tlamatinime'. In fact it keeps repeating verse/poetry from the first section of the book throughout when referring to these wise men. It got to the point reading this that Sahagun and others works were included so much that I felt I should be readingFlorentine Codex: General History of the Things of New Spain (Book 6, Rhetoric and Moral Philosophy)first hand (if it wasn't so unreasonably expensive, an affordable reprint is due).This book does make a cursory reference to the perennial philosophy in inferring the Nahau culture was part of it. A claim which is somewhat speculative but probably correct. When one visits Teotihuacan, a primary Nahau/Toltec site, there is no doubt the complex was not built by savages. Probably because we have a Mexican and not a Spanish writer the Nahau are conveyed as a deep people extremely civilized and not a rapacious savages as was sold to the world by the conquistidors.Recent linguist research as presented inAztec Calendar Handbookmakes a strong case that Nahautl originated in the Four Corners region of the US Southwest. Specifically there are linked to Chaco Canyon and it's complex of temples. It is a tenable hypothesis that the tlamatinime and Nahautl culture originated here and migrated down to Teotihuacan and their cultural/linguistic descendants finally to Tenochtitlan prior to the invasion of Cortez.So I'd rate this as a respectable work from mainstream academia but not as a full depiction of Aztec thought and culture. That prize goes to Laurette Sejourne whos classicBurning Waterhas not been equaled in the study of things Aztec/Toltec/Nahuatl. While Portilla's book takes you to the edge of the regions cosmology Sejourne brings you backstage. When Portilla winks and mentions perennial philosophy it's Sejourne who convincingly and indisputably delivers the goods. Portilla's book may be required reading for an Mexican religion 101 class. But Sejourne's work is beyond Phd material. Sejournes work is more like being let into the secret mysticism yoga of the Nahuatl. In fact there are few books that see into mans true role and interaction with 'reality' as 'Burning Water.'

His works are all impeccably well researched and easy to read, useful on a recreational and scholarly level. It is also worth noting that, as a work originally written in Spanish, this English Language Translation has been handled skillfully and with great success.If you're interested in learning more about the Aztecs, and the Nahua in general, than any school outside of Mexico itself will teach you than read this book, and follow it up with &#34;Broken Spears&#34; and :15 Poets of the Aztec World&#34; by the same author."},{"Title":"Aztec Thought & Culture","review":"I don't think this book was a &quot;waste of time&quot; in fact this depicts true Mexica historical, cultural and linguistic facts and interesting details the way they are meant to be told.

The contrast of thelives of &quot;upper&quot; and &quot;lower&quot; class white southerners put anall too real spin on the views of society. Some of theseviews are still in place today. The family of Armstrong Toddshowed us that a united family can achieve.

Campbell also effectively defines the essential economic causes underlying racial strife, and how the upper class has effectively employed racism to secure its own position.Scanning the reviews from around the nation, however, I also expected this to be great literature. While it tells an important and noble tale, the characters, plot, and metaphors are far from extraordinary. This is a very readable, interesting, and informative work, but any profundity is limited to what is depicted, not the literary prowess of the writer.A decided weakness is the book's attempt to cover too much territory, and a regrettable \\"peaceable kingdom/cumbayah\\" conclusion where justice is on the horizon, and the evil get their just rewards. Unfortunately life usually isn't that tidy, and evil often goes unpunished.Readable, and a tale quite familiar to those who have studied the civil rights era -- I would particularly recommend it to those wishing to learn how civil society and the status of black Americans have been transformed since the fifties."},{"Title":"Your Blues Ain't Like Mine","review":"Throughout the book there is alot of talk about ethnicity, plantation owners, slaves, and even racial slurs. However, I did not think of the book so much as a racial novel, but more like as a way of expressing how everyone undergoes some type of difficulty or problem in their life. Although it seems like no matter how hard you try to what you have to or need to so to overcome trying times, more just keeps piling on. The title &quot;Your Blues Ain't Like Mine&quot;, seemed to be a way of differentiating each characters scenario. No one thought the other had it worse. It was like they were comparing how their lifestyles had changed after Floyd killed Armstrong. However, none of these people really had it that bad, with the exception of Floyd of course. They each rose above their problems. Obviously this was no overnight task, but they did make it. Which is the same with us. We always make it through the hard times, even though it seems beyond our reach. Bebe Moore Campbell did an excellent job of composing this novel. It is obvious that she had her audience in mind. This is prominent in the way she is able to keep the interest of the reader. With each page the anticipation grows fonder. You stay in constant wonder as to what is next to come.

READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Your Blues Ain't Like Mine","review":"This book is clearly based on the tragic story of Emmett Till, the young boy brutally killed for whistling at a white woman in the 1950s. However, it takes on a life and depth of its own, and is remarkable for its sensitive portrayal of how racism destroys both victim and perpetrator.One of the most compelling aspects of Campbell's narrative is that she does show compassion and a deep understanding for the lives of poor southern whites. She tries to penetrate their consciousness without excusing their acts of violence. This leads to a greater understanding of why such atrocities could take place. The villains are mostly motivated by fear-fear of being seen as weak, for instance. It would be easier to not see them as human, but healing and prevention of future tragedies can only come from greater understanding.Campbell's insights and skills as a storyteller make this a wonderful read, and her retelling of one of the most horrendous miscarriages of justice in the civil rights period (Emmett Till's murderers never did jail time) make this a book no one should miss."},{"Title":"Your Blues Ain't Like Mine","review":"\\"Your Blues Ain't Like Mine\\" is an ambitious novel. It begins with the murder of an African-American teenager in rural Mississippi in the 1950's. It then follows the boy's family, the family of the murderers, and other citizens of that small Mississippi town, for the next 40 years or so. Many of the Blacks in the story move north to Chicago during this period. So the story describes not only the social and political changes in the deep South during those years, but also the experience of those who exchanged the seething racism of Mississippi for the northern big-city ghettos.In choosing to portray such a vast - and critically important - period of American history, the author set herself a daunting task. There is a tremendous amount of material to cover in a novel like this. And the job can't be done thoroughly in 460 paperback pages. The author often condenses a major change in a character's lifestyle or philosophy into a single paragraph or even a single sentence.The characters are well chosen and sympathetic (except the characters who weren't intended to be sympathetic), and the book is well written and well plotted. But for myself, I found myself wanting much more than Ms. Campbell was giving me. I suppose that a 1200-page novel wouldn't have sold nearly as well as this shorter one. But a 1200-page novel, on the same subject and by the same author, might have been a historically great achievement."},{"Title":"Your Blues Ain't Like Mine","review":"There is nothing HAPPY in this book at all. But it's well written, and the story draws you in from the beginning and holds you until the end. I had to stop after every couple of chapters and kind of regroup emotionally because it was so intense."},{"Title":"Your Blues Ain't Like Mine","review":"This is the first book by Bebe Moore Campbell I have ever read and I fully intend to read the others. I felt that she had a very deep connection with all of her characters, regardlesss of color. I have read some black others that wrote with an obvious bias, and with this book I felt none of that. I also thought she did an excellent job of portraying the woman's role in a marriage and in society. I noticed that in with both the black and the white characters the woman were going through very similar trials. It was very interesting that when it came to an issue of social class as the years went on that the citizens of Hopewell became divided by how much money they had and no longer by the color of their skin. It just shows that money still transcends everyhting else to determine one's role in the social pyramid. Overall I would recommend this book to anyone, it gives a true understanding of the process of desegregation and the mindset people were living in."},{"Title":"Your Blues Ain't Like Mine","review":"I became familiar with Bebe Moore Campbell's work only after reading &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot; because like Esther, I did identify with the challenges of being black and female on the job. In &quot;Your Blues Ain't Like Mine&quot;, she shows the horror of how one misunderstanding can affect the lives of the people of a small town. Floyd is more interested in proving his manhood to his father and brother than protecting his wife's reputation. Delotha is wracked with guilt and shame for not keeping her son Armstrong the victim, and Armstrong's father Wydell realizes that his inability to be a father has to do with his own inability to come to terms with the horrible relationship that had with his father. Lily, the unintentional instigator of this whole affair realizes that as she grows older, life is harder, men aren't always going to be there when you need them and that things aren't as rosy for other people as they seem especially when she discovers how bad off her in-laws have become, but at least in the book the characters try to come to terms with the past and struggle to live in the present.I would recommend this book to anyone who would want to read it."},{"Title":"Your Blues Ain't Like Mine","review":"Campbell's novel is one that is to be commended. I thoroughly enjoyed the story and her writing style. Sticking to detail but not adding too much is just what any reader appreciates and she comes through time and time again. Campbell wrote a book that contains so many characters and covers the span of nearly four decades and not once did she lose my attention or respect for her genious. Lovers of Toni Morrisson and Maya Angelou will certainly want to give Bebe Moore Campbell a try."},{"Title":"Your Blues Ain't Like Mine","review":"The sign of a great book is that so consumes you that you dare not put the book down, and can genrate a wealth of emotions, from despair to hope, to joy. This novel is a case in point. It's been years since I picked this up, but even now I can remember and recall this novel most vivid parts. Racism and a sense of justice are two of the themes covered in this novel, and I am surprised this hasn't been adapted into a motion picture. Lastly I had the pleasure of meeting Mrs Moore Campbell not long after this was releashed, for a book reading of this novel, and was fortunate to get a sense of what she wanted to achieve with this novel, as well as a signed copy.

I have to admit in the begining of the book, I found it a little boring. But as I continued reading, the novel got better. It sets back to from the 50s to the late 80's. It talks about character's races. Also how the murder of a young black boy changed society. It changed people's mind of the community. This book is excellent, I have no negative feedback. It is a MUST READ ANd BUY the Book! WOnderfUl Content. I did pay 14 bucks for the book! But the money was worth my Expense!"},{"Title":"Your Blues Ain't Like Mine","review":"I found this story to very interesting and attention grabbing. I did not read the book, but listened to it on tape which made it even more intriging because they told the story from two perspectives ( a white voice and a black voice). This story told life from various aspects such as the life of blacks in the rural south, those of blacks in up north, and those of whites in the south. It showed different time frames and what time can do to an environment and the changes that are made as far as race and sexism. It potrayed African Americans as whites viewed them in the 1950's which is inferior. As time moved on, instead of blacks working for whites, they worked with whites and voiced their minds more as the story progressed into more modern days."},{"Title":"Your Blues Ain't Like Mine","review":"taking from the life of emmitt till, she weaves a great story similar in nature, tugs at your heart and makes you angry all at once"},{"Title":"Your Blues Ain't Like Mine","review":"As with all of the books I've purchased by this writer, this book was superbly written.

The tool of realism. Thank you to the author that captured my imagination from the very first page. This is truly one of my favorite books and I am a lover and avid reader of Black Fiction"},{"Title":"Your Blues Ain't Like Mine","review":"What I liked about this novel is that Ms. Campbell compares the two families and see how they fared. In reality, they both suffered the effects of that one act.And it kept on until it ultimately destroyed the Coxes. They never really recovered from that, and it showed. Now about Delotha, she pinned all her hopes on her second son, and forgot the other two daughters she had before him and paid a price for that as well. But I felt that they did more better than the Cox. It is sad, but it really didn't pay for that boy to die. Up to this day, on that Till case, some said he said something to the lady,some said he did something else, if you ask me, he died in vain. Why?? What was the point????? In my opinion, you can never do something in this world, and not pay the price one way or the other and in this book, that is what happened."},{"Title":"Your Blues Ain't Like Mine","review":"She tells a story of two families in Mississippi, one black and one white.

I put the book down a few times in the beginning because I just couldn't get through it. Not because it was bad but because it was so sad and reading about racism in the past saddens me. Once I finished the book and thought of how she tied this story together I could not help but to say &quot;this must really be a skilled sistah to write something so touching&quot;. I have never, ever read a book the told such a story so damn well. I was touched. I actually cried at many times in the book. SHE IS A GREAT WRITER blessed with a skill for story telling.

Keep up the good work, Girlfriend."},{"Title":"Your Blues Ain't Like Mine","review":"This book may have been written as a fictional piece of literature, but it has more than one rather vivid portayal of the crimes committed in the south and how they manifested their way to rule a black society. The way that this book relates to factual events, such as the case of Emmitt Till, it is shocking that these things truly occured. Also, how those events effected generations of people. In this book the reader can truly see that with the different people of the book, not one of their songs of blues is like another. Ms. Campbell ... A+ job!"},{"Title":"Your Blues Ain't Like Mine","review":"The Coxs of Ms. Campbell's story are still very much a part of the American society and this book brought their mentality very close to me.

This situation resulted in a violent death. All three men beat Todd to death. This incident changed the state of Mississippi forever. It was really sad at first but it made me realize that racism actally exist more in the Deep South than anywhere. Not only does it exist but a change has to be made to resolve this problem which is not getting any better but getting a whole lot worse. I'm not saying that racism is only in the south, its everywhere,and it needs to be stopped."},{"Title":"Your Blues Ain't Like Mine","review":"Before I got half way through the book, I was wondering whywasn't a movie ever made of this one.

The fear, anger,deception, guilt, and emptiness that these characters experienced. I can feel some of their pain and sorrow. One can only smell the fish, feel the heat, endure the anger and helplessness felt by the characters. I try to write short stories but cannot float my words in the sea of passion that Ms. Campbell has been blessed to able to do. I give her 5 gold stars for this book. I have already purchased the Sweet Summer and Brothers and Sisters... I don't know which one to begin first.

This book will stay in your thoughts forever, as it should.~Kaili"},{"Title":"Your Blues Ain't Like Mine","review":"I am an avid reader, and this is one of the best books I've ever read! It was so visual that I felt as though I was standing right next the the characters. I applaud Ms. Campbell for creating such well-rounded characters. What Floyd did was despictable, but he still comes off as a human being struggling to find his place in the world. No one is all good or purely evil, and I'm glad that Ms. Campbell communicated that. This story is really about class. I thought it was interesting that the poor whites and blacks fought each other, while the rich whites sat back and worked to control everyone's life. I thought the ending was very hopeful, becuase it looked as though Corrine and Ida had &quot;seen the light&quot; and had decided that working together to fight corporate greed was better than hating each other. I do agree that this novel should be made into a film. This is one tale that should be on the big screen. Let the world know that black people have more depth than what we have seen in the latest novels turned movies."},{"Title":"Your Blues Ain't Like Mine","review":"I give this book such a high mark because of the message that it will bring a generation who does not know about the Emmett Till murder. The Emmett Till murder is the single most heinous crime that has ever been inflicted by one man upon another. Were Ms. Campbell a little more faithful to the truth, the brutality would have kept some readers from finishing this narrative. I hope many people will look further into the true story that &quot;Your Blues&quot; depicts in a far more gentle account. There are several books about the Till murder available her at amazon that are worth the time. Ms. Campbell is a good storyteller and uses the simple language that is designed to appeal to a large audience--- and she is successful in her endeavor."},{"Title":"Your Blues Ain't Like Mine","review":"I read Bebe Moore Campbell's novel about two years ago and I have not found a book that comes close to paralleling it ever since. Cambell's rich, vivid book is as alive for me today as it was when I read it two years ago. Do not pay heed to the Kirkus Review; the latter part of the book does not play out like a soap opera. Rather, the book explores the humanistic side of the aftermath of Todd's death; a side many of us are not exposed to when similar racist killings of Blacks occur (i.e. the Emmett Till case). Todd's killing falls like the first domino in a long, curving, winding road of many other dominoes, affecting the Black and White residents alike in its wake, threatening, like a breaking dam, to flood all of them, for many generations to come. When reading the book two years ago, I lived with the characters, breathed the same air they breathed, and, in some cases, felt the same emotions they felt. Befitting to its title, the book plays out like a live blues performance, with each character taking the mike and releasing all of the despair trapped in their barely beating hearts. The language is rhythmic and engulfed my very being with every word. The characters' world became my world and Campbell did not release me from this world for one second, this world that breathed from every emotion known to humankind, from love to hate. Step into this world and you will be forever moved."},{"Title":"Your Blues Ain't Like Mine","review":"What a read! In her book, YOUR BLUES AIN'T LIKE MINE, Bebe Moore Campbell serves up thirty years of our national history as it was lived and endured by the residents of Hopewell, Mississippi. The characters are fictional, but the author has imbued them with a sense of suffering and vitality that is as deliciously real as the smell of fried chicken and tamales wafting from Ida Long's kitchen window.Even though this story begins almost a century after Lincoln &quot;freed&quot; the slaves in the South by signing the Emancipation Proclamation, it is still a tale of slavery and of peoples' struggles to be free. Not all of the &quot;slaves&quot; in this novel are poor, and not all of them are African-American. Indeed, the author uses this intricately detailed tapestry to show that slavery is what happens when a person quits fighting for freedom and acquiesces to the dominance of others.This is one not easily forgotten!"},{"Title":"Your Blues Ain't Like Mine","review":"Dear Mrs. Bebe Moore-Campbell; After reading a portion of your YOUR BLUES AIN'T LIKE MINE while waiting for my friend to finish dressing some time ago, I had promise myself to buy and finish reading it one day. But as is many promises, I soon forgot it. Then one day recently I happen to be listening to my favorite talk radio station and heard Mrs. Bebe Moore-Cambell talking about the same book, she was here in Chicago on a book signing tour. I called in spoke to her briefly, and promise to rush right down and purchase a signed copy from her. Not only was she a delightful person, in person, the sister is very heavy upstairs (smile).As for her book, YOUR BLUES AIN'T LIKE MINE, Once started, I couldn't put it down until I had finish it. Me, being in my 60s,, 66 to be exact, had experience many of the happening she wrote of in her book. The only part I found her lacking in, were her mentioning of the Korean war. But then I had served there as a combat infantryman; and wrote of my experiences there in WHAT'S A COMMIE EVER DONE TO BLACK PEOPLE? In it I detailed the psychological effect the war had on me, a then 17-year-old kid fighting in a racist United States army. A war where we black soldiers soon realized the bitter irony of our situation--supposedly fighting to protect the rights and freedom of an ethnic people, many of us had never heard of before; even as that freedom was denied us in our own country. My experience was a rude awakening to the realities, not only of life and death, but of politics. Writing this book was one of the most difficult decision of my life. But perhaps it'll serve as an inspiration to other Black-veterans, to tell their stories, our history; and encourage talented writers/educators such as Mrs., Bebe Moore Campbell, to continue with her very enlightening and POWERFUL portrayer of a REALITY of life that we African Americans have experience. I am sorry I can only give her FIVE-STARS."},{"Title":"Your Blues Ain't Like Mine","review":"Your Blues Ain't Like Mine is a well developed book.

Ms. Campbell did an incredible job of portraying the racial conflicts in this time and place. Definitely a book with adult content, I would highly recommend it to those who are trying to understand the origins of racial tensions in the South. Kudos to Ms. Campbell for an heroic epic. My only criticism is that the last quarter of the book is hurried up as she brings the characters forward to face the changes that came as a result of integration."},{"Title":"Your Blues Ain't Like Mine","review":"This book truly takes you on a journey into the hearts of thewell developed characters. Based on the true story ofEmmett Till, Bebe Campbell Moore carefully portrays the reality of livingin the south during the Civil Rights era. My only critique of the book isthat Bebe seemed to be overly ambitious in covering over forty years ofhistory."},{"Title":"Your Blues Ain't Like Mine","review":"first of all,I enjoy THE WRITING STYLE OF BEBE CAMPBELL MOORE.I liked this particular book because it was surprising how much the author could get you to see the similarites and the contrasts in the different races and genders in the book, you feel their pain, their anguish, their happiness and their sadness regardless of their race but you also get a ending that is true redemption and without melodramatism. It is a story not so much of the South and the aftereffects of racial tensions but the story of how different people's \\"blues\\" are TO THEM. And how despite all the lies, prejudices and stereotypes that try to paint people as strange and different. We are really all alike except that some people have a bigger heart and wider sense of forgiveness than others. Despite that, or maybe even because of it, many people struggle to understand how, when that 1 person whom that meet that does not fit stereotype, just does not fit, what exactly is wrong and thus, for me the power of this book. Some of the very prejudices and problems (\\"blues\\") many cultures have to undergo are solely due to ignorance of what makes us all so very alike, we all bleed red blood, all women give birth with the same body parts, we all fall in love, laugh, cry etc, because we are all human"},{"Title":"Your Blues Ain't Like Mine","review":"I read this book so long ago but it has stayed number one in my best books of all time.RIP Mrs. Campbell you will always be missed and remembered fondly."},{"Title":"Your Blues Ain't Like Mine","review":"I read ALOT of books. This book enticed me to read it over again after about 8 years. I had remembered it being exceptional but because so many years had passed it was like reading anew. I've read all, or almost all of Bebe's books. This first one is, by far, the best one. Bebe Moore Campbell is a helluva talented writer. She gives excellent descriptions of her characters which are many in this book. However, she develops them well so that the reader is able to keep straight who is who and his relationship to someone else. She wrote some analogies that made me laugh out loud, i.e They (White people) when angry \\"start looking like beets.\\" But overall, the book deals with issues of pervasive racism and it's wide reaching effect of destroying the perpetraters as well as the victims. I could say so much about this book, but the bottom line is that it is well worth reading. According to the many 4-5 star reviews it's unanimous. Get it and start reading."},{"Title":"Your Blues Ain't Like Mine","review":"This is one powerful book! It is a sweeping, epic look at the US after integration, written by a master of dialogue, with a genius for storytelling. Campbell conveys, through brilliantly conceived and expertly-written chapters, the lives of a generation of people, taken from the various \\"classes\\" in plantation Mississippi. So many works of this type are three times longer, and are filled with things that can be tedious -- not this one!! This is a book which is impossible to put down, impossible not to care deeply about each one of the characters, and impossible NOT to understand the scope of the issues she presents. Campbell never preaches, never talks down, and unapologetically presents her characters as deeply human, complex, and sometimes flawed.Campbell's characters spring to life, and each one interacts with the others in a way that is unforgettable. The story imbeds itself like a virus, and it's impossible to shake. This is not a shallow story, it's a work in consciousness raising. It's offered in a way that only Campbell has the right to offer, and it serves to each one of us an opportunity to both see ourselves and see the solution, and have hope for the future. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Your Blues Ain't Like Mine","review":"This was honestly the first book that made me feel so connected to the characters that I cried. It was a beautifully written, emotional story. Such a great read. One of my all time favorites. This was BeBe's best written book."},{"Title":"Your Blues Ain't Like Mine","review":"Although \\"Your Blues Ain't Like Mine\\" is not a story to pick your spirits up, it is most definitely a worthwhile read. Bebe Moore Campbell knew human nature, which in itself is a reason you'll be satisfied with the work, her first. Her perception of character is pleasing. She deals with the dregs people experience, as well as the joys. She really gets into people's psychological problems, the blues, whether the one enduring them is black or white. Most excellent. She died too soon, within this past year. I will have to read her other works as well."},{"Title":"Ernest Hemingway's for Whom the Bell Tolls (Barron's Book Notes)","review":"For me, this is the best of Hemingway's novels. It combines all the things he could do best as a writer and sustains them throughout an epic story. The basic subject matter is that of much of his work - courage and fear and their consequences, the world of the senses as felt through the enjoyment of food, drink, sexual love and the natural world. As a man, he experienced these things first-hand, and as an artist he rendered them truly. The book's hero is Robert Jordan, an American, who leaves his relatively safe life in the States to fight against the Fascists in 30s Spain. He posseses the attributes of the essential Hemingway hero - an outward simplicity of manner , a knowledge and acceptance of death combined with a love of life, stoicism and integrity. Hemingway's heroes were presented as heroes; not as John Wayne-type caricatures of &quot;manliness&quot; but as men (and women) faced with the forces of death and doing their best. They become afraid, they sometimes do foolish things, but we are never asked to consider them craven or ignoble. We are shown human weakness but the overall message is that of the strength and nobility of human beings. &quot;A man can be destroyed but not defeated&quot; (or vice-versa) was an expression Hemingway used. He never seeks to make less of the human spirit, as so many modern anti-heroes of literature have done (eg the central character in Dostoevsky's &quot;Notes From Underground&quot;, the disenchanted figure in Celine's &quot;Journey To The End Of The Night&quot; or the cynical, amoral Renton in Irvine Welsh's &quot;Trainspotting&quot;.) The overall effect of &quot;For Whom The Bell Tolls&quot; is of a broad work with several viewpoints. We have the Spanish Civil War as seen by the peasant rebel forces based in forests and caves, the behind-the-scenes look at the military players and politicians and the propaganda machine with its figures such as &quot;La Pasionara&quot; These run simultaneously over the several days of the book's plot, and we see the cause-effect relationship between them. Like some mathematical equation or some structure of taut wires and connections, we are carried along to the plot's climax in which we see how all these threads have run together. This book does it all for me. The characters are just as real as they need to be, the country is beautifully evoked, we are given wonderful descriptions of simple things (the moisture-beaded pitcher of beer in the hotel room after Pablo and Pilar had made love in the hot afternoon) and in the dialogue the way Hemingway has literally translated the Spanish language - the use of &quot;thou&quot; and &quot;thee&quot; and the Spanish expressions that he has avoided rendering into the English equivalent. Hemingway loved Spain - its land,its people and its culture, and this is very evident in the book. He was also a very knowledgeable lover of bulllfighting, boxing and hunting and indeed seemed fascinated with violence and war. This tendency has been used as a stick with which to have a poke at the man, which, in our sanitized, politically-correct times is (sadly) understandable. We may not like the sight of blood and agony, but it is a lot older and more real than the glossy social veneer which tends to coat much of what is modernly offered as art/entertainment/philosophy. When we see death, the fear of death and the triumph of courage, we see some portion of what is still a basic truth in this world. So, maybe those who criticize Hemingway's interest in violence have a point. Bullfighting is certainly no fun for the bull and I'm sure that getting shot in a war has its drawbacks. What I would say to those who condemn the artist along with the man is to consider what kind of work (if any) an artist can produce who stays within the safe harbour of the middle-class, academic world of proffesorships and literary grants. Perhaps Picasso was a nightmare as a husband and perhaps Beethoven had bad breath, but I will opt every time for that which I find true and moving."},{"Title":"Ernest Hemingway's for Whom the Bell Tolls (Barron's Book Notes)","review":"Papa pushed, plowed and pulled everything he had in '39 to pen this work. What he came out with nevertheless was by far his most resonant and enduring work. No other American writer has been more of a romantic, and this clearly manifests all those hidden feeling Papa (the boxer, the hunter, the adventurer) truly had. His ending, the best part of the novel, juxtaposes what he wrote and believed in Farwell To Arms: &quot;If people bring so much courage to this world, the world had to kill them to break them, so of course it kills them. The world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong at the broken places. But those it will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially.&quot; Thus, this work examines the essence of life, that is, What is one doin'? What is one wasting time on this or that for? Papa's best work will live on through because of this romantic, realist style combination. Thank you Papa--you've made me thi! nk more empirically about life, about death, about existence! You weren't lamented enough, alas!"},{"Title":"Ernest Hemingway's for Whom the Bell Tolls (Barron's Book Notes)","review":"The title of this great novel gives me chills everytime I hear it. It perfectly reflects Hemingway's purpose. I love his clear and &quot;true sentences&quot; style, but it doesn't appeal to everyone. Thus, if you read a review of this book that is leaning on the negative side, it may be more a reflection of the reviewer's stylistic preferences rather than specific drawbacks to the setting, characters,or plot of For Whom the Bell Tolls. This may not always be true, of course, but Hemingway is unique and tends to polarize readers.The protagonist/hero of For Whom the Bell Tolls is Robert Jordan, an American who feels passionately enough about The Spanish Civil War to act bravely on behalf of the cause. Robert Jordan doesn't seem to have a national identity at all; another person's life is truly his own--the bell really does toll for him.The understated love affair between Robert and Maria is wildly romantic. The ending is haunting- it took my breath away. Do read this; it's an unforgettable experience."},{"Title":"Ernest Hemingway's for Whom the Bell Tolls (Barron's Book Notes)","review":"I must admit when I started reading this book I was bored, but that quickly changed as I realized how deep and meaningful this book was. I have NEVER read a book that so simply went to the roots of what it is to be human. Sure some parts were a little simplified like the relationship between Jordan and Maria, but even that made a point of how quickly people can come together in a difficult situation. Plus, I have never read a better scene in a book than that of El Sordo's last stand. In my opinion, that is the best part of the whole book and is what merits this book being a classic. There is one paragraph in the section of El Sordo's last stand that moved me as deeply as any work of art or musical piece ever has. It was truly sublime. And that to me is what makes this book great."},{"Title":"Ernest Hemingway's for Whom the Bell Tolls (Barron's Book Notes)","review":"Hemingway is an old pro at describing the unique comradery and personal relationships between men. The reader is reminded of just how fragile the balance between life and death is, and how being entrusted with the safety of others justifies a man's sad fate. However, the triumph of spirit over misery in this work just makes you want to scream, &quot;YES!&quot; Such passion for &quot;living&quot; is lost on too many today. I have rediscovered my awe of humanity amidst the mountains of the Spanish Civil War"},{"Title":"Ernest Hemingway's for Whom the Bell Tolls (Barron's Book Notes)","review":"he writes so simply, talks about war and love on the same page, in the same paragraph. The characters are so real, the lives so fragile. It's so simple and it's so immensely complicated. There is such pain in this book, in this story. It's very beautiful, brutal, wonderful."},{"Title":"Ernest Hemingway's for Whom the Bell Tolls (Barron's Book Notes)","review":"This book was not long winded as some people say it is. If you don't have the patience to appretiate such a masterpiece don't read it. Hemmingway's simple style of writing is very quick and easy to read and yet explains everything is stunning detail. It made me want to learn the Spanish language and see the Spanish countryside. The message that it delivers is simple yet powerful and should be appreciated by all."},{"Title":"Ernest Hemingway's for Whom the Bell Tolls (Barron's Book Notes)","review":"One of the best books I have ever read. Hemmingway mixes in war and love and speaks of the injustice of war and how it brings together and seperates the people that it involves. A classic."},{"Title":"Ernest Hemingway's for Whom the Bell Tolls (Barron's Book Notes)","review":"This novel is not the great masterpiece that everyone claims it is. The story is extremely slow moving and only encompasses three days of time. There is a great deal of repition and excessive detail. There is not sense of urgency or action as you might think a war novel would include. Many episodes, including Pilar's story about the episode in her villiage, Maria's rape, and Sodo's death could be ommited or at least greatly summarized. Although the book is almost five hundred pages long it could be summarized in ten pages. The love affair between Jordon and Maria is overly idealized and is extremely unbelieveable. Maria's bland and submissive personality and their dialouge make me physically sick. It seems appropriate to say that Hemingway had absolutely no idea about women. This book is not worth your precious time."},{"Title":"Getting to Know Your Chinchilla","review":"This is a good simple introduction book about chinchillas and their needs; simple & easy enough for older children & adults. I think it is necessary to follow thru with a more detailed book if a person is considering getting a chinchilla or need to care for a chinchilla, but this book will give you the basics to decide if you want one. I keep my copy near my chinchilla in case I'm not around and someone wants to know a little about my Lullaby."},{"Title":"Great Western Indian Fights (Bison Book)","review":"This book will be your source of great Indian Battles for ever. You will find 25 very important battles from the Great Lakes west to Oregon and south to Mexico. These battles start in 1832 and go to 1891. The authors are recognized as top notch non-fiction writers."},{"Title":"The Japanese","review":"I have read a lot of books on Japanese society and culture and this was one of the most interesting and entertaining. The author lived in Japan for many years, is fluent in Japanese and has operated as an active participant in the Japanese culture. So while gaijin will always be on the outside looking in to some extent, this author got a whole lot closer than most. The tone of the book is informal and occasionally irreverent (laughed out loud on several occasions). The author went more in depth in explaining some issues than I have seen in other works. The previous reviewer's comments are unfounded in my opinion, as the angry tone and the alleged comments about crime and punishment were not in the book (at least the edition I read). The author does make some critical comments about Japanese culture, but overall is very sympathetic and positive toward the Japanese. Perhaps this reflects the fact that the book was written at a time when people were more realistic about cultural differences -- good and bad -- and felt more comfortable candidly talking about them. Overall, this is a very good introduction for beginners, or follow on book for aficianados of Japanese culture."},{"Title":"The Japanese","review":"Jack Seward covers the spectrum of Japanese Life and Thought in his book 'The Japanese: The often Misunderstood, Sometimes Surprising, and Always Fascinating Culture and Lifestyles of Japan. With a jaunty air he covers the need for hot springs and communal baths, matters sexual, crime and punishments and the colourful ways you can leave this world by disembowelment. He also looks at the humor in mis-translation and the Japanese thought on our miscreant Western ways.Its a good read and a must for anybody visiting Japan or a hard core arm chair traveller."},{"Title":"The Japanese","review":"I found Jack Seward's book valuable for the amount of interesting insights it contained, but I think that many of his views and assessments are outdated. In addition, he occasionally gets sidetracked by passionate feelings on certain subjects (America's high crime rate, prejudice against biracial children). These long monologues are extremely angry and at times offensive (Seward claims that crime is an activity engaged in primarily by 'Negroes' and that those who would rehabilitate criminals are 'bleeding hearts'), and I felt that they detracted from the book's credibility. I think Seward's book might have been revolutionary when it was first published, but I didn't find it very helpful in the year 2000."},{"Title":"The Japanese","review":"The delivery was timely and the book condition was very good! The book itself is amazing, Seward is witty and concise in the best tradition of the travelogue. The book is broken into the major facets of Japanese society and each chapter is informative and entertaining to read.."},{"Title":"The Japanese","review":"The author seems to have taken a slip-shod approach to some subjects. Certain areas of the work clearly reveal a lack of research without intellectual curiousity on the part of the author to present a balanced viewpoint. Assertions are made without support or footnotes. Much of the information is dated and does not reflect current conditions in Japanese society. The major crime here is presenting a stereotyped view of a culture which is more complex than the author would have the reader believe."},{"Title":"Travels in San Francisco","review":"Despite the title, this is not really a travel book. It is more a series of slice-of-life anecdotes and reflections from the perspective of a writer immersed in the sidewalk and cafe life of San Francisco. Herbert Gold has a unique, rambling style and I appreciated the flavor he evokes of this city that is his home and which he obviously loves. The book is somewhat dated (1990), at least by the standards of internet culture, but this hardly matters in a book that is largely nostalgic in tone anyway. Gold is one of those people who seems solidly rooted somewhere in between the beatnik and hippie epochs of countercultural America. Since San Francisco in many ways can be considered the capitol of the counterculture, it is his natural home turf. Gold is also the author of Bohemia (the only other book of his I've read), an equally enjoyable work that takes a wider view of the bohemian subculture that has been apparently fading for decades but (thankfully) never quite completely disappears.Travels in San Francisco is basically a series of vignettes --reflections on neighborhoods like North Beach and Richmond, a few short stories that may or may not be fact-based, colorful descriptions of some of the city's many eccentric denizens, tales of some famous cafes, bars and restaurants...This book is certainly not an ordinary tourist guide, and will probably be best appreciated by those who either have some familiarity with San Francisco, or are at least in tune with its unconventional history and atmosphere."},{"Title":"Full Speed Ahead in Reading","review":"This is an excellent practice book for several reading skills from grades 4 - 6. I especially like the short stories because a teacher can easily identify what problems a student may be having concerning main idea, inference, drawing conclusions, and definitions found with context clues. In Texas, we give the TAAS test beginning in third grade. This book has many short exercises dealing with skills found on the TAAS test and gives the teacher a way to pinpoint reading problems.The book also includes worksheets for cause and effect, fact and opinion, and main topics. It is one of my favorite resources for practice in a reading classroom."},{"Title":"Alegres infelices (Spanish Edition)","review":"ALEGRES INFELICES entertaining, and some surprise ending stories, offer us believable characterizations, beautiful narrative style and powerful dialogue use. The book's paradoxical title reveals the nature of the effect on its reader. The author's selection of dark subject matter (death in many forms, prejudice, infatuation) and its use of magical realism, results in captivating mental images that no matter how unexpected and shocking, make you question reality, and in particular humanity. These beautifully written stories simple plots and urban settings are stirred by the complex and sometimes bizarre behaviors of their characters. Some are so intense you might want to reread them immediately. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Born to Succeed: How to Release Your Unlimited Potential","review":"This book helped me to help myself. I was always into positive, self help books, but when this one came along it grabbed my attention from the moment I first picked it up.I read it from cover to cover without picking and choosing &quot;whichever chapter I fancied&quot; as with other books of this kind I have read before. I learned to &quot;listen&quot; to my hunches and got motivated to start my own business totally from scratch. Four years on.. I have now started to franchise my business and taught Colin's principals to my team of staff and franchisees.

He is an internationally acclaimed lecturer, author, and advisor to businesses and individuals. He says that true success is measured by creative accomplishment, rather than material possessions.Turner says the key to success is believing in yourself. He explains how to determine what is is that you really want from life, and why you don't yet have it. He offers practical advice on goal setting and achieving goals. Setting and achieving goals includes investigating why that particular goal is desirable, what obstacles may keep you from achieving it, and the steps you will take to overcome those obstacles. He then shows you how to commit to your goal and reward yourself for each step taken.His success blueprint shows you &quot;how to activate your thought processes--mental muscles--and to draw on your own form of genius.&quot; He adds that we each &quot;have the ability of perform at exceptional levels in at least one area of your life if you can find it.&quot; He teaches you how to find and develop that area. Part of his training is a &quot;30-day mental diet&quot; that emphasizes thinking about your life's purpose and how to best accomplish it.Turner also discusses the importance of spending quiet time with yourself and learning to listen to your intuition.&quot;How tall does a tree grow?&quot; Turner asks, then answers: &quot;As tall as it can.&quot; He advises us to imitate trees, and grow as much as we can. We all have unlimited potential for growth, and it is only our own way of thinking that keeps us pruned into shrubs instead of tall trees. Born to Succeed will help all readers achieve success in life, regardless of how they define that success."},{"Title":"Born to Succeed: How to Release Your Unlimited Potential","review":"I love this book.

Because of the information in this book, I withdrew from the entering class, found a job in a completely different field and today I am happier with my life than I ever could have imagined.

The mega-corps are all very well-detailed, and some of the info has mucho potential as GM material and story hooks. However, I thought that the game info section with the rules could have been a bit better, such as maybe including general pay scale for certain types of shadowruns. But that's just me. Overall, the book rocked. Get it if the Big 10 interest you at all, and especially if you're a GM planning on some corporate espionage!"},{"Title":"Corporate Download (Shadowrun)","review":"Corporate Download is everything that the old Corporate Shadowfiles supplement was not. While CS was a text on how the corps did business and made money, CDL tells GMs and players alike how they operate, what they want, and who they oppose. It also tells PCs how to survive working with the corps, and gives GMs ideas on how to use the corps in their games and create new corps of their own to fill in the cracks in the shadows. This is the good stuff; I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Corporate Download (Shadowrun)","review":"\\"CORPORATE DOWNLOAD focuses on the ten most important characters in the SHADOWRUN universe - the AAA megacorporations that dictate what happens in the shadows and the world at large. The year is 2061, and the dust is settling on a corporate war in which one of the mightiest megacorporations fell. In the aftershocks, three new megacorps rose to prominence, each taking a different path to the top and showing the other megas that they do not have the market cornered on deception and power.\\"- from the IntroductionMeant for use with:SHADOWRUN, 3rd edition and the revised SHADOWRUN COMPANIONRIGGER 2VIRTUAL REALITIES 2.0CRITTERSMAGIC IN THE SHADOWSPlot-wise, CORPORATE DOWNLOAD describes the corporate world as it is after the death of Dunkelzahn (which indirectly triggered the corporate war) and after Deus' takeover of the Renraku Arcology in Seattle, so it is effectively a sequel to PORTFOLIO OF A DRAGON and to RENRAKU ARCOLOGY: SHUTDOWN.Typically of the best of the Shadowrun sourcebooks, this volume is organized as an electronic document from Shadowland, the (fictional) central clearinghouse for shadowrunner information in the Shadowrun world. As in the real world, of course, information is compiled by characters having their own agendas, which may include the spread of disinformation, so gamemasters are free to decide whether the truth is out there and what it is.Captain Chaos begins by turning over center stage to two shadowrunners who in parallel provide two quick and dirty tutorials about the facts of life. The Chromed Accountant in \\"Taking Care of Business\\" outlines the basic knowledge needed to understand the megacorps: the definitions of \\"corporation\\", \\"multinational corporation\\", and \\"megacorporation\\", and what the AAA rating system actually tells you about a megacorporation. Alongside this explanation of what the corps are lies Wobbly's \\"They Got the Whole World in Their Hands\\", which discusses the power of the megacorps: how it evolved and how they maintain it.The next section, before discussion of the individual megacorps begins, covers \\"The Corporate Court\\". The Big 10 megacorps - the 10 biggest multinationals, who between them control more resources than all the other corporations on Earth put together - comprise the Corporate Court, which not only settles inter-corporate disputes but determines a corporation's status in the A - AAA rating system; that is, the Corporate Court decides whether a corporation has extraterritoriality, whether it can act as a law unto itself.After a final bit of initial tutorial material, \\"Surviving the Corporations\\", each individual member of the Big 10 has its own chapter, ranked in alphabetical order. Several entries begin with a little corporate history lesson before moving on to discuss the corporation's internal organization (e.g. primary divisions or businesses) and the major power players, such as Lofwyr's inner circle in the case of Saeder-Krupp.All of the above is marked up with running commentary by Shadowland's shadowrunner visitors, expanding on areas of their own expertise and debunking items they disagree with. Lots of adventure seeds here, though no pre-packaged scenarios; shadowrunners often give examples. The main article on Yamatetsu, for instance, describes their corporate policy of no shadowruns not sanctioned by upper management, to prevent pointy-haired middle managers from messing up situations they don't understand. (The policy came about because a mid-level exec arranged for the murder of a Shiawase employee who'd been making trouble for Yamatetsu - who turned out to be a Yamatetsu deep-cover agent luring Shiawase into trusting him, unbeknownst to the middle-management Yamatetsu weenie who tried to take him out.) In real life, this means that runs arranged for a mid-level exec's personal gain involve dodging Yamatetsu's own security.Very good read.\\"Though AA corps have frequent dealings with the Corporate Court and accounts with the Zurich-Orbital Bank, they have no official presence on the Court proper. Despite their power, they remain as much at the Court's mercy as the smallest corps. Each and every one would kill their mothers to get on the Court.\\"- the Chromed Accountant"},{"Title":"Corporate Download (Shadowrun)","review":"While a lot of the information is in fact from Corporate Shadowfiles, this time around a more 'universal approach' was taken whe reviewing the Big ten.

Depression-era America created a crisis of authenticity and relevance for artists, intellectuals and those in the communications industries. The result, says Stott, was a new form of public art, focused on everyday people and based in fact. Readable and persuasive, Stott's book is as fresh and memorable today as it was when it first came out in the mid-'70s.

In addition to breath practices, this book revitalizes the ancient teachings of the four elements (earth,water, fire, and air) making them useful in helping to understand relationship problems, improving emotional health, and restoring optimism.

First, it makes for a fascinating read - as there is more concrete meditation instruction in this one book than most volumes 10 times it's size. But as a book on meditation must prove itself over a long term. It's not like learning how to build a paper airplane. The Sufi tradition that gathered all of this info itself was a wonderful discovery for me in this book. The specific info and instructions on how to focus on your heartbeat are proving challenging in meditation - but then every technique I have ever tried has proved challenging. This is the reason meditation has always been a guru-based activity. It's ways are subtle, and it can be easier to learn when you can see, sense and feel the vibration of someone tuning into a technique than it is to read about it. So the medium of a book for this topic makes it a challenge and a slow path. But trust me that the information in this book is worth knowing and revisiting many times as you make your way down that path."},{"Title":"Living From the Heart: Heart Rhythm Meditation for Energy, Clarity, Peace, Joy, and Inner Power","review":"I have been a meditator for many years. I am experienced with many different forms of meditation and inner work. I have found Heart Rhythmn Meditation as presented in Living From the Heart to be an extremely effective method for reaching a state of inner peace, harmony and balance. This book explains this simple, powerful and effective method of meditation. The point that I found particularly useful in Bair's method is the distinction that he makes between upward and downward meditation. Upward meditation's purpose is to release one's consciousness from the constraints of earthly existence. Upward meditation can create all sorts of personal, emotional and psychic problems for unwary practitioners. In contrast downward meditation helps one to understand the purpose and meaning behind one's daily life. It is a much safer form of meditation designed to make one better able to deal with real life problems. For For busy modern people it seems that the downward meditation is the more useful technique. I recommend this book to people that would like clear, practical instructions for meditating."},{"Title":"Living From the Heart: Heart Rhythm Meditation for Energy, Clarity, Peace, Joy, and Inner Power","review":"Living from the Heart describes another form of meditation - that is based on the heart. Overall Bair does a fine job at describing how to practice heart beat meditation(HBM), the book is well layed out and gives a step by step sequence. The method is flexible enough that you can adapt it for you own needs. Play with it and take the parts which suit you best. In my case it help me flesh out the Hesychastic Prayer of the Heart as found in the Orthodox Church. You can even go to his web site (do a google search)and download the fundamentals of HBM to try it out before buying the book.However I do have some gripes, the first being that Bair pushes HBM as a psychological panacea and hence comes off as some New Age Tony Robbins with all the testimonials. He also makes curative claims that are not substantiated by any research. Personally I find this a turn off as there are psychological problems that need a psychotherapist not a meditation practice to correct. But thats just me.The other gripe the breathing sequence in HBM involves prolonged breath retention -- a powerful but potentially dangerous yogic practice which is usually taught to yoga students who have practiced for some years. It generally has a energizing effect so if you are excitable or want to relax you may wish to alter the sequence. So please be careful with this aspect.Overall it's a fine addition to any meditators bookshelf. Puran is not overly preachy or other worldly. He's down to earth in his presentation. I don't think you can go wrong with it.Other books worth I believe complement it are:The Knowing Heart by Kabir HelminskiHeart Self and Soul by Robert Frager"},{"Title":"Living From the Heart: Heart Rhythm Meditation for Energy, Clarity, Peace, Joy, and Inner Power","review":"Living from the Heart has altered my perception of what it truly means to be \\"real\\" and has had a profound effect on not only how I perceive others but more importantly on how I react to all of life's situations. I've found that through the breath practices alone my life has changed. My energy is double if not triple what it was, my ability to listen to others and really hear what they are saying has increased when I listen with my heart and maintain a full breathing pattern. Add the element breath practices and WOW you have a guaranteed method of changing your energy to match the situation. If you need to be the calm voice of reason in a business meeting where everyone else is charged up and you use the air and earth breaths you can not only see the bigger picture and commonality of everyone's concerns but you can remain calm in the storm and actually calm down everyone in the meeting (both in person and via phone). If you've had a long day and need to get a boost of energy or optimism then the fire breadth will increase your energy. The water breadth is perfect for developing and sending empathy and emotions for not only your closer relationships but also with those you may have just met. I've found that learning to harness the power of your breath can be an extremely powerful tool in business as well as in life.I have tried many different forms of meditation over the past 24 years and have taken multiple leadership, communication, relationship building and \\"stress relief\\" courses yet they only cover bits and pieces of how to effectively listen to your intuition, relate to another person, show empathy and relieve stress. Living from the heart gives you sound, easy to practice and incredibly powerful methods of developing your concentration, intuition, communication with yourself, and guides you to living a heart centered life.The key to this method of meditation is that it is not just visualization or counting or any of the other methods that take you away from your body and self but rather key practices that will apply to every situation in your life. This book not only teaches you how to meditate but gives you the tools to apply the benefits of mediation to enhance your everyday life. It gives you the tools you need to contact your heart, hear what it says, learn how to breath (which if that is all you learn from this book your life will be greatly enhanced), and to really connect with your spiritual side. The method is based on thousands of years of collective knowledge from multiple religions and spiritual practices blended with the latest in scientific research.Puran Bair has done an absolutely spectacular job of synthesizing the best practices that many spend a lifetime learning and presenting the knowledge in an easy to understand, easy to practice and incredibly powerful manor that anyone can learn and benefit from.I've given copies of this book to countless friends. Anyone that wants to learn how to really breath and utilize the power of the breath, develop awareness of their body and heart, increase their body's natural healing capacity and connect back with (or enhance) their spiritual awareness will love this book regardless of religious affiliation (or lack of religious belief).In addition, those who will benefit are not just those on a spiritual path but anyone that wants to harness the power of their breath...using the square (or diamond) breath is a highly effective way to increase your lung capacity and VO2 Max...useful for runners, atheletes, anyone living in or traveling to high altitudes or basically anyone interested in increasign their stamina, recovering from surgury (takes pressure off your chest), and increases your vitality and health."},{"Title":"Living From the Heart: Heart Rhythm Meditation for Energy, Clarity, Peace, Joy, and Inner Power","review":"This is a great book for both the new and experienced meditator. Exploring the sound of your heart in meditation is a wondefully rich and centering experience. The book guides you step by step to achieving this, as well as advanced methods that will continually allow you to grow. For the new meditator, there is also a program w/ a timetable in the back of the book to help you structure your progress."},{"Title":"Living From the Heart: Heart Rhythm Meditation for Energy, Clarity, Peace, Joy, and Inner Power","review":"I have been a meditator for many years. During this time I have had experience with many different forms of meditation and inner work. I have found Heart Rhythmn Meditation as presented in Living From the Heart to be an extremely effective method for reaching a state of inner peace, harmony and balance. This book explains this simple, powerful and effective method of meditation. It works for both those beginning and those sustaining a meditation practice. The aspect of Bair's method that I found particularly valuable is the distinction that he makes between upward and downward meditation. Upward meditation's purpose is to release one's consciousness from the constraints of earthly existence. Upward meditation can create all sorts of personal, emotional and psychic problems for unwary practitioners. In contrast downward meditation helps one to understand the purpose and meaning behind one's daily life. It is a much safer form of meditation designed to make one better able to deal with real life problems. For those of us that have busy, active lives in the world that are geared towards accomplishment and achievement, downward meditation is the more useful technique. I recommend this book to people that would like clear, practical instructions for meditating."},{"Title":"Living From the Heart: Heart Rhythm Meditation for Energy, Clarity, Peace, Joy, and Inner Power","review":"I was initially attracted to this book because the concept of living a heart-centered life is very appealing to me. I have purchased too many spiritually-oriented books over the years that were not truly useful in daily life, however, so, as I leafed through Puran Bair's book, I was looking for evidence that there was something offered that would be of practical benefit to me. I was immediately struck by the clarity of the writing, the accessible organization of the text, the diversity of practical applications offered, and the grounding of the work in a legitimate, long established universalist spiritual tradition. This book has been useful to me in my personal life, particularly in regard to relationships and in the healing of emotional wounds, and it has also been very helpful in my professional life as an educator and counselor. It is a book that helps facilitate the understanding of self and others; a book that teaches how to build bridges between hearts. Our world needs these practices."},{"Title":"Living From the Heart: Heart Rhythm Meditation for Energy, Clarity, Peace, Joy, and Inner Power","review":"I have read many many \\"heart\\" entitled books over the years and it is surprising to me that so few people are aware of this book and the method of meditation that it introduces, especially given its ease and effectiveness. Before I discovered this work, my own heart had attained various states----from serious questioning with Ramana Maharshi and other spiritual quests, to the ecstatic verse of Rumi and Hafiz----from sharing with patients, life's trauma and joys through years as a health care provider, to the wrenching-heart-breaking-openings of ended relationships.When I began Heart Rhythm Meditation, sensations and awareness felt great right away which aroused my curiosity and encouraged me to keep practicing. But it took me six more months of various methods of this meditation before realizing I was experiencing much more than just a temporary high or an insightful understanding. Some essential aspect of my being was gradually changing by such a simple practice of attending to my breathing and my heart-beat.(For the quickest experiential entry, go immediately to \\"The First Intervention\\" practice on page 144 for a limited number of breaths. Then go right on to page 155 \\"The Second Intervention\\" also for a limited number of breaths. Gently. Simply. Easily. Entering into a \\"conversation\\" with your lungs and then opening to the possibility of a \\"conversation\\" with your heart. If any anxiety or concerns arise in this new relationship with your heart, move right on to page 166.)I have read this book every year for the last nine years and shared it with patients and students. With even a little patience, I know you will discover or uncover within, exactly what the book's subtitle suggests: energy, clarity, peace, joy and inner power. Moving into your heart, layer after layer after layer. Holding a feeling state longer and longer. Living less through your mind, and living more from your heart. You will not lose any mental abilities but calm and enhance them as you gain your full heart function. As Puran Bair speaks so succinctly, you may now live with your mind in service to your heart.(This book provides practical emotional experience of the Elements and insights on pranayama for those interested in either of these arenas.)Puran and Susanna Bair have also published another title:Energize Your Heart"},{"Title":"Living From the Heart: Heart Rhythm Meditation for Energy, Clarity, Peace, Joy, and Inner Power","review":"This book and its author have had a more profound impact on my life than any other book that I have ever read. I practice the meditations which it contains daily, and have become very involved in Heart Rhythm Practice. When a friend told me about this book and how much it had impacted him, I had no idea of how powerful it would be in my life! Because of it and the author, I have made changes in my way of being in the world that I would never have thought possible. \\"Livng from the Heart\\" provides practical tools for managing daily stress and challenges as well as giving a blueprint for accessing a tangible connection to \\"The One Heart.\\" For me, this book is priceless.Jeanie Underwood"},{"Title":"Living From the Heart: Heart Rhythm Meditation for Energy, Clarity, Peace, Joy, and Inner Power","review":"Living from the Heart is a book that can change your life.

What I didn't quite grasp then was I was buying a book about meditation, but also much more. And what I really didn't know was how much this one book would set me on a direction that has been unbelievably rewarding. I still work as a commercial real estate broker, but living from the heart has enabled me to be more focused, more confident, more dedicated to others, a much better broker than I was before, and have a more fulfilling life. This book is a gateway to an incredible discovery process that each of us have a birthright to pursue."},{"Title":"Dream Cards (Lo Scarabeo Decks) (English and Spanish Edition)","review":"The Dream Cards consist of surreal imagery that really do look like they emerged from someone's strange dreamscape. Figures morph in and out of other people and objects and you can never be quite sure of the setting in which the images occur. Some of the card images can be unsettling to some people, but overall, they are fascinating.Prior to using this deck I examined the imagery for several days before I even attempted to do a reading just because it is so highly unusual and thought-provoking.The deck is very useful from an intuitive sense. The accompanying booklet does give thorough explanations as to the cards' meanings (many of which do not correspond with a traditional tarot deck), however, I find the deck more useful if one does not refer to the booklet at all. The images alone help your intuitive side to come up with its own interpretations. As you examine the images it makes your mind look at them as if you're remembering one of your own dreams. We've all done that - had a really weird dream, we wake up and think to ourselves, \\"what the ...?\\" Then we sit there and attempt to figure out what our dream may mean to us. That is how these cards make you think. Sometimes you can't make heads or tails out of the imagery and your intuitive brain kicks into full gear and you find your OWN meaning to the card, then you move on to the next card in your spread.I really enjoy this deck and have been recommending it to my tarot students because it is a valuable tool that will help users connect more fully with their intuition. You don't need the little guidebook that accompanies this deck. Trust your own intuition when you view the images and you'll see just how incredibly accurate your own readings can be for you.I recommend this deck more for those who have used a variety of tarot and oracle decks, but I also believe that beginners can get a lot out of it, as well."},{"Title":"Dream Cards (Lo Scarabeo Decks) (English and Spanish Edition)","review":"I am a tarot reader and when I saw this deck I had to have it. It's beautiful! The images are dreamy and leave a plenty of room for my imagination to kick in."},{"Title":"The Sandstone Rock","review":"I loved this book. It was heartwarming and sad at the same time. Even though Vernon and Susy are a mismatched couple you hope that they find a way to be together. The time is set in the 1950's when intolerance and bigotry were the accepted norm. I like the way that the author gives every character a distinct personality with traits that everyone will recognize in themselves and others."},{"Title":"La juda de Toledo","review":"La Judia de Toledo es una preciosa novela historica que relata la historia de amor entre el Rey de Castilla Alfoso VIII y una judia hija de uno de sus consejeros.

La esposa legitima de Alfonso, Leonor, usa su astucia y su poder para tratar de retenerlo, manipula vidas y reinos como si fuera un juego de ajedrez. El relato de Feuchtwanger hace justicia a la rica influencia musulmana y judia durante los siglos XIV y XV. Las tramas politicas y las pasiones son tan intensas hace cinco siglos como lo son ahora.

An incredible man of faith and science he wrote a pioneering surgical book called &quot;On The Surgery of Pyogenic Infections.&quot; After the communist revolution he was frequently imprisoned and harassed by the communists for his religious belief, but was still admired for his scientific gifts.His life is a testament to excellence in all areas. Even being imprisoned and exiled by the communists, he still served in their military hospitals during wartime because he believed it was his duty to save lives, even those of his enemies.An amazing, inspiring work by Archdeacon Vasiliy Marushchak that is highly readable and inspiring. Saint Luke would inspire the man of faith that doubts science and the scientist that doubts faith. He's even more inspiring to those that believe religion and science can not only coexist, but strengthen each other."},{"Title":"The Blessed Surgeon: The Life of Saint Luke of Simferopol","review":"The Blessed Surgeon: The Life Of Saint Luke, Archbishop Of Simferopol by Archdeacon Vasiliy Marushchak is an impressive biography of a devoutly religious man in the Russian Orthodox faith. Oppressed by the anti-Christian Soviets, exiled and tortured multiple times, Saint Luke retained an abiding faith and openly spoke his mind. He was also a master surgeon, who oversaw the treatment of injured soldiers during World War II, and ironically, received the Stalin award for his pioneer medical work.

Mr. Olsen's meticulous research paints a vivid picture of the characters, which makes the story even more heartbreaking. I also found the insights into the Amish way of life very interesting. This book is a page-turner and very hard to put down. After I finished it, I hoped that Danny Stutzman has peace and is in a better place."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"Eli Stutzman was truly an evil man. A member of a long established Ohio Amish family, Eli appeared to be marking time until he could flee the Amish community. Restless and violent, these traits would resurface with deadly consequences when he set his home on fire, killing his young wife. Fleeing the peaceful Amish community with his infant son Daniel, Stutzman embarks upon a career of murder, gay sex and pornography. He exposes Daniel to the seemier side of adult life; he even encouraged Daniel to participate in adult sexual behavior.Daniel, too, is killed by Stutzman and is dumped in a Nebraska wheatfield. His identity remains a mystery for nearly two years. Articles in newspapers and magazines about the mysterious little boy crop up. Feeling pressured, Stutzman's behavior becomes even more violent and erratic.This book provides a good, sharp look into Amish living and the history of the Amish community. It is well written, well detailed and well worth reading. The real gift is how Stutzman is caught and brought to justice."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"I usually LOVE Gregg Olsen's stuff, but this book REEKS! WAY too many people to keep up with, and trying to follow his story line is like trying to have a meaningful relationship with a MOTH! And worse than that, the graphic detail is just GROSS --- WAY too much information about homosexual sex. I am about halfway through the book and I am ready to just forget about it, but I keep thinking that he will FINALLY get to the point and tell me how this miscreant got the punishment he so RICHLY deserves. The main reason I read true crime is that it restores my faith that the \\"bad guys\\" get their just deserts, unlike O.J. and Cullen Davis, but I digress. Gregg screwed up ROYALLY with this one. Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"The truly startling aspect to the Eli Stutzman story is that justice doesn't appear to have been done & the cases in which he is implicated don't appear to have been resolved. One hopes that one effect of Gregg Olsen's compelling account will be to keep this lack of resolution in someone's mind somewhere in the hopes that justice will be done before Stutzman gets to die a free man.\\"Abandoned Prayers\\" is not for readers who will be offended by description of homosexuality. Homosexuality is part of the Eli Stutzman story & necessary to the narrative in order to explain who Stutzman is & what some of his motivation might have been. It's also clear from Olsen's narrative that Stutzman is an aberration within the gay community.Questions remain about some of the cases touched on in \\"Unanswered Prayers,\\" especially two cases in Colorado, & one hopes that those questions will be resolved.Eli Stutzman and, surprisingly, his son Danny are both well-drawn characters in the book. We don't know Danny intimately, because the author couldn't, because he died so young. But we nevertheless get a wrenching portrait of a stuttering, lost, needy boy denied the chance to reach his potential & denied the chance just to be a child.Whether Stutzman actually physically murdered Danny--& there is some ambiguity about this--isn't really the point, in a way. He murdered Danny's spirit with his appalling parenting & abuse. He is responsible for Danny's death regardless of whether he physically caused it or not. And his punishment for this crime was disgustingly inadequate, a real black eye for the justice system.Among other good, lesser characters are hapless Marine Denny Ruston, hapless Amish teen Sam Miller & hapless Stutzman roomie Glen Pritchett. They stand out as relatively solid people among a sea of names that reads like the wall in a graffited men's restroom stall.In this instance, it's not a problem that many of the lesser characters are little more than a name. That's all they were to Stutzman. It serves to emphasize to the reader the nature of Stutzman's lifestyle & his transitory, passing contact with dozens of hapless men.The reader gets the sense that this is one of the author's favorite cases, much as police often have a particular case that stays with them. One also gets the sense that it could be wide-open to a sequel if justice is ever served.Olsen shows rather than tells the appalling failure of everyone to help Danny. The fact that Olsen understates this point makes it all the more powerful.This is a very good true crime book, well worth the read, packed with detail, compelling & fast-moving. It reads like one of Stutzman's endless road trips, moving right along."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"Firstly, I hate books that don't give me an ending. Mr. Olsen leads us through this book step-by-step -to a fault in some parts- all the way up to the end, only to leave us hanging.It was hard to follow the time line in this book; it jumped back and forth from the father's younger days, to the 'current' time, to sometime in-between and back again from chapter to chapter. Characters were introduced that really had no bearing on what happened, and we would only see them for a few brief pages. Eventually, it got to the point where I could barely keep up with who was who.Thirdly, there was just way to much graphic detail in here. I'm not a prude by any means, but when you're writing a book dealing with a sexually abused child, who was murdered, you might want to avoid describing what sexual toys the murderer had, and what purpose they served. Half the time, it seemed like Mr. Olsen was simply out to titillate us, writing in details that add nothing to the story, in highly inappropriate places, such as describing the older woman's going away party, where the describes the 'toy' they got for her birthday.And lastly, in all of Mr. Olsen's rambling... the one thing he never spends too much time focusing on is Danny himself. Somehow, it just gets lost among the way. The finding of his body, and trying to discover who he is is detailed enough, but anything other than that, this poor kid is just shoved under the bus, for the more important details of sex toys."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"I have to agree with the other readers who gave this one star. It is too long, filled with too much information on gay sex and not I am really sure why he wrote it, it does not answer a lot of the questions I had concerning this case."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"I was unable to finish this book.

The conclusion of the book will leave you speechless--- Mr. Stutzman gets a mere slap on the wrist after committing unspeakable crimes and instilling fear in the hearts and minds of the Amish community he turned his back on. This is a disturbing account of a man whose punishment certainly does not fit the crime.

I was living in Farmington, NM and working as an emergency dispatcher at the time \\"Little Boy Blue\\" was identified and his odyssey from Amish country to death was being tracked. It shocked and saddened me that I may have seen this boy not only because I lived in the area, but because I had young children and was generally out and about with them. It saddened me that not only did this child live and die in our area, but the pajamas he was found in were bought at our local K-Mart (a place I shopped often, mostly for kids toys and school supplies), speculation being that his body was in the back of his father's car at the time the father stopped to buy the pajamas the boy was found in. I was shopping at K-Mart the night and at about the same time Little Boy Blue's father was buying these pajamas. It haunted me that I may have walked by the car containing his body, or that I may have seen his father shopping, or that I may have crossed paths with he and his father many times (the area being very small), or even that I may have known some of the people who considered themselves friends of Eli Stutzman. Coming from a large metropolitan area and then moving to the much smaller Four Corners Area, I, like most people, never thought that such people or such depraved activities happen in small towns. After all, doesn't everyone know everyone else and know everyone else's business in a small town? The story about this unidentified child in the \\"Reader's Digest\\" haunted me for years, and the final answer haunts even more. I enjoyed the book because I am so familiar with all of the places that were mentioned at the time Little Boy Blue was spending the last years and days of his life in our midst. A great read, even better when one can see the places where events happened."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"My expectations of this book were really good based on the number of 4 and 5 star ratings. I was dissappointed and did not find the book nearly as compelling as other true crime stories I have read."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"The story of little Danny Stuztman, known to many as \\"Little Boy Blue of Chester, Nebraska,\\" who was murdered by his father Eli Stutzman is an excellent story; however, as a mother, it was difficult to comprehend how someone can murder their own child.Gregg Olsen does an excellent job of producing the story in easy to read, attention catching detail that never gets tedious and, in spite of the case, is hard to put down. Unlike other true crimes, readers are not subject to tedious text replays from trial transcripts, but everything is laid out in story form.I highly recommend this book to true crime fans...just keep the kleenex handy!"},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"True crime is fascinating -- getting inside the mind of the criminal, discovering what the circumstances were and how the crime was revealed and (hopefully) resolved. Gregg Olsen usually does a decent job of recording these things, but on this one he fell flatter than flat. While the sexual events are important to establishing Danny's surroundings and what his father was absorbed with, the extreme detail and unnecessarily over-used street language (these were not quotes, they were Olsen's own words to describe the sensationalized activities) read like the script from a no-holds barred porn movie. On top of that, the story jumps back and forth in time with no clear reason or path to help keep things straight. Characters reappear after being gone for chapters, making it nearly impossible to remember their original significance (if any); repetition abounds to the point that I thought I'd hit my Kindle's back button. I could skip large chunks of chapters without missing a thing. In the end, I felt that I had learned new things about the Amish and former Amish and how they live their lives; but, other than constant and graphic reinforcement that Danny's father had a predilection for lots of rough sex and drugs, I felt the story of the crimes against Danny was lost in the wreckage of retelling his father's preoccupations."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"Here is the question no one else seems to have asked: why, why didn't anyone turn Eli in? Here is a man who went through more gay lovers than I would have thought existed across the western states.Eli attended orgies with gays and lesbians who actually saw Eli's son, Danny, being taught behavior that I won't even mention because it isn't fit to be read by anyone young. This was clearly, however, abusive behavior. It was clearly morally wrong. It clearly should have been reported. And if only someone had had the courage to report Eli, Danny would likely be alive today.It is depressing enough to read about Danny's teachers, who guess that Danny was being abused, but did not have sufficient evidence to do anything about it. But it is more than depressing, it is horrifying, to realize countless people saw and did nothing.Olsen is a great writer, and in Eli he has an unforgettable character to write about."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"I am an avid reader of true crime and this book was so boring I almost gave up on it MANY times. I ended up skipping pages over and over. There was so much repetition and useless, boring details. It went on and on, with no real point to most of it. Don't waste your time, it's not a good book. I feel sorry for the people involved in this situation and I was sad for Danny, but really most of the book was filler."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"Only in the true crime section of the book store could one find a story so sensational that it involves the Amish, murder, and hyper-sexual behaviors. Yet while true crime stories are often gripping, I found this book to be quite sad. Particularly since many aspects of Eli Stutzman's alleged crimes are still ambiguous, many readers may feel a sense of closure eludes them after reading.Eli Stutzman never seemed to fit with the Amish. Taking a liking to the ways of non-Amish or Englischers while shunning the codes of the Ordnung, Stutzman began breaking from his family shortly after entering adulthood. The suspicious death of his wife made the break easier. But the transition was burdensome as he cared for his child and maintained a gay lifestyle. As Stutzman's lifestyle took him across the country, associates of Stutzman were found dead including his own son. Could Eli Stutzman have murdered his own flesh and blood or is he merely a naive former Amish?Even without the crimes committed, this book is a revealing look at the Amish lifestyle. Frequently the butt of jokes in our modern world, there is certainly a degree of mystery to these people. The book itself does lack a certain sense of closure which may disappoint some readers. Still, it is recommended reading."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"I read this book in 2006 and sometimes still think of the sad story of \\"Little Boy Blue,\\" so named because he was wearing a blue sleeper when his frozen body was found in a ditch. (Note: Keep a box of Kleenex handy for this one!) It took authorities quite some time to definitively link Danny's father, Eli Stutzman, to the crime. However, this is one of those crimes that simply should not have happened. Many, many individuals either witnessed or suspected the severe neglect and abuse suffered by this young boy, yet few intervened. At one time, little Danny was even placed in a foster home where he thrived, only to be returned to his sociopathic father.I found the information about the Amish and Mennonite communities included in this book particularly interesting. And, unlike so many authors who include pages of unnecessary detail about the area or community in which the crime may have occurred (Forgive me, Ann Rule), the information in this book was significant and relevant to the story.Perhaps Eli Stutzman was burdened by his strict, Amish upbringing. Certainly, homosexuality would not have been tolerated. However, none of this explains how incredibly sick and sexually obsessed Eli Stutzman was. His entire life appears to have revolved around meeting his own sexual needs. While no one reports ever suspecteing Eli may have sexually abused his own son, his son was certainly exposed to many unsavory people and terribly neglected. Also noteworthy is that Eli Stutzman presents with a glaring lack of empathy or concern for others throughout his lifetime. He used others for whatever material, physical, or emotional gains he could and then quickly moved on.There may be much about Eli Stutzman's childhood that remains unknown. Perhaps some of that could explain his abnormal development and very sick obsessions. But if that is true, none of that information found its way into this book. While it is rather frightening and disheartening to believe in the \\"Bad Seed\\" theory of personality developement, there do appear to be individuals with very early sociopathic tendencies that, if left unchecked, develop into dangerous, manipulative individuals. Eli Stutzman just may be one of them."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"This book is well researched and so well written I had a hard time putting it down! Although I wanted it to end differently that is not the fault of the author since this is true crime. This book surprised me and that is so hard to do, I have lived among the Mennonites and expected a touristy approach to the lives of the Amish but Gregg did an excellent job of describing where the perp grew up and how he decieved so many. Good job Gregg."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"This is the second Gregg Olsen book I've read. I picked it up because I was familiar with the writer. The story and the excellent writing pulled me in so that I didn't want to put it down. A sad tale, written with compassion and care. A definite MUST READ."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"Greg Olson scores again!I believe in the theory of a &quot;bad seed&quot; (someone who is just born evil) and Eli Stutzman is a textbook case.I've heard Stutzman's been paroled, but how long he will survive with AIDS, who can say? I hope his end is long and painful - it would serve him right for what he did to his own son, Danny and his wife, Ida."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"Way to homosexually graphic for me, I wish I had a warning, I would not have purchased this book. I know more about sex toys than I want to know"},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"I really was interested in this story as I was living in Reynolds, NE when \\"Little Boy Blue\\" was found in that ditch in Chester, NE. Chester is only a short distance from where I lived. I also worked at Foote's Cafe that was connected to Chuck Cleveland's filling station. When Chuck found this little boy, that image haunted him for the time I worked at Foote's and he said it would probably be something he would never forget. My heart went out to him then and after reading this story, it still does. This story is so sad. It is hard for me to understand how so many people stood by and let this little boy suffer just because of their \\"secret.\\" Yes, I realize this was a different time then it is now but was a secret really worth a little boy's life?? I think not. I hope those that stood by and kept silent have to live with the knowledege that they aided in that little boy's death whether they were actually there or not. It is also sad that this man has and probably will get away with murdering 4 people and won't ever pay for his crime. It is hard to believe that something like this happened not ONCE but FOUR times and each time he was never under suspicion or even really questioned. This book was very well written. If you don't shed a few tears you must be pretty hardhearted."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"At first I thought this book was going to be really good, but as it went on and on, with no progress toward a resolution, I just had to give up on it. Olsen went into way, way too much detail about Eli's gay sexlife. I'm no homophobe, but after awhile, I became grossed out by descriptions of 'ball stretchers, cock rings and fisting'. It's like Olsen himself had the obsession. I would have liked to find out if Eli was punished for his crimes, but after reading two thirds of the book, and Olsen still dwelling on Elis lovers and penis size, I realized life is too short to waste any more time on this book."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"I found Greg Olsans book to be very truthfull and interesting. Being familiar with a small county it is amazing how much can go on unseen and how much can be kicked underneath a rug and denied by officials. You never think that a murderer would live next to you but this proves you never know what matter what religion or background you come from."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"Since I have always been fascinated by the Amish and their lifestyle, and I also enjoy true crime stories, I was drawn to this book. Moreover, I remembered the story People magazine did many years ago regarding the young boy, wearing a blue sleeper, whose lifeless body had been found near a corn field in Nebraska in the dead of winter. Abandoned and discarded by the one entrusted with his care, this unknown boy, named \\"Little Boy Blue\\", stirred the hearts of the citizens of Chester, Nebraska, who gave him a formal burial. The heart of the nation was also stirred by the People magazine article, as its citizens wondered aloud as to the identity of this little boy.It would be sometime before that question was answered. \\"Little Boy Blue\\" turned out to be nine year old Danny Stutzman, a young boy whose angelic countenance belied a life of abuse and neglect at the hands of his father, Eli Stutzman, a man who turned his back on his Amish inheritance and left a trail of dead bodies in his wake. After the suspicious death of his Amish wife, Ida, Eli eventually abandoned all that he knew and adopted the lifestyle of the non-Amish. He also came out of the closet, as he was gay, something not tolerated by the Amish.This is a well-researched book, but I was disappointed by it. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I felt that this was definitely not the author's best work, however potentially compelling the story. I found the writing to be sub-par, often choppy. While highly detailed, some of the details came across as needless clutter, as they were not particularly relevant to the state of affairs that was propelling Danny and others to their doom.In addition, there was a certain homophobic ring to the author's prose that was disconcerting and off-putting. There is little doubt that Eli Stutzman was a dysfunctional human being and an abusive parent that exposed his young son to adult behavior that clearly was not in the best interest of the child. He did not, however, act this way towards his son because he was gay. He acted this way because he was a seriously disturbed human being. Unfortunately, from the author's writing one might infer that it was Eli Stutzman's sexual orientation that was at the heart of the murders and Danny's tragic end.Despite the many rave reviews of this book, I found it mediocre fare, at best. Still, fans of the true crime genre might want to give it a whirl."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"I do gobble up true crime books like crazy and this was no different. It was a very quick read. Two problems stopped me from giving it 5 stars.1. There were so many people that came into the life of Eli Stutzman, the main player, that it was very hard to keep the people in order as I was reading.2. The details of Stutzman's sex life were a bit too graphic and didn't really add to the story. I got that he was very active and experimental the first 20 times they were discussed. The second 20 or so were just too much.The story did grab me and I had to finish it ASAP. However, the writing wasn't as solid as Olsen's newer book \\"Deep Dark\\". \\"Abandoned Prayer\\" is a good story, just not a great one. And but don't expect an expose of the Amish community. This is just one guy who is clearly not right in the head. It could have been anyone--who liked multiple sex partners, was a liar, and killed people.Although this guy, Stutzman, served 13 years in jail for killing a roommate, nothing definite has ever been determined about his little boy. Nothing has ever been done about the 3 other deaths discussed in the book.Here is the warning: Don't answer any personal ads for this guy--you will be sorry!"},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"Although I feel that the story is interesting and worth reading it is definitely way too wordy. It takes forever to get through the pointless back story, which is a good third of the book. Unless you are specifically interested in the Amish way of life and their rules I would recommend skipping all of the chapters that don't have anything to do with the murder or back story of the little boy. You will be able to tell which ones to skip by reading the first few sentences of a chapter. It will save you tons of time that I wish I had back without losing the overall story. All of those chapters could be summed up by simply saying \\"Eli, who likes men, is a compulsive liar and is somewhat good at it\\""},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"Being an avid reader, I have read many, many books, both fiction and non-fiction. This is by far one of the most interesting stories I have ever read. I believe someone creative would be hard pressed to make up a story that could even come close to this one. To say Eli Stutzman was an enigma is almost an understatement. I hope to read more books by Gregg Olsen in the future, he weaves an excellent story. Thanks.Holly Ingram"},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"Comments really should be required to post. Rating the product should be sufficient for anyone to make a determination as to whether or not they liked the product."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"I've never read a book from Gregg Olsen before and I was amazed at what a great author he is. This book is a must read if you enjoy these types of books. I'm not disappointed that I bought this book at all"},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"while the author takes us into the unseen world of the Amish culture, his graphic details about Eli Stutzman's homosexual escapades in front of his young son were a bit much for me. Also, I really do not care to know about the size of a killers penis when I am reading a story. How this was relevant to the plot one can only fathom."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"A truly remarkable book. The amount of research Mr. Olsen did is amazing, especially considering the Amish way of &quot;not talking&quot;."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"I could not put this book down. Mr. Olsen obviously did an amazing amount of research and investigation, and the book was extremely well-written. I am a bookseller, and I frequently recommend it to my customers as I am now recommending it to you. The subject matter and villian (Eli Stutzman) are disturbing, but this is a must read."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"It was one of the best books I have read in a long time. The story was set partly in the area I live and there were so many facts that I can remember now from the past in reference to a couple of unsolved murders that it is scary to think all of those horrible things were going on in this rural area. The book tied so many loose ends from many years ago and really brought reality home. There are alot of sick sick people we did not even know existed. Unfortunately, they still exist and we hope Eli Stutzman dies a slow and painful death as he forced Danny to do. The book made us so much more aware of the ongoing and past atrocities committed in this small community. Unfortunately, it also woke us up to the fact just how naive we really are. It is shocking to know that Eli Stutzman is actually out of prison and able to commit his crimes on unknowing new victims."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"A very riveting book with shocking details. I could not put it down. Different worlds exposed."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"This book was so well written, and as a person living near the Amish, I found it truthful of their way of life. Eli was never charged with Ida's death, Danny's death, or the deaths of his &quot;friends&quot;. I pray they reopen the cases, and all the investigators can work together to get the information needed to try Eli for the crimes he most certainly committed. Excellent book, truthful writing, and a caring author."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"As an avid reader of true crime I found his book to be compelling reading, the research that went into was very through, and although I realize that authors do have some poetic license when writing, the style in which it was written did not appear to embellish the facts of the story, and left this reader in no doubt that it was a true and factual account , easily understood and written in plain words,and it had me wanting to finish it to see how this monster was caught. I will endeavor to try and purchase the other books written by Mr Olsen. We had a somewhat similar case here in Brisbane in the 80's, an airman was found guilty of murdering a sixteen month old child and throwing her body on a toilet block roof, then released sometime later on appeal,then this year after two decades modern technology found there was more proof that he had done it ,and this time he was charged with perjury over the murder, found guilty again, but under the 800 hundred year law of double jeopardy, where you can't be charged for the same crime twice, he was released a free man, and today expressly uses the checkout lane at supermarket where the murdered child's mother works,and nobody can do anything about it. Where is the justice? Regards, Jeffrey Walsh"},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"Rather than simply telling the complicated, long tale of Eli Stutzman's life linearly, Mr. Olsen interweaves the tale of the discovery of the finding and identifying of &quot;little boy blue'&quot; a dead child found by the side of a winter mid-west road intertwined with the story of how he got there and the life of the father that left him there. Within this format, he shows us the heart and motives of the all the people involved in this story:the town who adopted the dead boy as their own, the various law officers, and the twisted, ex-Amish father."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"This book was awesome. This is the first time I have ever read one of Gregg Olsen's books. I have always been fascinated with the Amish. There is an amish family near me where the husband killed his wife in front of their 2 children, Crimson Stain is the name of the book I'm referring to - excellent.After reading this book, I now want to read all of Gregg Olsen's books. Have already ordered several.This book kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time I was reading it."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"I thought this book was very detailed in the way the author captured interviews from many people ranging from the people in the amish community, to the string of lovers Eli collected along the way. Your heart goes out to Danny, because he sees and goes through so much sexual abuse from the sole person he trusted, his father. The people that Danny meets along the way-that dealt with his father, see this abuse but keep quiet and go on about their daily life, they will tell you, they didn't want their secret gay life exposed. I truly believe if some of them stepped foward there may be a better chance that Danny would be alive today. He had no one to take up for him, and expose the sexual abuse in his home...I really enjoyed this book because it followed Eli very well."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"I read this book in 1 day! Could not put it down. It is well researched and moves at a great pace. Unfortunately, it does not draw the same kind of emotional reaction as it could have. For some reason, as sad as the story is, the way that the information is presented, I became more interested in making sure that Eli was punished, and at times was not as upset about the little boy as I should have been. Nevertheless, great read!"},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"After reading Abandon Prayers, I found that it was a well researched, well written, compelling, and sad. However, what disturbed me was not the graphic details of homosexual sex (graphic sex and violence is never an issue with me), but the people in this case who knew Eli and saw the abuse that was given to Danny and chose not to do or say anything. It was almost disgusting to read passages where Eli's friends \\"did not want to get involved\\" or \\"it is not my place to say anything.\\" I nearly threw the book out the window when I read how Eli was such a good father (despite the fact that a few witness Eli's abusive behavior towards Danny). I do not know much about parenting since I do not have children, but I refuse to believe teaching a child to seduce grown men or beating on a kid constantly or sexually abusing a child constitute as good parenting. If one person intervened, maybe, just maybe Danny would still be alive.Despite that bit of detail, for those who enjoy true crime or reading about the deprave acts of human nature, this book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"Interesting true crime story with a peek into the lives of the Amish. It begins with lots of background into the father, Eli Stutzmann, his upbringing and lifestyle and then moves on to his life with his son. Unfortunately, about mid way, it got bogged down with so much narrative and detail that I started to lose track of who's who and it became a bit of a tedious read. I persevered because I wanted to know what happened at the end and whether justice was served. A very sad story of an innocent young boy."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"This is the best true crime book ever written. From page one I couldn't put it down. Read it all in one night."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"Yes, it is very graphic, disturbing sometimes, but what is to exprect from a true crime story? Poor Danny did not even have the choice, he was forced to life under these circumstances. The book is interesting, and very well written, sometimes I could not lay it out of my hands. The graphic nature of it remembered me all the time that this person was not supposed to raise the child, who\`s mother he killed in the first place. Eli Stutzman was a mentally disturbed person to begin with, and became a serial killer over time. He is somebody who slipped through the net of law enforcement, and others, innocent people payed the price for it. I pray for his son Danny, his wife, his unborn child and Glen Prichet. May they rest in peace."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"It was a good book but I had a hard time keeping up with all the places Eli moved to and lived with. He had moved so much and lived with so many people that when they would talk about them throughout the story I had to think now who was she/he again and how did they know him? That was probably just me though. The auther couldn't really help that he moved around so much. I would've like to know just a litte bit more at the end though I must say, It kind of left me hanging, never got the \\"Complete story\\" Again that's not really the authors falt I guess."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"Well written account of a true story. Mr. Olsen really did his homework on this one. Maybe if the prosecutors had the info available to them that he collected for this story, Stutzman would have been put away before his (alleged) killing spree began to gather steam. I look forward to reading more of Mr. Olsen's books!"},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"Gregg Olsen's book is interesting to a point, but the author jumps around in laying his case, and it can be hard to follow. He also can get excessively long-winded, and when he does, he gets tedious. Acceptable for true crime, but definitely not up to an \\"Ann Rule\\" standard."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"This books is a stick with you book. It is one of my favorite Olsen books. I feel for poor little Danny and it really gets to me this time of year."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"The book was a little hard to read, it jumped around quite a bit. The overall telling was bland. The worst part was that the main character being gay lent itself to quite a bit of gay-bashing. More notable true-crime writers would not have printed slurs unless it was a direct quote and would have recognized it as a slur. By the end of the book, I found it off-putting enough to write a review."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"Book was better than described, like new. Story was what I expected, well written and researched. Once started reading was hard to put down. Gregg Olsen has described the more or less unsavory aspects of the homosexual lifestyle and the results of it."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"I see that generally this book has received positive reviews here. However, I must say that as someone who enjoys true crime books from time-to-time this one was a disappointment. The writing style was choppy and confusing. There were a lot of details included that I'm not clear were relevant. Danny, the victim, in the story actually gets very little space in the whole text. Instead the Author focuses excessively on the abusers relationships with other men. Some of these relationships were relevant as the abusive father exposed his child to adult behaviour inappropriate for a child. However there is a bit of moral tone here by the author that might lead one to believe that he is not a big fan of gay men in general. The best example I can think of his habit of directly quoting very red-neck statments by some of the officers and others involved.Unfortunately by talking too much about Stutzmans sexual orientation (author mainly uses the word homosexual as opposed to the more modern term gay), he may have blended those old stereotypes that gay men = child abusers. In this case Stutzman was both, but the writing and the presentation leaves a progessive reader wondering.A very sad story, but I think the book could have better."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"Happily ever after does not apply to this story. This story is like a roller coaster. It had some many twist and turns, that you didn't know if you wanted to hang on,or run for your life. Serial killers survive because people don't get involved. This little boys life could have been saved if someone would have spoken up for him. WE never learn if our gut tells something is wrong, it probaly is. What is the worst thing that could happen. There are many reasons the abuser would want to keep the secret.The best reason to get involved you could be the one that saves a life.This story must have been a nightmare to write about. There were so many characters to keep up with and the story line was chilling to the bone. I think Mr.Olsen did an incredible job of keeping up with them through out the whole story.The only cridical statemnt that I have about the book. Is that it had to any details about his sexual incounters. I think the author could have left out or toned down was the sexual stuff. We got that he was a homosexual and that it didn't matter to him. Who , what or where he hooked up with . We get it,that after the first couple of chapters that the man is sexual monster. That he is on the dark side of life, he get his kicks from anyone or anything. It was not necessary to go into details of his sex life over and over. While reading this book the story began tounfolded more an more. I would have to lay the book down,an go clear my head. Eli Stutzman was just as of horrific serial killer as Ted Bundy, and Wayne Gacy. He never received the sentence that he deserved here on earth. I am confident that he will pay for what he did to Ida, Danny and all the other people that he killed. WE proably will never konw the exact number of people who Eli Stutzman killed.I was very happy to learn that Stutzman died 2007. The world can now feel a little safer knowing that this killer will no longer killing by hand, gun or aids. Justice wins another one."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"I love true crime and this book had me focused from beginning to end! You'll learn a lot about the Amish too."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"Any story about a gay Amish serial killer would have to be interesting, and this author has skillfully turned his story into a spellbinding book. I recommend it highly for any fan of true crime."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"While this book seemed to be well researched, it did tend to drag on in places, especially in the last third of the book or so. (I found myself skimming just to get to the end). I do enjoy Gregg Olsens' books, but this one was not one of my favorites. I did feel enormous sympathy for the little boy though, and was horrified by the amount of people who felt they \\"should have told authorities\\" and never did. I also felt a bit confused by all the characters and it seemed a bit disjointed. Overall, a mediocre read but if you like this genre, he is one of the better writers. Also, once again, as in the last Kindle book I bought by Olsen, no photos! Pet peeve. Grrr. I think all true crime books should have at least a few, since it is about real people and not ones we need to imagine."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"This was a horrible book. It took me 5 attempts before finally reading it the entire way through. Olsen did a poor job of keeping &quot;characters&quot; straight, so it was very confusing. There were also so many questions left unanswered at the end of the book that I wished I had never read it to begin with. I'm not sure why I'm the only person to rate this so low, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone else."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"I really like Gregg & he is really good with his fans, I have all of his books, but he just gave too much information in the book. He described some of the things Eli did with his lovers which I really did need to read about. His lovers were not female. And he didn't give information that was needed. And even tho there were pictures in the book there should have been more. Do not buy this book because of me because Gregg is really good & so are all of his other books. If you don't mind reading about what gay men do you will really like this book."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"Sad to say... this story is totally believable (good things since it's a TRUE CRIME story). But it still shocks me that the \\"Englishers\\" are so ready to believe the Amish are incapable of commiting such crimes and that Amish are so ready to look past everything a \\"member\\" does."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"The author, Gregg Olsen delivers with this one! Well written, researched and crafted, Olsen weaves a tale that will pull the reader into a world (thank God) most of us will never see. I don't want to give away any surprises but I will say that in the end I began to wonder if its possible that some people are born without a soul much less a conscience. Go ahead, buy it and read it, I highly recommend it, but be prepared this Amish tale aint about quilts and growing corn."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"This is probably My top pick for the best true crime book of 2004..It is equaled only by Jack Olsens~I~Which I read this year as well..This was a very well written book My True crime book club on yahoo groups all talked alot about this one..I have enjoyed reading Gregg Olsen over the years and he is getting better with each book.

Keep em coming Mr Olsen."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"Being an avid researcher of the Amish, and also living in Lancaster County, PA, my interest in the Amish cultures and traditions have grown immensely. In reading this book, though, it shows that there aren't any cultures in the United States that are void of sick, twisted, & demented individuals. There are always those few people that are just evil in actions and life. It's just so unfortunate that this little boy and his mother were the innocent victims of this horrible individual. The book itself was an excellent read, and I would recommend it to everyone. It's just horrible that there were so many innocent victims and it's unfortunate that Mr. Stutzman was released."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"I was passing through a Book Fair recently and eyed a stack of books devoted to \\"true crime\\". I'd sworn off the genre some time ago due to its unsettling nature but was convinced by a passerby that this one was more a case of bad parentubg than gruesome child abuse. I am not so sure now.We learn a little from every book and in this one it is the world of the Amish, their secrets and way of life. The villian left the the religious community with his son after the suspicious death of his wife. He set out on what can only be called an orgy of casual, gay sex and murder. The authorities are still not sure how many he killed or if he killed his own son (because he knew too much). He was convicted of abandonment then brought up on another murder and convicted. He was suspected in the death of his wife (fire) and son (suffocation or intentional exposure to sub-zero weather) and in 1990 was the chief suspect in the murder of yet yet two more gay men. He seemed to be destroying anyone who could link him to what he perceived as the unpardonable sin.Throughout it all he proclaimed his innocence, got amnesia, found God, quoted Scripture while negotiating for movie rights and, incredibly, retained a cadre of folks who felt sorry for him. Gay groups raised funds, religious folk visited, women were supportive...it defies any kind of rational thought. Great book."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"This book was written so well you almost felt like you were in the heartland while the search for Eli Stutzman was going on.This book describes in cruel detail how selfish people can be. Many people in the book chose their anonimity over the well being of a child. People see a child \\"groping\\" men and rather than expose who they really are, they keep quiet and let a child suffer. Another watches in disgust as Eli masturbates with his child in the bed with him...If just one person would have come forward; little Danny might a young man today.And what a joke that Eli Stutzman is paroled..... his wife is dead, his son is dead, his roommate is dead.... all of which are the hands of this \\"mis-understood\\" Amishman..I hope Eli dies a slow and painful death.This is one of the best written true-crime books I've read.

It was very well written; I couldn't put it down! Even though, I feel that justice didn't prevail in this case, I am glad that I read the book. It really opened my eyes to some of the horrific events that occur in our country. The author expained important facts about the Amish and their beliefs, as well as outlined the perp's descent into his murderous actions against the ones that professed to love, including his Amish wife and his innocent son. He was also suspected in three other murders in the gay community, one of which got him a little time in jail! Highley recommend this book, even if the ending is a bit of downer!"},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"Having trouble imagining the words \\"Amish man\\", \\"murderous parent\\", \\"gay stud muffin\\" and \\"whacko\\" in the same sentence? What about in the same sentence used to describe one man? In the words of Dewey Cox: How's your mind? Blown? Well, it should be.Eli Stutzman - Amish farmer, race horse trainer, thief, drug addict, staggeringly promiscuous gay man, horrible husband, lousy date, despicable house guest and the worse father ever - is nothing is not a modern day renaissance man. Name two things that don't belong together and they can probably both be used to describe Eli. This book tells two stories simultaneously. One is about Little Boy Blue, a young boy who's corpse is found in a ditch on Christmas Eve. The other is about the boy's father, Eli, who left the boy in the ditch. On the one hand we have people of conviction and dedication who seek to do right by a boy they never knew in life. On the other hand, we have Eli.One might expect to feel a bit of sympathy or at least pity for a young man who comes to understand that he is something that his society can never accept or acknowledge. It can't be easy to be gay and Amish. It's not an easy society to understand either. The low Amish don't allow electricity or buttons, but they let the young sow their wild oats during \\"rumspringa\\" and forbid kissing but allowing \\"bundling\\", aka, sleeping together fully clothed. Girls who allow favors too freely are known to bundle \\"too hard.\\" Eli consorts with a few hard bundling gals before settling down with a nice Amish girl who, wouldn't you know it?, up and dies during a barn fire. The neighbors help Eli raise a new barn after which Eli promptly gets up to activities in the barn that aren't on the floor plan. You'll never look at a barn the same way after hearing about a few of Eli's drug and sex barn parties. Barn burners, indeed. Eli leaves the Amish community and embarks on a series of relationships made possible by the 1970s equivalent of Craig's List, The Advocate. The best part of Eli's schtick is that he keeps his Amish clothes for costume parties. Apparently broad brims are quite the turn on in certain circles. More than once while reading this book I found myself humming Weird Al's \\"Amish Paradise\\" - yes, even Ezekiel would have thought Eli's mind was gone. The law catches up with Eli but he doesn't get what he deserves. Not surprising since what he deserves involves being burned alive in his own barn and that's just for what he did to his son.Few writers could tell a story that encompassed the restrictive lives of the \\"low\\" Amish, the gay scene of the late 1970s and the police investigation into the death of a child without giving into hyperbole or cliches. Gregg Olsen is that rare writer who can not only avoid those pitfalls he can deliver an entertaining book.Whether he's writing about white trash, Munchhausen by proxy or Amish Boys Gone Wild, Olsen writes about his subjects and their beliefs with genuine compassion and respect. Olsen may pass judgement but he never looks down on his subjects. His talent and his integrity make Olsen's books a must for the library of every series True Crime fan."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"In this true life account of the actions of a former member of the Amish community, we find out the details of the life of an evil man, but are left wondering why. Perhaps the answer is known only to the perpetrator, or perhaps he doesn't understand himself. Narcissism at its worst."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"I'm an avid \\"true crime\\" reader and was recently turned onto author Gregg Olsen by a friend. I purchased his book in my hometown of Jackson Twsp Ohio. Being a resident of Ohio and living very near to the Amish Community I found the book particularly interesting. My husband and I are within 10 minutes from the Massillon Community Hospital where Eli was once employed. It gave me goose bumps reading that he was once so close to where I lay my head at night! This book is absolutely RIVETING! A true page turner to coin a phrase! Gregg keeps you utterly spellbound as you read from page to page! YOU WILL NOT PUT IT DOWN! So, to all the true crime fans out there...FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELTS for an awesome, mind bending journey through the mind of a severly tortured individual! I would reccomend this book to anyone!Bravo Gregg! AND PLEASE KEEP THEM COMING!L, OwensOhio, USA"},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"The actual story of the murder is a real page turner. However, there is a LOT of sexually graphic content that made me want to hurl. I only read one of the descriptions of the ways gay men have sex...something called \\"RIMMING\\"...Good GOD...that was enough...and I actually got sick; physically sick from that description. I had been skipping over all the other areas of sexual descriptions but \\"rimming\\" didn't sound like a sex thing to me until I read it...after that I was careful not to read any of the other descriptions of what gay men do...although I don't think there is anything that can be worse than \\"rimming\\". Jesus. That was just too disgusting.The actual murder case however, is an excellent read and the court trial on this freak. Eli Stutzman is a real filthy type of \\"thing\\"...he is less than human in my eyes. He is a horrible person who deserves to be tortured slowly to death IMHO. Sick? Yes; perhaps. But no excuses for this filthy freak.The poor child in this book suffered terribly; so another recommendation is to not read the book at all if child abuse really upsets you as the description of what was done to this poor baby is also graphic and very upsetting. In order to read this book, you need to have a very strong constitution. If squeamish, don't read it. Had I known about the extreme graphic sexual content, I would NOT have bothered to buy this book...because there is a LOT of that throughout the book. There is mention of a lot of ways gay men have sex; and after reading the section on \\"rimming\\", I just skipped over all the other descriptions. That is what made this book only a 2 star for me...it would have been an excellent book without all that nasty crap. Simply saying he was engaged in an intimate encounter with each lover would have been sufficient. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on it."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"Abandoned Prayers was very interesting as well as shocking from beginning to end. I enjoyed learning the ways of the Amish, and to read about all of the things that Eli did. I was amazed by all of the lies and all of the crazy things that he did especially having his young son there to live through all of it. I did run into some confusion trying to remember all of the different names in the story, but other than that I loved Abandoned Prayers."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"I just finished the book and it didn't take me long because I just had to find out how this man would get caught and how he would be punished. I give it a 4 instead of 5 because I had a difficult time keeping all the characters straight. It was very well researched and it is too bad that the investigators couldn't pull off this much evidence. I ended up wanting to know more. I read here that Stutzman has been paroled, but I was unable to find any information with my internet searches. That would be such a kick in the head for justice. I do believe as the author does that he indeed killed 5 people including his own son."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"The story of \\"Little Boy Blue\\" is just what Olsen describes it to be: shocking! As a Nebraskan, I remember when Danny Stutzman's body was found frozen near Chester, Nebraska, and I followed local news accounts of the investigation. I didn't really know the story, however, until I read Olsen's account of little Danny Stutzman's life and death. Olsen's thorough investigation and interviews and his powerful writing of Danny's story leaves no doubt about the identity of Danny's murdered. So why has Danny's killer never been brought to justice??"},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"I just finished this book. Could not stop reading it until I was finished. I am in total amazement how long this creature was allowed to do &quot;his thing&quot;. How many people stayed quiet. It is a reminder of where our society has gone. I am sure with his medical condition there are more murders that he will never be charged with. I remember when this little boy was found, but never really heard anything about it after that. I was just amazed."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"When I was about eleven read this book for the first time. A lot crossed m mind and the photographs stuck in my mind forever especially the one taken after his death. I think to many people are desensitzed to these things. I still would think about it many years later. Few years ago searched for this man onine to find out that a post was made by a man who knew him. Apparently he went on to have a life where he had friends who had no clue about any of this. How fair is it to do something so horrible and not go to jail then go on with life as if nothing happened. get lack of evidence and so fourth sets many killers free but it doesn't make the heartbreak any less. Gay or Straight this many would have been a murdering heartless monster. Is orientation did not make him what he was nor did his culture. It is hard to look at pictures of a Danny and not smile but also not cry at something so precious just discarded by what one can only call a monster...never a father."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"This book reflects extensive research and is very well written. It is a tad long, but I don't see where it really could have been shortened. It's neither overdone nor over-extended like some 400 page books. The homosexual and other sexual details were rather disgusting and a bit too much information for me. And, I could have done with out the animal cruelty. At least that wasn't too detailed. The details are very good and make one feel they were there. My one real gripe is that Gregg Olsen named every person in the sheriff's offices and police departments, told about them, and what they were doing when the calls came in--except for the most important people--the dispatchers. I got tired of reading \\"a dispatcher took a call\\" or \\"a dispatcher advised\\" type of wording. Names, opinions, and details about them would have been nice. The dispatchers are typically the first on the scene and the last to leave.Also, I'd like to have read more about the victim, Glen Pritchett. How was his family notified? Did they come to the trial? Where is he buried? What was his funeral like?"},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"I am an avid fan of true crime stories. I was initially attracted to this book because it was somewhat unusual with the Amish background. However, it was very confusing - too many people to keep track of - when they weren't all that important to this story. Also, there was very little 'meat' of the story, probably because all the facts will never be known - which made it frustrating - I kept waiting for the punch but there wasn't any. I found generally, there was too much information included to 'fill pages', I think - a lot of it really didn't add much information and I read through it all because I didn't want to miss anything - but a lot of it just 'led nowhere'.It was a very sad, true story - I can see why it's easy to say the father killed him and abused him - however, there really is no proof of that....seems that they loved each other and missed each other - I'm sure there's a big part of the story missing... in that light - it left an 'unsatisfied' feeling - more of an 'oh well', when I was done. I didn't find it 'shocking' - more sad that this happened to this little boy. No determination was made why this boy had on a baby outfit (for use of a better term) and everything else was more guesswork than factual....except for the fact that Eli was a great manipulator and found his way around, got help when he needed it and sympathy when he needed it. Just my 2 cents. I looked up Eli and found he died in 2007 from a self-inflicted stab wound (wish there had been an update at the end). I think personally, he was an unstable, tortured man and it's too bad the child was in his custody. Another slip through the cracks of our society."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"Not living too far from an Amish area I picked up Abandoned Prayers by Gregg Olsen. It has been many years since I purchased this book. Before I begin this review I would like to make reference to M. Scott Peck's book People of the Lie. Peck's work was a study in the spiritual dimension of evil. Before reading Abandoned Prayers I would suggest you read People of the Lie first. The subject of this book, Eli Stutzman, was evil. The author does a great job of telling us about the life of a serial manipulator who, it seems, murdered friends, acquaintances and most revolting of all his wife Ida and his own son, Danny Stutzman. (He was never convicted of either ot these crimes, but the author shows, sadly, that this was probably due to botched police and coroner work.) Based on the author's research we see an Eli Stutzman who from when he could form his first words lied about everything. His father, a strict Swartzentruber Amishman, saw right through Eli from his childhood. But, Eli's manipulation of everyone he came in touch with moves beyond the title of \\"sociopath.\\" Whether or not a person was Amish or \\"Englisher\\" Eli used a sorry tale to work his way into their psyche. Eli Stutzman was an individual caught up in the homosexual subculture of multiple constant sex partners. People only existed to feed Eli's desire for more sex and money. He used and abused everyone who came near to him. Reading this book I was revolted by Eli Stutzman and this speaks well of the author Gregg Olsen. Mr. Olsen paints a picture of pure evil. Eli Stutzman spent only 20 years in prison for the killing of one of his roommates. He was a suspect in at least two other murders of people who know him. Because of ill health he was paroled from prison. In the last few years Eli Stutzman committed suicide. If I have one complaint I would like to see the author of this book release a new edition with and addendum showing the life of Eli Stutzman in prison and any insights to his suicide. Finally, it should also cover the people who defend Stutzman's innocence until this day, most fascinatingly those include folks in the gay community and conservative Mennonites. This is non-fiction crime writing at its best."},{"Title":"Abandoned Prayer","review":"Eli Stutzman 56yrs old HIV gay man and a Swartzentruber Amish was found dead Feb 6, 2007 in his apartment in Ft Worth, Texas of self inflicted stab wounds. His body was never claimed.WHO WAS ELI ? Eli is the subject of a very good true crime book by Gregg Olsen. Gregg is almost as good as Jack Olsen.It was never proved that Eli killed his pregnant wife in a fire nor that he killed his son Danny 9rs old but he did go to prison for a short time for abandoning Danny's body in Nebraska. He was convicted of killing his room mate and employee Glen in Texes and served time there. He was thought to be responsible for the deaths of several gay men in different states.One reviewer says that ELI HAD NO SOUL. They are so right. There was no heart nor soul. Just EVIL. I hope he suffered greatly.Eli always said that Danny died from an illness and he left the body out where GOD COULD FIND HIM.You will have to read this book and make your own decision on whether he killed him or not.This book is not for the prudish..you will learn a lot (more than you want to know) about gay/male sexual practices.

Ms. Molenda is portrayed to be an expert, however, she hasn't really given a lot of good information in this book. I question some of her methods in the care of handfeeding and formula content. Misleading information like this can confuse a new breeder. She shouldn't have written in absolutes but recommendations instead. I have found other breeders that have more information and are much more knowledgeable in Parrotlet care. Unfortunately, they have not written a book.

All of them enjoyed it very much and I did, too. I'm often disappointed in the writing quality of Christian fiction, especially for children, but I was very pleasantly surprised by the level of this one. I lived in Taiwan myself for about six months and found the descriptions spot-on with what I remembered. I see that Deb Brammer has written another book and I'll be buying it, and I hope she will also write more stories about Taiwan and the Chinese culture.

A great piece of work Deb!"},{"Title":"Peanut Butter Friends in a Chop Suey World","review":"I recently found a book called Peanut Butter Friends in a Chop Suey World, written by Deb Brammer. When I heard it was about a girl my age on the mission field I decided to read it.It all starts with a girl named Amy, who is very exited to be going to Taiwan as a missionary. When she gets there she tries making friends with her Chinese neighbors, but it is not working out. Then she meets Jessica, the most popular girl in her school. She soon realizes Jessica is trying to get her to avoid a specific Chinese girl named Mickey. Amy struggles with the fear of what her school friends might think of her if she chooses Mickey over Jessica. When Amy tries to make friends with both Jessica and Mickey, Jessica turns her back on her. How does it end? You'll have to read the book!In this book, Amy learns about trusting God and choosing the right friends. I loved this book because being in a missionary family myself, it helps me remember to trust God. When I first heard we would be leaving everything I knew and moving to a new country, it was kind of hard for me to trust God at that moment.If you like reading books that teach you spiritual lessons, you would love Peanut Butter Friends in a Chop Suey World.

More ironic is the fact that some of the images are from the early 1990's and they sit very easily alongside the images from the 1960's. The whole book is fascinating, there is not a single image that looks contrived.It's difficult to summarise the overall impresssion you get from this book, it's probably one of pride and as the title says 'graft' - it's not at all depressing or grim, quite the opposite in fact.

While it is very non-traditional, it provides a bridge that helps the modern person to relate some of the most important concepts of Buddhism through the bridge provided by Western existentialist thought.This book is very well written and Stephen Batchelor is very credible as an author having spent considerable time in Asia and having been a monk for 10 years in both the Tibetan and Zen traditions. While the book is largely his own perspective, it is a valuable one given his life experience and ability to convey complex topics in easy to understand terms. It certainly got my attention!If you are looking to read your first book on Buddhism or Existentialism, this is probably not for you. However, if you are familiar to one or both of these topics and/or are looking to understand the human condition more deeply, then you will not be disappointed at the ideas presented here.For me, this was a two sitting book that completely engaged me. I have read many books on Buddhism and Existentialism and thought this had a lot to offer a modern person in terms of making Buddhism relevant to modern contexts. I also found it a useful and sensitive exploration of the nature of loneliness and the limitations of the human condition. Among other things, it poignantly expressed how loneliness and the reality of our ultimate death could help us deepen our experience of reality through relationship and fuller engagement with life."},{"Title":"Alone with Others: An Existential Approach to Buddhism","review":"I've read this book three times and each time I get more out of the reading. The author is able to break down, explain, and connect the various Buddhist approaches with insight and clarity. Sometimes the language and references can be challenging (there's a glossary in the back) but his take on the commonalities of Buddhism and Christianity are some of the best and they are motivating me to read Paul Tillich, John MacQuarrie, and Martin Heidegger just to find out more. Highly recommended reading."},{"Title":"Alone with Others: An Existential Approach to Buddhism","review":"I sense the author is just pushing his own view on buddhism (or... existentialism) through this book: this is not a study of the crossroads between buddhism and existentialism, but the author's own view on buddhism expressed in the terms of existential thinking.St. Batchelor in this book holds a view about buddhism very much close to that of contemporary Vietnamese zen buddhism. They see the world as manyfold manifestations all sprung from one unique universal 'tank' ('alaya vijnana'); consequently they hold the view that all things and beings in this universe are linked together in complete solidarity. This is one view: but this is not really essential either to buddhism or to existentialism. It also seems to me somewhat oversimplified as a moral and as a cosmic hypothesis. Personal responsability and gratuitous compassion are closer to ancient, theravada buddhism.Anyway, I much preferred--and would recommend--the same author's \\"Buddhism without belief\\" as a contemporary, 'modernist' approach to the ageless and visionary wisdom of buddhism!"},{"Title":"Alone with Others: An Existential Approach to Buddhism","review":"This is a fantastic book...but it may never become the widely-read classic it deserves to be. The reason is that it is written \\"inspired by\\" the language of Martin Heidegger's existentialist masterpiece Being & Time. If you've never read Being & Time you might struggle to make sense of the significance of such terms as \\"Being Alone\\" and \\"Inauthentic Being-with-Others.\\" These terms, and many like them, were used and fleshed out in Being & Time. Without this background the reader could perhaps miss the full picture that Batchelor is trying to convey. I don't mean this as a value judgment - you have either read Heidegger or you haven't. I've read Heidegger, but not Wittgenstein, for example. No shame in that. I took a class on Heidegger's Being & Time while in college. I found it to be both the most difficult book I've ever read and one of the most rewarding. Because of this previous exposure to Heidegger, I was able to get right into Batchelor's flow in this wonderful book. Perhaps I am wrong about this. I wouldn't want to discourage anyone from reading this book. It really is a little masterpiece.In any case, Batchelor does a wonderful job of contrasting Authentic and Inauthentic Being Alone and Being with Others. If you have had exposure to Existentialist thinking, particularly Heidegger and are interested in an analysis of Buddhism using that terminology and approach, then this is THE book for you."},{"Title":"Alone with Others: An Existential Approach to Buddhism","review":"The author, who is very knowledgeable about the subject, helps explain why Buddha talked about despair and anguish and offers some insight into how the human condition can improve using Siddhartha's methods.

The dreams of most prospectors never panned out, including one of the key investors back East, John. D. Rockefeller.

This book discusses the establishment of the Werwolf, and covers a long series of their exploits: sabotage, sniping at allied troops, and leaving behind poisoned liquor for the Russians. A young HJ member's valiant retaliation against a Russian officer who accosted his sister is discussed, along with the further crimes the Red Army perpetrated in response. The famous last-ditch Alpine Redoubt is covered in detail.This book also discusses the significant differences in attitude toward the Allied invasion in different districts of Germany. The fate of ethnic Germans living in Alsace, Malmedy, Poland, and the Sudetenland receives a considerable amount of attention.The book can become rather depressing at times, because of the utter hopelessness of the war at this point, and the attrocities commited against German civilians and POWs by the Allies. However, it remains a very compelling tale none the less.
