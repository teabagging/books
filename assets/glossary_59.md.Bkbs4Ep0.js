I am a very fast reader usually, but the horrible writing and the ridiculousness of the story just kept making me put the book down. I really wanted to throw the book away, but i kept searching and hoping for some great revelation, so i eventually finished it. How do i feel now? Like i wish i could get that portion of my life back. The message was hokey, the story telling was stupid, and the writing was garbage. Did i really need to read 200 pages to understand Dan's message of living in the moment and being happy? Nope.

Inspirational, perhaps. (Though surely not as inspirational as the many true stories of people who have overcome exceptional setbacks such as cancer). But it escapes me how so many reviewers can assert that this book has been life altering since it offers little more than spiritual truisms? How many people read the book and do anything differently? Do they become vegetarians? Or gymnasts? Or do they hang around gas stations waiting to meet their mystical master? Far better for someone to actually take lessons in Tai chi or Aikido which provide practical means to put some of the tenets in Way of Peacful Warrior to work.Way of Warrior seems to be a compilation of various spiritual paths: a little Zen, a little Aikido, a little Castenada, a little _____ (fill in your favorite new age discipline). In the 1970s there was a popular book making the rounds called &quot;Be Here Now,&quot; which proffered the Eastern principle of living in the moment.If you want to read a book that might challenge your conceptions of how you approach the world, try Pirsig's &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.&quot; If you want a book to provide some practical advice on following a non-western spiritual journey, try William Reed's &quot;KI - A Path Anyone Can Travel&quot; which offers actual methods for breathing, meditating, healing, living.Parting shot -- Dan Millman should have taken more writing courses at UC Berkeley. Maybe then he would have avoided the juvenile, melodramatic style that he succombs to."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"While I enjoyed the book, there were aspects of it that just didn't allow it to leave the impact a lot of other people felt.I found the dialogue written far too poorly for my taste. People just do not talk like that. It was far too corny, and it really took me out of the story quite a bit, smiling at how absurd some of it was. I was also, surprisingly, turned off by the whole \\"magical\\" aspect of the book. Stories like this always seem to work best when you believe they could happen. With this one, I found myself openly thinking to myself (quite often), \\"I'm supposed to be buying into this?\\"I thought it was a decent story, and I can certainly tell it is something that could be very meaningful to some people. It just didn't touch me."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"In some ways the movie is better than the book; in some ways the book is better than the movie.

However, I didn't find much inspiration in &quot;The Way of the Peaceful Warrior.&quot; Dan's whole journey of self-discovery seemed incredibly selfish and isolating, almost the essence of a male model of success (not a model that all males would agree with, but a model based on stereotypically male values and power). I wonder if others have noticed this--if women in particular have felt alienated by the path he took and message he puts forth. Dan's first wife and daughter sure seemed to get pushed aside, and his union with Joy read like pure fantasy. I know they are really married, and I wish them all the happiness in the world, but to me Dan's story read like a cautionary tale to make sure people don't make life-long commitments until they have a better idea of their own identities.

Now, the content of the story looks fine, but the technical translation from print to eBook leaves much to be desired. Within the first chapter, I found numerous spelling errors that quickly took me out of the reading experience and, at times, left me trying to decipher what the author intended. Given the fact the book has been in print for more than 20 years, I quickly deduced the eBook was beset with translation issues. Even at a discount off the price of a traditional book, the eBook should have to meet standards of quality, which appeared to be lacking.I am wrestling with a decision to either go out and buy the hard copy version or stick with the eBook, but no matter what, I am planning on continuing my reading experience with this author and subject."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"This is a fantastic book that carries on deep philosophical knowledge despite the author's humbleness to suggest its imaginary contents.

Start living now."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"The reason i bought this book was because i liked the element of 'living in the present' which was displayed in the film, so i wanted to dig deeper by reading the book. Reading through the book i enjoyed the easy-to-read and high detail explanation of the main character's journey. But as i went deeper into the book i just noticed that it was obviously 'New Age', now that is something most people won't argue about, and i don't hate some of the truths in it, but i don't like the overall of that 'religion'. So even though i like the author's storytelling and some of the philosophy (like the one of living in the present) i don't go into the 'new age' being a christian. I can read a story of metaphors, but when the author makes the story into an obvious religion which contradicts mine, i can't go further. Now to end this review, i was satisfied with the storytelling and detailing but not with the overall philosophy."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I bought this book for my sister-in-law and she loves it...once she's finished with it is my turn.It's my understanding (word of mouth)that this book is worth it's weight in gold!Need to read it (analize)to give a really good review!"},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"In 1966, Dan Millman was a jock/Gymnast, obnoxious, a stud and a playah. While unable to sleep he goes for a walk or jog and goes to an all-night Texaco service station where he meets an aging hippy he nicknames \\"Socrates\\". Socrates is an enigma inside a riddle. Socrates gets Dan's attention by some how getting on to the roof of the service station in a few seconds, so Dan bugs Socrates trying to find out his secrets. Slowly he learns to stop being such a douche and becomes a decent human being.Over a course of two years Dan learns all these new \\"secrets\\" to life, when they aren't really secrets at all. Socrates and a girl name Joy teach him lessons of life. After reading this book, you may begin to notice the small details in life.So Socrates teaches Dan all he can and sends him on his way to live. Dangets married, has a few careers a kid, and eventually his marriage fails, he fails and goes on a long hike in the Sierra Nevada. Where he runs into Socrates again. They talk and talk over a couple of days. Dan eventually ends-up back in Berkley for one last meeting with Socrates, in which Socrates disappears, raptures away or goes back to his mothership (that isn't discussed in the book, in the book he goes into the bathroom and in a flash he is gone). Dan eventually is divorced and marries Joyce aka Joy. Dan Millman wishes Socrates could have been there, but realizesSocrates is there, he is everywhere.I highly recommend this book. It is a quick easy read. Enlightening and amusing. Dan will totally annoy you. But Socrates will not! It has the possibility of changing your life, if you employ Socrates' hippy teachings."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I bought the book immediately after the seeing the movie. Somehow, the movie had more of an impact; Dan isn't a natural writer, but his experiences are compelling, and well worth the read."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"A very well constructed story-guide to leading a more fulfilling life.

It's not that I don't have personal discipline, its just that the way the characters act in Dan's book is not condusive to modern living. I mean, I just don't have time to sit on a tire all day to think about how to be a humble person. I have to work 60 + hours a week to support myself in a very troubling economic climate, and when I try to live like Dan Millman would like me to live, it's just really hard being super-healthy, ultra-compassionate, intensely spiritual, super goal-oriented, etc., with all of the other duties I must perform every day. In 'Way of the Peaceful Warrior,' Mr. Millman introduces us to a strange character named 'Socrates', but this character is not the real Socrates from Greek times, but is as strange person who works at a gas station.Now, I sometimes exchange a few words with the people who work at the gas station when I go there, but they never seem to offer me too much advice beyond automotive products and snacks and debit cards and stuff. I mean, they are nice for the most part, and intelligent enough, but I just fear that the sort of people Dan Millman writes about in this book are not real sort of people, so it is not fair for Mr. Millman to put all these demands on us to live like Ghandi when we have problems like terrorist hijackings and a bearish economy to struggle through. I mean, I think I am a good person at heart, but c'mon Dan, what am I supposed to do? I only get about four hours of sleep a night as is. I think I should be reading 'How to Schedule three days in a row off of work in a year' instead of Dan's 'How to run around town looking for enlightenment when you don't need to worry about dealing with the pressures and realities of urban modern life.' Sorry Dan, but we all can't be authors with time to burn this sort of self-improvement stuff."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I'd like to start off my review by noting one thing about all the other reviews on this page.They are all written from the point of view of:1. I exist2. It was my choice to read this book.3. It is my choice to review it.4. I am deciding how I evaluate the information in this book....and on and on it goes.But what this book tells us, is that we don't exist, we don't control our actions, and the whole thing is a movie played by nothing, and watched by nobody. Therefore, reviewing this book, is contradicting what it teaches.There is one awareness in this world. Only one. And it is observing this movie being played. The individual people have no power over what they do, anymore than Frodo Baggins has power over what he does in The Lord of the Rings. Inside the story, he's controling his actions, but when you come out of the story, you see it's all prewritten, and none of the characters can change what happends. It's the same with what we would call \\"real life\\".99.9 percent of people who read this book, will think it's a great book because it's well written, and has an interesting story line, but 0.01 percent of people who read it, will come out of it realising that the Identity they thought they were is seperate from the Awareness that observes all.Dan Millman, as great a writer as he is, cannot do the impossible, and the impossible, is getting through to people that their character is not the awareness.As you are reading this review, i'd like you to catch yourself reading it from those four point I mentioned above. I can't get through to you, because you are listening from the point of view that 1. you exist, 2. it's your choice to read this review, 3. no matter what this review says, I still am who I am... and on and on.That's why the number of enlightned people in this world can be counted on 2 hands, because nobody takes on the possibility that they don't control their actions, and that they are not themselves.99.999% of humans have this brick wall around them, that all words pass through, on their way to them. The brick wall is made up of the same thoughts I mentioned above. Most people will never hear things, without knowing that no matter what they're being told, they exist, and they are who they are.So, Dan Millman did an amazing job, but for 99.9 percent of people it will not bring about spiritual enlightment.Thank you Dan Millman."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I had the delivery sent to a detention facility andbecause there are CD's included it was returned.

If anyone hasn't read Castaneda, I suggest you start withThe Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledgein which details are given of Shamanic knowledge and experiences.The entire \\"Peaceful Warrior\\" series allows the reader to journey with the narrator into experiences of spiritual transformation. I had originally read the \\"Way of the Peaceful Warrior\\" in my teens and found great inspiration in it then and now with more life experience I can understand certain experiences presented in the book even better. The book does change lives as the subtitle says and I've bought copies of this book for friends in my circle.I also recommend Nexus: A Neo Novel, which is the best book I've read since Dan Millman.

I read this book about 5 years ago and have never been the same. I experienced an awakening, as one might call it when they are being enlightened, while reading this book. This book opened doorways for me that i didn't know even existed. I was so interested in the subject that i finished the book in only a few sittings which at the time was fast for me b/c i was not reading much during that period in my life. I am now an avid reader and spiritualist and i can honestly accredit it to this book. Now would i have found my path from a different source had i not read The Way of the Peaceful Warrior? More than likely yes but for whatever reason this was the right story at the right time for me. For those of you who are already on \\"the path\\" i can't say whether or not this will change you but i do know it couldn't hurt to read it. Many copies of this book have gone through my hands and everyone i know who has read it has benefited from it's message. If you could use a little inspiration for life this could just do the trick and possibly make you a better person. Thank you Dan Millman!"},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"Yes, I felt this book was both inspired and original. It obviously has its roots in the human potential movement of the 70's, but that's not exactly a bad thing. One does wonder however if there's not a little too much said about the enlightened experience, or if the author has really tasted the silence of the all pervasive reality, the one that is ever present, simple, yet extremely difficult to perceive.But this is a great read for martial artists who are still caught up in the ego drama of competition, of winning and losing, and violence. It's tender in the right places, rather than gory like a movie. Even Bruce Lee falls short of the true meaning of the martial artist's true calling. It is a path that leads to enlightenment, and the demons you encounter are inevitably your own!"},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I read this book after advice from a friend who was at the time a brown-advanced belt in Karate. I was told to read it with an open mind not knowing what the book was about. I found it quite easy to get into but some bits were a bit laborious, never the less I carried on and finished the tale. There were times when reading this book that sparked emotions and feelings that I can only describe as not felt since I was a child. The end of the tale was utterly inspiring and I felt so different by the time I put it down, it deffinitly had an affect on my life and thinking and I would reccomend it be read by all. Take what you want from this book, I read it as a work of fiction and didn't expect to feel the way I did. I read the book in 1997 and want to read it again because I know that it changes my whole outlook on life."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I don't know if this book does indeed \`change lives' as it claims, but it does a good job of presenting a healthy philosophy of life.

This is a wonderful book for people who are willing to open their minds for new and interesting concepts of life. You don't have to accept every idea that you will find here, but I'm sure that you will find a few ideas that you would like to adopt.

It is filled with wisdom and heart, and manages to be entertaining as well. From Dan Millman's book, I went on to Joseph Campbell to the Dalai Lama to any number of other thinkers and people who are merging Western thought with Eastern spirituality... and all of it began for me with this book. There are no accidents. I stumbled upon this book in a bookstore in Atlanta a few years ago. The cover had the blurb that it &quot;changes lives.&quot; I didn't expect that much. But it indeed helped me to change my life. When I go back to it now, it's like visiting an old friend.

This book, however, is written so well and has such a great story that it keeps you interested and teaches a lesson at the same time.

If the reader allows him or herself to let go of &quot;Dan's&quot; personal struggles with his journey and realize that the massages being delivered are universal in their goal yet each individual's approach will and should vary drastically, this book offers an exceptional starting point in spiritual discovery and growth. We should also remimber that most if not all true mentors come from within and we shouldn't count on finding the mythical gas station guru to kick us in the pants an point us in the right direction.Despite any of my above criticism, I applaud this book, has it has been instrumental in assisting me in taking the next step in my own personal growth."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"If you choose to read this book then it is the right time for you to start the change.

It has got me looking at life through a different perspective. I rate this novel a five because Dan went through similar situations that I had gone through, and has gotten me thinking differently about the rough road ahead of me. He coped with the stress exceptionally well and he was also able to keep a positive mentality. Some of his experiences are very similar to mine so it was farely easy to relate to his thoughts. For example, he's an athlete going through college with very overwhelming struggles. He struggles and fights through rough experiences and still reaches graduation. He also hurts his leg in a brutal motorcycle accident which prevented him to compete in gymnastic competitions. I also had injured my leg playing a sport, and it's also preventing me from being active in my sports. He also is a unique individual that is eagared to suceed. He helps his team win a National Championship and also he finally becomes the warrior that he had been anticipating for quite a while. I admired his courageous heart and accomplishments that he achieved through the tough road to recovery. He also has a friend named, Socrates, that advised him how to cope with difficult situations in life, and how not to get discouraged. He helped Dan and I find our inner peace that's needed to pursue our goals in life.

Wow! It really is a life changer! I've read many books about life. This one is the best! It really creates a focus and balance on life. This book will open your mind and heart. I've given it as gifts to those I love and everyone who has read it has told me the same thing. A must buy! However, as good as Peaceful Warrior is don't read Millman's other books, Sacred Journey or Socrates. As most reviews have stated, they are a disappointment. My opinion is that Millman had one good book in him, and that was Peaceful Warrior. His only other book that was okay, was No Ordinary Moments. If you really want to read a book by Millman after Peaceful Warrior read No Ordinary Moments, but that's it! Lastly, another really good book is University for Success. Combined these two books are special!"},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"This is a very inspiring book. By the way, have you wondered who Socrates is and whether he is real? From my point of view it seems very clear that most of what Socrates says in this book is a direct take off the teaching of Adi Da Samraj, a spiritual teacher that Dan Millman was a devotee of in the 1970's in California. Being a devotee of Adi Da Samraj, myself, and being very familiar with his teaching, it is obvious that this is so. If you go to www.adidam.org you can find out more about this teacher who is alive today and who offers a relationship with all who yearn for real heartbreaking freedom and happiness. You can look up the essay on Divine Ignorance for the correlation of where Socrates talks on page 28 \\"You are ignorant of where the universe is; nor do you know what anything is or how it came to be. It's a mystery.\\" Adi Da Samraj's book of wisdom teaching for children \\"What, Where, When, How, Why, and Who To Remember To Be Happy\\" is also the same consideration written for children."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I am on the path to reading all of Dan Millman's books.

I have been studying Buddhist and Eastern philosphies for a while and I still had things to learn from this book. I see this book at an explanation of many Buddhist beliefs (such as 'no-mind' and 'live in the now'). I do think that this book is a great starting place for people that are interested in the buddhist way of life, but are having a hard time wrapping their mind around many of the Buddha's obscure concepts. I had to give it 4 stars as the editing is not up to parr. This may have been fixed in later editions, as I have a very old copy that I purchased from a used book store. The editing mistakes were so noticeable at some points that it interrupted the flow of the amazing story. Other than the errors, however, I was completely engrossed by the book.

I found Socrates's teaching style to be very ineffective. he wasn't teaching Dan how to live as much as he was teaching him to follow orders. maybe Dan needed structure, very common in Red stage of development. at least Socrates touches upon what is to me the most effective and evolved method of learning - contemplation, when he says you need test it out and experience it for yourself (which unfortunately constitutes 1 paragraph in the whole book). But it is outweighed by his teaching METHOD through out the rest of the book... which has nothing to do with leading Dan to awareness, but instead has to do with essentially teaching, im right and your wrong; its my way not your way... this is not contemplative education this is regurative education and the authoritative fallacies he uses teaches submission to authority. Dan does not care so much in transcending limitation as he does pleasing his \\"mentor\\" Socrates. which is also reinforced by Socrates. the behavior in itself, is a behavior seen in red stage of development. (which is fine, because you have to through each stage of development, but has nothing to do with transcendence and connection to the absolute). However Socrates ridicules Dan calling him a jackass countless times, in actuality, reinforcing egoic identification (doesnt seem like skillful means, in fact there are little to no skillful means in this book). the case can be made that he is trying to trigger Dan, but Dan is no where at the stage of development to do shadow work like this. Socrates is most likely traumatizing him instead. Conclusion, for integrally informed people: it seems this book maybe good for red stage of development, but lacks for higher stages of development. for non integrally informed and integrally informed people: Teaching methods used here seem like regurative education methods, authoritative fallacies - submission to authority. Its probably good if you need a father to tell you what to do, and if so than this book is probably good for you. for those off put by the teaching method, keep in mind its the teaching method - not what is being taught that is the issue here. the majority of what is being taught is zen and aikido and to me is legit. unfortunately, its the teaching method that often influences ones relationship to what is being taught. this book is basically summed up in \\"im right, your wrong. im awesome you suck. live my way, not your way.\\" and it just so happens that his way incorporates a lot of zen... his method however is irringly similar to fundamentalism. a lot of socrates conditioning influence his teachings, and its almost an unfortunate way to be introduced into zen, unless your at red stage of development (in my book). if you want a good book and are at higher stage of development, i suggest you check out \\" Shambhala, the sacred path of the warrior\\" by chogyam trungpa rinpoche, which seems to be for post modern +. if your modern, you might be interested in the dalai lamas work, hes a genius. and he seems to targets modern +, and also might be interested in sakyong mipham rimpoche works such as turning the mind into an ally. if you want a good intro to zen, you might be interested in zen mind, beginners mind. my disclaier is consider it, and decide for yourself. holding frame works and maps lightly, who is that is experiencing it all?"},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I really enjoyed this, some stages not sure if it was fiction or non fiction - good for the soul"},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"Book was in great shape and I received it in a timely manner.

A sincere try from Socrates - a real warrior, sage and probably more than that. I have completed the book in two days, just couldn't stop reading. Just amazing insights from Socrates - just invaluable in terms of the betterment of man kind it can cause. I thought the book would be same as the movie but it is much better than the movie and Socrates covers much more than Here and Now.I have one suggestion though, it is that in the end in the actual sense Dan did not open the Gate. He thought he did, but not really. What he had is an experience, not a realization. An experience sometimes stays on the person and would have a temporary affect of not using the mind. But only when Self Realizes the truth then and only then it can be free from mind. So Dan should keep going in his search."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"It was hard for me to get through this book although I understood many of its themes. I think that the author failed in trying to write a \\"novel\\" out of his personal spiritual experience. I was hoping that there would be more of a deeper philosophical discussion behind his narration but rather I found the reading rather dry and unengaging. Maybe the simplicity of the book is deliberate, as \\"Socrates\\" would have prefered. But for a book that \\"changes lives,\\" I expected that there would be more of a discussion of the journey of the spirit."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"i read this book because i saw that it was apolo anto ohno's favorite book. i thought it would give me insight as to how this 19 year old became not only a skating star, but such a young guy with a not so young spiritual temperment. this book will make you a fan of dan milman, and certainly a fan of apolo.it' a quick, easy read for anyone, any age. a year ago i started on my own personal path as a peaceful warrior and this book made me realize i was and am on the right path. after reading this book it affirmed my decision to stop and smell the roses and enjoy life, ride a bike, smile and enjoy the few laps around the sun we get. i have a lot of friends in the internet/technology world who are going thru a lot of stress, doubt, worry these days. all they worked for is quickly spinning around and down the drain and there's little to show for it. i left many who would have cut their own mother's throat to achieve extreme internet wealth, starter palaces and perceived power. today they are lucky if they have conscience enough to keep a peanutbutter and jelly sandwich down. if you know of anyone headed off to college or kids in college, or maybe someone whose life is taking a turn for the worse buy this book for them. the book won't change their lives, but it will help them change, and enjoy their lives if they are open to doing so."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"The one useful lesson of this book is that we should all live in the present moment, without fretting over the past or the future. Every other insight seems half-baked, in part because young Dan Millman seems unfamiliar with any spiritual tradition of the East or West.Challenged by his mentor to say where he is, for example, Millman does not know. To be fair, the mentor won't accept a conventional address. He wants to know where the universe is, and Millman doesn't have faith or experience enough to say \\"in the mind of God,\\" as one of the children in Thornton Wilder's play, \\"Our Town,\\" did. Stumped by questions like that and his mentor's puzzling answers to them, Millman falls for every New Age nostrum in the book. \\"Feel more and think less\\" becomes a key insight, even though it confuses innocence with primitivism and falsely implies that thought is always an obstacle to enlightenment (Thomas Aquinas could have disabused Millman and his mentor of that hilarious notion all by himself). Death to self loses most of its sacrificial character and becomes just another check off item on the list of things necessary for self-fulfillment through 'unreasonable happiness.' Meanwhile, Millman trips merrily along, wracked by doubt but winning gymnastics meets and boffing pretty groupies.Anyone looking for a better chronicle of the relationship between an old warrior and his young apprentice would do well to read Tom Brown Jr.'s book, 'The Tracker,' instead. That story comes from the same era but has more wisdom. Millman fans are advised to pass up \\"Peaceful Warrior\\" in favor of his later work in books like \\"The Inner Athlete.\\""},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"This book has been on my short list ever since I read Millman's The Journeys of Socrates last year, which I absolutely loved. I found that book to be a vivid, suspenseful, and captivating story that I definitely plan to read again.I was therefore quite surprised that Way of the Peaceful Warrior was extremely disappointing from almost the very first page. The writing is mediocre at best, and is sometimes even worse than that. The characters are two-dimensional, while Millman's descriptions of things, places, events, and even concepts central to the theme of the book are shallow and underdeveloped. Perhaps the worst aspect of the book is the absolutely wretched dialogue, which is always forced and unnatural, sometimes laughably so. It's just impossible to visualize people talking like the characters in this book and saying the things they say. At no point in the story did I ever feel even the slightest bit of suspense, awe, or wonder. There's almost no emotion in the book, and what little there is seems completely contrived. Millman admits at the end of the book that he wrote it in three weeks, and it really shows.I'm really amazed that so many people have rated this book so highly and that so many people say it changed their lives. This is not a deep, reflective, introspective book by any means. At best it is a second-rate self-help book. And this is coming from a person who was really looking forward to reading it. The reason I didn't give it just one star is that I did glean a few little nuggets of wisdom and insight here and there, but I could easily fit them on half a page of paper. It's not worth trudging through such a poorly written, boring, and uninspiring story just for that.I'm still at a complete loss to reconcile this train wreck of a book with The Journeys of Socrates. I supposed I can chalk it up to the fact that nearly three decades transpired between the books, and Millman must have learned how to write better during that time. I guess I'm just in the minority of readers who have very little positive to say about Way of the Peaceful Warrior. It's hard for me to imagine how this book has actually changed anyone's life in any major way. Obviously others enjoyed it immensely, though I honestly cannot fathom why"},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"This book is certainly not without its fine points of wisdom, mostly recycled, but you have to grind your way through layers and layers of cheese before you get to them. At the end, it won't leave a good taste in your mouth.It is hard to sympathize or relate to the woes of the main character who is a born world class champion without really trying, without having to sleep, rich enough to do and travel wherever he wants since his freshman year, doesn't have to study ever, can basically seduce and have any girl he ever wants on a whim and still is chosen among millions apparently by a Zen master of unlimited power to be trained into perfection. His trials and anguishes to \\"find himself\\"and his obsession with his happiness while giving zero concern to the welfare of the world at large are truly heartbreaking first-world problems.It doesn't help that the author is a mediocre writer at best. Take a pass on this one."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"Like many others who have read this book, I was blessed to receive it from a good friend, who insisted I read it.Now, I had always thought myself as a spiritual person. I am Pagan, not Christian...so let's get that cleared up right away.I believe that due to my own Pagan/Wiccan lineage, that this book helped reaffirm my faith in the Creator, for I have never considered It to be of any \\"gender\\". This is purely a human intervention.As it is, when I read this book, it truly changed my life. I had an epiphany, in a trance state, right after I finished the book. Once I was through, I felt light as air. It was if I was floating off the ground for nearly a week. And for that week, I could not wipe the grin off my face, for just being grateful for being alive, as well as just being. The gift of Life itself on this Earth became so profound to me after this book, which was many, many years ago.Granted, now I'm just an old Crone again, but I will always treasure this book, and probably should re read it, just to get that \\"fix\\" again. Granted, it is not a permanent experience, that is up to you. But for me, even though much of it has worn off over the years, due to many hard times, heartaches, divorce, the death of my sister, my friends, and slowly watching the people I was closest to, slowly start to fade away out of my life, by death, or by \\"growing apart\\", still, if it wasn't for this book, I don't think I would even be here still today to talk about it.Trust me. Trust everyone who has read it, and has anything positive to say about it. Hell, just buy the damn thing. For I'm not a person who really cares whether or not you do. I'm just telling you, that if it could change my way of thinking, and thus, change my entire life, just by the realization that you're thoughts become your experiences that you react to in life, then it can certainly change yours.Read the book. Enough said."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"Many people who read this book find themselves changed, even subtly, by the lessons within. I took it a step further. I am consciously applying these lessons and philosophies to my life.A little background.I'm 26, in the military, have an injured knee the doctors say will never recover fully and will hurt for the rest of my life, a failed marriage under my belt already, hate my job, find most of my coworkers intolerable, out of shape, diagnosed with anxiety, depression, insomnia.... the list goes on.I read this book two weeks ago.In that time, I have learned to be happy. I have learned to appreciate the world around me. Started getting along with my coworkers, mended old friendships that were crumbling, my knee is almost fully recovered after a year of chronic pain, my eating is better, I am sleeping better, waking up easier, and every day is a good day. Nothing AROUND me has changed. Only how I react to it. It's not always easy. Things still bother me. I still get angry, or sad. But now, it passes faster and I return to what has become my natural state. Happiness. Peace.This book can change your life if you let it. It tells you how, if you will listen. Some of the book is fictional. Dan Millman has never made any secrets about the fact that he embellished to make it a more interesting read, and to really get across how amazing Socrates was. This is OK.Because frankly, it doesn't matter whether it is all a complete historical autobiography or not. The LESSONS are real, and the teacher was real. I do not believe there is anyone on earth who cannot find some benefit from learning the way of the Peaceful Warrior.Read this book. Let it simmer in your thoughts. Let it guide you to the Way.

It's simple, straightforward with some basic wisdom.CONS:- Poor, infantile writing. Full of cliches. Predictable.- It's a shame that the author didn't write in the 3rd person. It would have been more effective, like Og Mandino's outstanding books. I had the same problem with \\"The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari.\\" It's another book like this one. The author pretends he's the impulsive idiot and he meets some wise guy. It's a fine concept, but it's poorly executed here, just like in the \\"Monk\\" book.- This is fiction, although he tries to make it sound real, and I'm sure many of these things did indeed happen, but any make believe is fiction).

But when I saw the movie recently, I realized that the messages apply to all of us, perhaps in different ways. In any case, now that 20 years have passed since the book was written, many of the messages contained in it have been repeated elsewhere but the author has a genuine, non-guru-ish way of writing and explaining them that make them more real. For me, the most profound statement involved the difference between knowledge and wisdom-- with wisdom being found in taking action. How many of us have great ideas but seldom act on them? Guess we're not so wise. I have to admit, though, (and I think this is a first for me because I always prefer a book over a movie)-- I preferred the movie version. I think the director and writer beautifully take the essence of the book and find a way to make it cinematic without losing the meaning. They took key elements of plot and message and made them come more fresh and alive than in the book.

Tough love and critisism are applied with abandon.

About two years after reading it the first time, I felt like I needed to do something to really change my life, and so for guidence, I re-read this book. The second time through, it depressed me. I listened to all the things Dan's mentor was telling him, and I started to believe that this was the only way to live correctly; that if you didn't life the life of a peaceful warrior, you were wasting your life. This was made worse by the fact that I had no mentor like Dan's. It later dawned on me that this book should be used as a guide, rather than a road map to happiness.

I've read it multiple times. And every time it reminds me of important things and helps me in my life. It chronicles the journey of a man struggling to find himself, something most people I know can relate to, not to mention myself. It tells of his discovery of what he was looking for, his purpose, it helps you to do so also. This book changes the way you think and affects your life in many ways, it teaches you about moral and purpose and the realities of life. Although it isn't one of the most extravagantly written books, Dan Millman does an incredible job of conveying his message through his medium. This book is truly a work of art.

I think it is especially good for young people who need some guidance in life.For the people who think the story is simplistic or too geared for young people you may want to try the Evolution of a Warrior by Regan.

The book is very direct, and simple, which is exactly what I needed to get on with my journey. I have read this book 5 or 6 times in the last 10 years, and it is always helpful. Make sure you read Sacred journey also!"},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"The book makes you do alot of thinking about life.

Highly recommend"},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"... a book that changes lives. The character of Socrates impacted my life in many overt and covert ways, all for the positive. I read the book over ten years ago and the residue of its impact still lingers. The characters are lifelike and genuine, and their dilemmas resonate with much of humanity. I strongly believe that anyone can benefit from reading this book."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I borrowed this book from a friend of mine back in 2002. Since then, I have bought about 6 copies. Each time, I gave a copy to a friend that I thought needs a place to start from, a first step to start a journey into the spiritual world.This is a great introduction to an interesting journey into spirituality. This book got me started reading about spirituality. I recommend it to everyone. It is simple and easy to read. Once you start it, you won't be able to put it down easily. I also realized that I tend to re-read it every year.I am about to buy my 7th copy.Good luck"},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I heard of this book from a friend and saw many positive reviews of it here, so I really wanted to like this book. I like the idea behind the concept of a 'peaceful warrior.' The book tells a story similar to Fight Club, where you're not real sure if Socrates is real or imaginary. The book offers some interesting concepts, but also defies logic and reasoning in several instances. For example, this guy can touch his hands to your temples and you blackout and go on a 'hallocinogenic trip.' When you awaken, he knows what you've seen and experienced while you were passed out. How? The guy can jump from the ground to the roof of a building. How? It's never truly explained and defies the laws of gravity and common sense.One story in the book that bothered me was towards the end that read 'A saintly woman was walking along the edge of a cliff. Several hundred feet below her, she saw a dead mother lion, surrounded by crying cubs. Without hesitation, she leaped off the cliff so that they would have something to eat.'This is logic? What do they eat next? Maybe mom lion wasn't really dead? Why not just feed them?Over all, if you enjoy self-help books that are written like a novel, such as the Celestine Prophecy, then you may like this book. If I wanted to read a fictional novel, I would've purchased one. I was looking for new age self-help and this book fell very short of that.Besides the fact that these events take place in the late 60's, so much of society behaves differently today then what is described in the book. Also, the author must have one heck of a memory to recall dreams and converations that happened 30 years prior to writing the book.Over all, it seems very fabricated. As a novel, it's fine. But for self-help, it doesn't offer much."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"The way of the peaceful Warrior is a very good book. it has much practical wisdom for everyday living. Some of it is simply common sense with a sprinkling of fun and a vivid imagination. Some of it gets a little, &quot;woo&quot;woo&quot;.For exaple the main character is frequently called &quot;jackass&quot; by his mentor and on one occasion as this is happening, Dan looks into the mirror and sees himself with ears like a donkey accented with a bright yellow ribbon!Even with the odd-ball parts I would still reccommend it highly."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I will keep this short, but this book is wonderful. I am sorry but i have a tendancy to judge books by their covers when picking them up randomly. And this book almost was not picked up by myself because of its cover. Thank the lord i still picked it up because i have to say its in my top 5 books ever read. I am studying in philosophy and it has some spirituality/philosophy aspects to it ,so maybe thats why i like. All i know is that it is the perfect book to read. I am shur nobody can hate this book."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I have just finished this book (read it in 3 nights, couldn't put it down) and have a great sense of hope. I have read many other books with similar content but never one that kept my interest piqued through the entire book. This is not a &quot;how-to&quot; book, it is a story of one person's journey to enlightenment. It confirmed many of my beliefs and increased my understanding of many others. It was a 'joy' to share the story of Mr.Millman's journey and gave me hope for my journey. Well worth reading."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"There is no amount of stars that can be put on this book to give it an accurate rating.

The author made some good points about improving oneself and being a master of oneself, however, he injected the storyline with a lot of fiction. Some are realistic and most of the time believable. Nonetheless, it was entertaining and worth reading but don't change your life over night just to live by it. Plus, the movie didn't do the book justice. Way off from the storyline in the book."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"This book had many strong moments as well as weak moments. The points it tries-to- make at times were hard to follow."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"Inspiring and spiritual, this book gave me the \\"AHA\\" moment again and again. It was difficult to put the book down. I felt inspired and enriched by the words and wisdom throughout this book. Finding the 'Peaceful Warrior' within.

I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for that spark to begin their journey or just to add more beauty to their lives. Amazing read.Isabella Gentilin - Author of 'Whispers of an Angel'"},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I first purchased and read \\"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives\\" by Dan Millman back in 1984. I still have that copy that I paid $8.95 for. Actually, I've read that copy a number of times, and most recently I read the newer book I purchased that also contains an interview with the author about the making of the film starring Nick Nolte. (Notice how prices have gone up, that edition cost $12.95) I bought that and read it along with \\"Wisdom of the Peaceful Warrior: A Companion to the Book That Changes Lives.\\" I enjoyed the first book each and every time I read it, as did I enjoy the companion book. They are both enjoyable and educational. They make you think.For many years, nearing 20, \\"Way of the Peaceful Warrior\\" has been in my top favorite books. I don't know if I really have one single favorite, but if I had to list the top 10 in no particular order, this book would be there. It's a story that just connects with me, like it has for many people. The lessons Millman learns from his mentor, Socrates, the eccentric old warrior working at the gas station, are lessons that are profound, yet simple. Millman's spiritual odyssey reflects a searching I've also had, and the conclusions and answers that unfold in this autobiographical novel resemble the answers I've found on my own quest. Maybe this is because Millman, through his books and audio programs, has been one of my spiritual teachers and this first book especially has had a profound impact on me as I've sought answers along my own journey.The book contains a simple story really. The young Millman, successful on many fronts, still has a sense that something is missing. Through Socrates and the young woman, Joy, we read about Millman's awakening if you will. Along the way, you have the chance to share Millman's laughter and his pain. And maybe, if you are paying attention to your own life, you'll see how Millman's moments of illumination shine light onto your own path as you question the larger meanings of life and purpose. You also might just find yourself incorporating the Way of the Peaceful Warrior into your own living, and be doing so, find yourself on a path toward living in the now and happiness.I'm a huge fan of all of Dan Millman's work. I highly recommend you read \\"Way of the Peaceful Warrior\\" as the starting point for all of his teachings. It's one of my favorite books, and I'm sure I'll read it a number of more times in the future too.Reviewed by Alain Burrese, J.D., author of Hard-Won Wisdom From the School of Hard Knocks."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"Simply put, this is an excellent book. I see that Mr. Millman has a good heart. If people opine about this writing comparing it to \\"great works\\" and \\"gurus\\" then they need to go to the back of the station and return when they have something to say in \\"Love\\"."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"The Classic Edition of WAY OF THE PEACEFUL WARRIOR: A BOOK THAT CHANGES LIVES appears in a lovely hardcover for the first time since the book's initial publication in 1980, offering readers a fine spiritual odyssey telling of the author's own journey. His path to happiness offers many possibilities and reflections for others and this new gift edition will make a solid pick for libraries and individual giving alike."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I liked the thought provoking element of this book. It seems to me that the author is trying to compel the reader to think through his or her own life and to come to certain spiritual conclusions. The book is a narrative of the life of Dan Millman and is done well. There are times that I got lost with what the author was trying to convey but overall, I will rate this book as a good read if one wants to think through their own life's journey and how they have dealt with it."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"The book is a good read and has good life lessons entwined in an entertaining story. Although I believe the protagonist was selfish throughout the story, the idea of better living, feeling and thinking came through."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior, MillmanThis book takes the reader on a journey, following the course of one man's life and his becoming, if you will. I use the word becoming, because that encapsulates for me what this book is about. Dan Millman becomes a Peaceful Warrior, and this book encourages us to do the same. Now we don't have teachers like Socrates to guide us as well as Millman had, nor do most of us, I imagine, have the time to devote to the teachings that we would have had while younger and without adult responsibilities. But there is within these pages a story, and it is a story that kindles within me the desire to be more than I have been, and to experience and live life more than I am now.There are a few things that I really like about this book. First, the concept of internal alchemy. Alchemy is the process (legendary) of turning lead, or other cheap materials, into gold. Internal alchemy involves turning bad, destructive feelings and emotions into positive, constructive feelings and emotions, which hopefully will then translate into our actions and attitudes. Most notably, anger can be transformed into humor that can be positive instead of destructive. He also teaches about anger as a potentially positive thing, however, in that anger motivates us to change. Fear and sorrow inhibit us, while anger, when properly understood and channelled, can motivate positive change in our lives. I see much truth in both of those thoughts.Additionally, I like Millman's revelation that there are no ordinary moments. A bit later he journeys in his mind back to when he was an infant, and he recalls (?) crawling on the carpet, and feeling the carpet touch him, and smelling a rose, and experiencing so much of the world as an infant. Today we lose much of that experiential element because we are just going through the motions.I also find his teachings about the mind quite fascinating, although I struggle to understand exactly what he is saying. He seems to say the mind is a bad thing, a negative thing, and a later development in our lives that is not necessarily a good thing. Is he talking about the mind as superego? I am not sure, but he goes so far as to say that the fall from grace in the Garden of Eden involved Adam and Eve developing their minds. In some ways, this is true, I guess. But I still struggle to fully grasp it.The book ends well, and leaves us to grapple with how much of the book is true and how much is fiction. Regardless of whether it is 'true' or not, the entire book still teaches 'truth.' I am not comfortable with the panentheistic concepts to which Millman alludes, but still liked the book overall and am challenged to live each moment as an extraordinary one."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"Reading about the search of a young student was great...it gave me inspiration on how to become happy and a better person.

I lost myself in the images of the story. Taking myself to the places than Mr. Millman traveled through. I looked within myself and found that I was and am better than I thought. I highly recommend this book for troubled minds and for teenagers who are stuggling with who they are and were they belong. It makes you think and it actually enlightens you, resoluting in peace of mind. I look forward to reading more of Mr. Millman's books."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"When I first read this book, I literally felt myself changing. It was like I woke up to the life I had been missing. I realized what was real and what wasn't, plus I began to understand the power of living in the present. I have now read the book many times and have passed it on to others. Purchasing this book was one of the best decisions I have ever made in my life."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I knew almost nothing about this book when I picked it up. As I began reading I was amazed, rivited. I made my best friend read it, and we spoke of nothing else for weeks. It changed the way I think, act, eat, and even how I see the world.

It does not scare off the Highschool student or Janitor, it opens its doors to all types of people by telling a story. The meaning in this book goes far deeper than the words on the page. Some who read this book will read a story. Millman is writing beyond the story, and those who are so bothered after reading this book that they can't look at a tree the same way, were truly ready for its lesson. I lived with the notion that I understood far more than I ever wanted to at a young age, I always felt I got&quot;it&quot; the &quot;it&quot; that nobody else did. This book gave me direction in realizing what that &quot;it&quot; was and how to accept what I knew. The main feeling I walked away with, good or bad, was that I could no longer pretend I did not know the answers."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"This is definitely one of the best books I have ever read. It is very spiritual and philosophical. After I read it I wanted to get up and change my life and thats exactly what I did. I very much recommend this book to any one who is going through a hard time in their life and to people who like to read good books."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"Based on the comments of another reviewer, I read both Millman's book and the Evolution of a Warrior by Christopher Regan. While I agree with the other reviewer that Regan's book is more powerful in some respects (IMO), I believe Millman's novel is also a must read for anyone trying to follow the way of a warrior. Millman's novel is especially well suited for a younger readers (like early teens). The Evolution of a Warrior, with its sex and seduction scenes, is better suited for a more mature audience."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"This book is a wonderful way to look at yourself and where you are at in life. Dan Millman did a marvelous job telling a story that are compelling and mesmerizing, and every minute reading it is every minute closer to self-discovery and enlightenment. Teens should really read this book because; I myself a teen know what teen goes through. Even with all my success and achievement I still was unhappy like Dan in this book, through simple ways of looking at various things this book have change the way I lead a more peaceful and fulfilling life. It is fit to call this book \\" The book that changes lives\\""},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I had heard of this book for years and never got around to reading it. Finally, I did. I thought it was fantastic. I think many people will get too tied into some of the suggestions made by Socrates. It is important to remember this is a book of fiction. It illustrates certain points, but is unreal. It is not meant in anyway meant to be taken litterally. It is a story of inspiration. In it's plot it has many twists and turns, and I found that while reading it I was always trying to figure out who exactly Socrates was and where the book was going. As the book states, &quot;Stay in the present. You can do nothing to change the past, and the future will never come exactly as you hoped.&quot; This is the message of the book. Simple, Yes, easy, not usually. Incidently I did read an interview with Dan Millman and Socrates was a real person, but he was not superhuman. His greatness in the book is only meant as a parable. It is a great story, and there are lessons that seem so obvious it is easy to gloss over them..The great paradox is that we &quot;know&quot; many things, without &quot;understanding&quot; If you tell someone who has never driven a car, they may know how to drive. But not until they experience &quot;driving&quot; will they fully understand it. It is through action that we really understand. The book is wonderful. enjoy!"},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"This is one of my all time favorites. It's a super fast read, and it makes the stress in your shoulders 100 pounds lighter. I read this book over and over again in high school (six yrs ago) and it validated the questions I was asking about who I was. (yes, I was, and still am, a flower child born 30 yrs too late).Dan's mentor Socrates takes an egocentric athlete and changes him into a soul searcher. What he gives to Dan, any reader can get too. This book talks about physical reality. It does not spend lots of time on ideas like reincarnation. ie. you do not have to be a &quot;new ager&quot; to enjoy this. Nor does it advocate drug use like the more classically sixties Casteneda books. Although there are similarities between Don Juan and Socrates.I have recommended this book to many people and all except one giant sceptic (and future heroine adict) loved it.If you are an old hippy who somehow missed this, or anyone looking for alternative philosophies written in the west with ideas more traditionally eastern, READ THIS!"},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I read this book two times and loaned it to a friend (but forgot which one) obviously to someone that I thought would appreciate it's contents. The message Dan is sending can be found in many books. This is just his way of sharing his adventure, which I have found to be very helpful. I am here to buy the book again. I want it in my personel library."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"The writing is a bit sloppy, Millman dabbles in misogyny(toothpaste Susie!?), and we once again run into the problem(also posed by Castaneda and Redfield) of presenting fiction as philosophical half-truth(or is it the other way around?).That said, this is a good book which made me feel a bit less alone in my feelings about man's potential for growth within the confines of American society. Millman does well to suggest the possibility of living in a state of &quot;no-mind,&quot; though he falters when assuming that this is achievable only through athletics(he was a gymnast. Hmmm....).I can honestly say that I've experienced much the same phenomenon when writing or reading, or throwing the occasional jump shot. Nitpicking? Of course(somebody had to give this sucker less than 10 stars, for God's sake). Overall, I'd recommend it, though deeper thinkers may become bored very quickly."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I bought this title for my kindle. I can't comment yet, on the entire work as I'm only half-way through.What I can comment on is, without doubt, the most POORLY edited book that I have ever read. Almost every page there is a typo that makes me stop and re-read the sentence to work out what was supposed to be written. This doesn't completely ruin the book but becomes kind of annoying that we pay for a book that wouldn't make it past a middle school english teacher's red pen!"},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"One of those books that I think of more as a living entity, whispering secrets in my ear about how to live a transcendental life right here on Earth.The book has equal merit when viewed either as a work of fiction, or as a biographical sketch. I believe that the mystical Socrates in the book is in fact Dan's higher self, urging him to reach farther and deeper than his &quot;stated&quot; abilities lead him to believe.The book should not be taken literally. I believe its main purpose is to hint at an existence beyond the mere mechanistic. I also get a sense of parallel universes with the girl Joy who initially represents the more enlightened/advanced student in his class-of-one, and later becomes part of his life - while being the same person in some multi-dimensional sense, she is temporally not the same person at all !Some very good pointers about breathing techniques and diet in this book. Other than that, I believe the whole book is metaphorical. A very good read if you're in the &quot;whats the meaning of life?&quot; stage. It won't give any answers, but it helps you ask the right questions. -:)"},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"This book is great but only for what it is!It is a stepping-stone book into heaving spiritual teachings out there. However it is a great first step.I recommend this as excellent inspiration for those people who are struggling with their mundane existences and know there is something more out there but can't put there finger on it.As stated it should be considered as introductory, and inspirational, reading and on that basis is a must-read for the person looking to break out of his or her current paradigm."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"This is for reveiwer (rattemause) who ranted that he/she did not and could not find the time to try some of recommendation in this book? And yet has the time to submitt a total of 200 reviews to amamzon.com (&quot;We always find time and have enough time, for the things, that we put first.&quot;)"},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"So here's my experience with the book: I first purchased this book when I was 15. And to tell you the truth I don't recall why. And I read it in one sitting. I came away from the reading with a sense of &quot;Wow, that's really amazing. That was a really cool book.&quot; However I did NOT feel that the book lived up to it's subtitle &quot;The Book that Changes Lives&quot; In fact I thought it was a practice in pretension to label it as Millman did. And I put the book away and forgot about it...(dramatic pause)... or so I thought (BUM BUM BUM). You see it wasn't until I was 17 or so that I began to realize that the book had made a grand impact on my life. I realized that I was seeing the world in a completely different way... that I was learning to &quot;let things go&quot; to have fewer expectations from life and enjoying more what life was giving me. And through practice (which probably will continue for the rest of my life, these changes have continued and refined themselves in the years following this revelation. Of course a portion of these changes are due to me simply maturing and evolving as a person from age 15 to present. The book however set me on the right path for who I am and who I am to become as time goes on. My path may be differnt than yours- and I think that's the point and the reason that the reviews on this site are either very high or very low. For some this book resonates on a deep level and for others they see only the words. This is not to put value judgements on &quot;getting it&quot; or &quot;not getting it&quot;. This bok is only one of the paths that leads to wherever it is that we are all headed as humanity. Each of us, (if i may be allowed a new age moment), is a person &quot;becoming&quot; and at different rates. It is not a question of is this book is right or wrong, it is a question of whether this book is right or wrong for whom. In this case that &quot;whom&quot; is you... and there is only one way to find out and that is to read it for yourself."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"This book is not new material. I wouldn't say it is groundbreaking or that it changed my life. Probably because I am already acquainted with the principles of Buddhism and Eastern thinking. So I didn't find anything new here that would give me a \\"wow\\" factor like all the other reviews claim. What I did find is that it presents the ideology in a down-to-earth, real-life format, thus making it easy for one to understand how to apply the principles to one's own life. The character of Socrates, the teacher, is lovable and so well done that you really feel he's there with you. The storyline is well put together. Parts of it were taken from the author's own life and some were created, but they are seamlessly intertwined. The story flows and the book is a quick read. Millman also incorporates Plato's allegory of the cave and some zen koans within the plot to help enlighten you on some of the points that are presented. I already knew about Plato's allegory and some of the zen koans from before, they are classics, so they were not new to me but I did enjoy seeing how they were applied to the main storyline.And now for the criticism. There were two things I didn't like about this book.1. How little time or explanation Millman incorporates about his failed marriage and daughter. It just seems like a hiccup in his life. And that is why I believe Zen can only take you so far. I believe there is more to life than just letting everything go. What about forming relationships? What about atoning for your actions? If you hurt someone, it is not enough for you to realize it and let it go, you have to take action. At least seek forgiveness, let the person know you made a mistake and that you are sorry. Zen just seems to put you in a bubble and the truth is, we all are not solitary monks. We constantly interact with people, which brings me to point #2.2. The author tries to breeze through the subject of altruism by making a couple of statements here and there. Apparently, learning to be a happy person by not wanting anything makes you care for others. I didn't buy it. The author doesn't really explain or give examples as to how achieving enlightenment will make you care for others. As a matter of fact, he even relates an anecdote in which he got upset when a homeless man asked him for money. He justifies his reaction buy just saying that all one has to do is just let it go. What about realizing that the anger was a result of the guilt of not giving the man any money? Again, the problem with Zen. It's great for learning how to be happy if you live in a bubble, but it doesn't give you guidelines on how your relationship to others should be. It only focuses on the self. That's kinda selfish when you think about it. There has to be more to life than just attaining your own enlightenment. What about putting that enlightenment into action by helping others and being a compassionate person?Overall, this is a good quick read. It might be beneficial for unenlightened souls. But for those who are already on the path, it's nothing to rave about."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I cannot give any book that gives useful life messages less than five stars, because I don't want to discourage anyone from reading it, however, the story in this book can drag at times. Although, the messages that it contains are necessary for the journey of the soul and it is definitely on my list of must reads. What I personally got out of the book is the importance of living in the NOW, not the past or future. What am I doing with myself right now? If you ask yourself this question often, you will find yourself being more productive. There are plenty of wonderful and inspiring passages in this book that will change your life, for example, &quot;There are no accidents, everything has a purpose.&quot; Another key message from the warrior may be: Don't ever think you have learned enough - or life will throw you some hard lessons. Just when you think the character understands something, he gets thrown a hardball, similar to the course of life. At times you feel sorry for him, but he can be so cocky! Learning to be humble is one of life's greatest lessons as well."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"For my independent book project I read the book Way of the Peaceful Warrior, by DanMillman. Set in Berkeley California, a young college student, Dan Millman, struggles to find thepart of himself that has always been missing. One night while out walking from his dorm, Dancomes across a gas station and a strange man that is soon to turn his life upside down. This man,known as Socrates, shows Dan a side of existence that only few people had ever seen. Tobecome a warrior like Socrates and have the mind to not allow the regular struggles of life tocontrol a single part of you. Socrates takes Dan in and tries to create a warrior from a young starathlete with the ignorance of every other human on this earth. Through his teachings Dan comesacross an elusive women named Joy. This spiritual journey shows Dan a side of life never seen byhis own eyes before, and guides him to his final conflict that hopefully will help him reach hisdestination he has always yearned for. The missing piece of the puzzle that is Dan Millman.This book shows life in a way you may have never thought of before. It shows the manysteps it takes to become, \\"a warrior.\\" The biggest strength of this book is the way these steps areportrayed. In most cases it is Socrates showing the ignorant Dan the differences between theirlives. Socrates shows Dan how a warrior looks at several simple aspects of life unlike the normalhuman. In one section, Socrates shows Dan the difference between the brain and the mind. Danquestions the positive uses for the mind and the great minds in history. Socrates shows him thatthere aren't any great minds, that there are only great brains. \\"Mind is one of those slippery termslike love. The proper definition relates to your level of consciousness.\\" Socrates states andcontinues to explain how the brain has abstract processes of dealing with information called, \\"theintellect.\\" He adds, \\"Nowhere have I mentioned mind. The brain and mind are not the same.The brain is real; the mind isn't.\\" He later explains how the mind is all the random uncontrolledthoughts that cloud your brain, and how the mind is a useless tool. This way of separating thesetwo simples words allows the reader to think about what the book is saying, and to figure out ifthere is truth to what the book says.Another strength of this book, is obviously the way it makes you think about the steps itshows. The difference between the mind and brain is not something most think about in theirregular lives. But as I read each word I found truth to what Socrates was saying. You read thisbook and try to realize the hidden messages being put across. The message between the mind andbrain is to not let your brain be attacked by random useless thoughts. In other words, to not letyour, \`mind', get in the way of your brain. People think millions of useless thoughts each day.Without these thoughts a persons brain would be clear and their emotions would be easier tocontrol. Dan tries to explain to Socrates that he will control his \`mind' and change himself in theprocess. \\"That is one of your biggest illusions. You've been willing to change clothes, hairstyles,women, apartment, and jobs. You are willing to change anything, except yourself.\\" Socratesstates. This again enables the reader to reflect on their life and brain. And to put themselves inthe shoes of the main character Dan.This book allows you to relate to the main character. The main character is a young manwho has been set to see the world the way most have. He is ignorant when it comes to seeing theother side of the picture. Readers can relate to him because they share a lot of the same qualitiesand ignorance. As Socrates teaches Dan about the mind, he also teaches the reader. As I readthis book I found myself thinking the same questions as Dan asked in the book. It made merealize how little most humans know and how unwelcome they are to change.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It allowed me to relate to the main character, reflect onmy life, and try to change myself in the process of reading it. I was able to see the parts of my lifethat had not been even fathomed before. Through Dan's journey I was able to see the part ofmyself that I had been missing. This book is not a challenging book and allows for every readerto have their own interpretation of it. It is sad for me to say but this book definitely affected mylife and made me see the parts of myself that were in need of change. I recommend this book foranyone struggling to find them self like most humans are, or anyone in general who would like toread something that causes them to live through the motions of the main character. This bookcreates a world similar to ours where, though he is not real, there is a \`Socrates' in each in everyperson's life. I recommend it to anyone, and later in life I will read it again to see my growth andthe things in my life I have left to change.By,ClaytonMaderia"},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"Dan Millman's book, The Way of the Peaceful Warrior, is an amazing journey of self-discovery and enlightenment. It was a very fluid read and an eye-opening experience. The author unveils that the way to Happiness is by being present along the journey. Every step of the journey is important. There are no ordinary moments. There is in actuality no hierarchy, just the illusion based on our preference. So our college graduation is not intrinsically better than the last day of vacation or garbage recycling day or even this very moment. It all matters, because \\"the Essence of Aliveness matters; the details do not.\\"Beneath all circumstances, thoughts & emotions lies \\"the innate perfection of one's life unfolding. That is the secret of unreasonable happiness.\\"Another book I love that delves into the magic available in each moment as it unfolds is Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment. Authors Ariel and Shaya Kane explain that if you trade in your preferences for the willingness to be in each moment as it actually is, you will be rewarded with extraordinary well-being. Since reading these works I have had many examples of \\"unreasonable happiness\\" in my own life.A recent 6+ hour wait in an airport in Costa Rica, which ended with a cancelled flight and an unexpected overnight stay, became a delightful adventure and an opportunity to set aside my preferences and have well-being. One had only to look at the faces of other passengers to see that this was not the common response to the situation. But as I have begun to engage in each moment, without prejudice, my life has opened up to unexpected sources of actual joy & well-being."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"A friend recommended this book to me and it changed my life.This is a well written, easily read book of personal growth. Initially I set out reading the book as a story and soon found that I became a part of it, living and feeling the story as it unfolded. I now own a well thumbed paper back copy.Dan, the author and world class athlete tells his own story of spiritual growth as he meets the challenges of life helped by the sometimes obtuse council of his mentor. It's a book which once you pick it up, even on the third or fourth read you just don't want to put it down and each time you read it new gems of wisdom will become apparent in the writing. We each have our own vision and purpose in life, just remember - &quot;there are no ordinary moments&quot;"},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I enjoyed reading Dan Millman's book very much because through a fun and engaging character he exposes the reader to universal teachings. I found myself turning the pages to learn more and also found myself in many of them. I learned that one can train how to be unreasonably happy and is the ultimate goal of the spiritual warrior who discovers its true nature. I found reading this book a very simple way of accessing my inner peace and finding humor in my life as well. Millman opened my eyes to what a miracle life is and his book has found a permanent place on my bookshelf.In a similar way, Ariel and Shya Kane's book How To Create a Magical Relationship has eye opening, enlightening stories. By way of their transformation principles they give us a new perspective on relationships, including the one we have with ourselves. The Kanes have a very practical approach that can be used in everyday situations, in which life gets light, fun and magical. I highly recommend them. Their books are pearls of wisdom."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I enjoyed going on the journey with Dan Millman in \\"The Way of the Peaceful Warrior\\".It opened my eyes and reminded me of a possibility that exists for us all.After \\"accidentally\\" meeting his enlightened teacher, Socrates, at an all night gas station, Dan embarks on an amazing voyage that leads to his discovery of a gentle yet profound state of being where there are no ordinary moments.Dan had been an unsatisfied striver, doer, competitor ( world class athelete) and complainer before his world was shaken up by this extraordinary man.In most cultures, we humans are conditioned to strive for the future, have regrets about the past & for the most part, blame circumstances outside ourselves for what is happening in our lives. Getting caught up with this \\"way of being\\" has become a lifestyle that's robbing us of the magic, the intimacy and the intensity of the current, perfect, moment of now - and, as Dan found out, the place where satisfaction truly lives.\\"How to Create a magical Relationship\\", by Ariel and Shya Kane, is another book that gently nudged me into exploring the magical realm of living in the present moment. It's a series of short stories where people's lives instantaneously transform while speaking with the Kanes. I got so much value after reading these two books!"},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"This book is truly inspiring, mind-opening and will change the way you look at life forever. It shows you the great possibilities that are in store for every human being. In this respect I find this book extremely powerful and helpful.There is one thing, however, that I find to be disturbing. The story is based on fiction as well as fantasy. This fact wouldn't be bad by itself, however, the reader gets the impression that this book is a sincere autobiography - which it is not. Thus, while appreciating the fantastic story, we should not take the story itself for real. We may, however, learn from the lessons it contains."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior is the entertaining and inspirational story of one man's quest for spiritual truth. The man, Dan Millman, while in college encounters a sage of sorts at a gas station. They strike up a conversation and the next thing you know Dan has been taken under this man's wing as his student. Dan calls the teacher Socrates and from the point of their first encounter Dan's life would never be the same.During the book Socrates imparts many wise lessons to Dan. Some of these lessons are; be present in the here and now, avoid unhealthy attachment to things, recognize the potential of the mind to mislead, and realize the utmost importance of paradox, humor and change in life. These lessons are very similar to Eastern wisdom, namely Buddhism. If you are a follower of any of the Eastern disciplines these admonishments won't come as a surprise but they are great reminders for all of us.This book isn't written that well but it's great for other reasons. One of the main ones is that it's not just a boring guidebook teaching you how to achieve \\"enlightenment\\". It's an entertaining blend of biography and fiction that keeps you interested in the outcome. Also, it does a great job of covering a wide area that can really alter someone's life for the better once they start implementing the advices contained within the book.There is talk that a movie is coming out based on this book with Nick Nolte playing the role of the teacher Socrates. It's hard to imagine a movie portraying the deep wisdom found in this book but the jury will have to be out till we are able to watch for ourselves. Nevertheless, pick this book up and prepare to be motivated and desired to live in a more meaningful and peaceful way."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I got to know the character Socrates over a dozen years ago, when an oddball friend of mine lent me his copy of The Way of the Peaceful Warrior. At the time, I was a gung ho entrepreneur with no interest in spirituality. Socrates' teachings, such as \\"all your answers lie within,\\" \\"there are no accidents,\\" and, my favorite, \\"we all make our own sandwiches,\\" coincided with a series of cataclysmic events that completely uprooted my belief system.Once I realized that reality was nothing like I had been led to believe, I began studying various spiritual disciplines. I thank Socrates for contributing to my transformation.-Edwin Harkness Spina, author of the award-winning, visionary thriller Mystic Warrior"},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I was eleven when I first read this amazing book. Out of boredom while waiting for my dad in the truck, I picked it up off the seat. immediatle I was transfixed. I couldn't put it down. After turning the final page and reading the last words in this tremendous book, I felt that I was a different person. It gave me a whole new outlook on life. I was only sad that I was done reading it. Since then I've read it twice and nomatter how many times I read it it sems I've learned something new!"},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"While this book might be really valuable to some... particularly young men perhaps... it may be dissapointing to other, more sophisticated readers. As it is based only loosely on real-life experiences, I found the authentic segments about Millman's inner emotional life to begin to move me, but was distracted and even annoyed by the plainly fictionalized passages and events, particularly the supernatural feats of Socrates. To feel that a wise mentor needs to be enhanced with magic powers is to gild the lily. The more I was touched by Millman's growth and his relationship with Socrates, the more I wanted to know the true story and the true Socrates. I was convinced that Millman had a profound learning experience, and I felt 'ripped off' by the fact that he didn't share that true experience, but instead offered only his often overdone, enhanced retelling.But for a young audience it may be a great antidote to the kind of materialism, ambition, and emotional armoring that society encourages, especially in men. And it is also a decent introduction to some eastern thought, retold in a language accessible to a youthful american readership.Marketed to a youth audience, I might give it 4 stars, but I think that complete honesty and authenticity are too important a part of growth, healing and spirituality to recommend this book over all the other possible titles in the genre."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I have read several \\"self-help\\" books, and the advice in almost all of them is to focus on what you want to get. This book is a welcome divurging from that incorrect(and depressing) outlook on life. If you spend all of your time focusing on the home you \\"will have\\" in 10 years or that dream job/car or whatever it may be for you(and this is exactly what \\"The Secret\\" suggests you do) you will not be able to enjoy the moment you are in. And heaven forbid it does not pan out because then you may not even have a few moments of happiness. The philosophy in this book is one of making the most of every moment, never taking anything for grated, enjoying what you have and doing your best now."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"For me, the book is full of wisdom, of challenge, & insight for living in the here and now in a mindfull way. I was challenged to empty my cup (partially succeeded) of my preconceptions, ideas and belief systems to be able to take in what I saw as stretches for me and ah-ha points that help me along.Is the book for everyone? Maybe. Maybe not. That depends on the readers want, need and openess."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"This book had me enthralled from the beginning. As soon as I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. I ended up reading the whole thing in less then twenty four hours. Some very valuable lessons to be learned here. This is a must read for anyone that has the time. Even if you don't have the time, make some for this book!"},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"How far would you go to reach unreasonable happiness? Would you set your whole life aside for a man the promises you a life time of happiness, before you even know who the man is? In this book a student named Dan, puts his college and carrier to a sudden stop when he meets a man named Socrates. He tells Dan that he knows the path to finding unreasonable happiness, and Dan is willing to find that path.Way of the Peaceful Warrior is a funny book, and very good book. It shows you while reading the book, how you can live your life and reach happiness on another level, then just laughing all day. It shows how you can in joy life, to the littlest detail. The best part in the book I would have to say is when Dan pushes past his mentally expectations and pushes his body to it's limits, breaking past his blocked mind from seeing, life to its fullest.This mind is the one thing that holds back yourself and the body from reaching great height. The constant thoughts that pass through your head, the talking that you do to yourself, and telling yourself that you can't do anything. It's like a poison that holds you down from accomplishing anything. The mind is a limitation to our body and our spirits. I think that this is the message that Dan Millman was trying to send to his readers, that when u move passed the mind, you can live life to its fullest.The book is a great book, one of the best I have read. It was hard for me to put it down, and thoughts were always racing through my head of what was going to happen next, and why something happened the way it did. I recommend this book to who ever would want to read it."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I first read \\"Way of the Peaceful Warrior\\" well over twenty years ago, but since I recently saw the movie based on the book, I decided to reread it. What Dan Millman has succeeded in doing so well is taking a core set of profound and eternal \\"truths,\\" many of which are inspired by Buddhist and zen thought, and popularizing them through an intriguing and enigmatic figure referred to throughout the story as \\"Socrates.\\" Now just who is Socrates in reality? Well, I believe that Socrates is probably a fictionalized composite of several people and inspirational writings that Dan Millman himself had the good fortune of encountering during a certain period of his youth. Perhaps some will see Socrates as an aspect of Millman's higher self, or perhaps as some type of dream guide, etc.. But it really doesn't matter after all. The important thing here is that I am quite certain that many people have read and enjoyed this book who might otherwise never pick up a book on zen or Buddhism or any of the other strains of eastern or so-called new-age thought. I had the privilege of meeting Dan Millman about a dozen years ago. He is a very unassuming and down-to-earth man. I believe this is a classic tale that will endure the test of time long after most of the \\"new-age\\" literature has gone by the wayside. At any rate, if you have the slightest interest in this book but have never read it, do yourself a favor and pick up a copy. If you read it some time ago, but only once, read it again. It's definitely worth another go-around. For what it's worth, do not be dissuaded from seeing the movie (\\"Peaceful Warrior\\" starring Nick Nolte as \\"Socrates\\") because of the negative reviews by some film critics. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and thought it captured the essence of the book exceedingly well."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"It was the summer of 1991, and I found myself in the depths of despair. I turned to a small self-help bookstore for help, and soon came across Dan Millman's Way of the Peaceful Warrior. It was a book that touched me intimately and deeply, and empowered me to take a giant step in my own spiritual growth. Now, I run a wellness center and am a self-help author myself, sharing, much like Dan does, my own story of the spiritual triumph in The Spirit of Joy. I am always grateful for Dan's book, and refer back to it with fondness, as it helped opened doors that I had left closed in my life for far too long."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I have always loved this book.

The thoughts presented by the author have been clearly borrowed from Eastern culture and you see a \\"cocktail\\" version. Yet the world is full of different people and someone or the other will purchase this book and make their own judgements. To conclude, the book is fake concotion and not nearly original. The author tries to be a spirtual leader but fails."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"This is the worst book I could send to someone if I wanted them to &quot;change their life&quot;. I read this because an ex-girlfriend recommended it to me and it is truly awful. There is no real story, there is no real plot, its an empty book that is a total waste of time, extolling the virtues of altruism and mysticism.As a matter of fact, if you truly want to read a book that will change your life without being so lame I suggest anything by Alexandre Dumas, Ayn Rand or Nathaniel Branden.Wait a minute!

I know, he says the old man is real, but so what? Just because you knew an old man doesn't make the story you make up any better. I knew a janitor that would talk about life, but I didn't make up a goofy story about him flying around on a mop!!!It occured to me when I got to the part about him flying around the universe and then BECOMING the universe that this really sounded like an acid trip - not very inspiring. And what was the point about the old man jumping on and off the roof? He doesn't even explain why he made that part up!!!This book is poorly written, totally made up, goofy, pointless and totally worthless.I really don't want to sound negative about this book, but I feel totally ripped off.

This book really should not even be offered by Amazon. This book is an infamous tool used by people who are into S&M to destroy their victims' free will. Reading this book is boring at best; but dangerous at worst. The protagonist IS a willing slave to Socrates...who uses physical abuse and mind control in order to destroy Dan's ability to think for himself.

I approached the book with mixed emotions, hoping to find something worthwhile and poignant, but at the same time skeptical of its &quot;New Age&quot; undertones. I was completely, totally, pleasantly surprised. Instead of rambling on for pages with pseudoscience I found a refreshingly upbeat and spiritual worldview that did not try to dethrone modern empirical thought. It did not speak of some ambiguous, omnipresent yet hidden God or Father or Babysitter, nor did it appeal exclusively to humanity's desire for something loftier than human existence. In fact, the only thing it really seemed to say, though the book expressed this in a wonderfully laid out parable, is that nothing is so real or so important as to last forever. &quot;Lighten up,&quot; is basically the moral of this story. And when compared to current popular works of philosophy/fiction such as the abhorrent Celestine Prophecy, which are rife with New Age psychobable and faulty logic, The Way of the Peaceful Warior is a pleasant change of pace. As an added bonus, the story, while a bit choppy at times, is actually quite good as fiction goes."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"THIS BOOK WAS INCREDIBLE!

And yet, even those with the most expansive reading lists rarely come upon a book that truly changes their lives. For me, at least, this book was one such gem among the millions. I sat down one Saturday afternoon, intending to read only the first chapter. I put the book down about four hours later in a state of wonder and awe, alive with the confidence that I could positively alter my life. What I found was that this book solidified a lot of what I had been thinking about for several years. After reading this, I felt like everything made perfect sense. I felt like I could gain the strength to meet the world on the level that I wanted to. And I still do. This book was an inspiration for me to begin to change my life in wonderful ways. Several months later, and after having read another of Mr. Millman's books, &quot;No Ordinary Moments,&quot; I have begun to bring myself out of my self-destructive habits. I have stopped biting my fingernails; I am no longer addicted to Coca-Cola or related products; I am more in touch with and more capable of expressing my emotions. Most important of all, however, is this: for the first time since about eight years ago, I am beginning to have a positive self-image. This may not sound like anything particularly wonderful, but this book and its author have the power to change lives, and the fact remains: my life IS changing. Regardless of who you are, I recommend reading this book. Even if it doesn't bring your world into perspective or make you effect change in your life, it will at least give you another interesting view of the world, one with which it is well worth your while to be familiar. Even if it doesn't change your outlook on life, it is a wonderful and uplifting story. For anyone on any spiritual journey, or anyone that wishes to realize the potential of their life, this is a worthwhile read. I cannot think of a book that I would recommend more highly"},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"This book is an AMAZING story that changes the life of all who read it. After seeing life with the eyes of Dan Millman you will never see life the same again. Reading this book is like looking into a pool of blue water. Every thing that life has been trying to tell you, if you look at it in the light, it is very clear. There is no way around this being a GREAT book. I would not go a day more not knowing what I have learned about MYSELF within this book. The Way of the Peaceful Warrior sets you on your own journey in finding your personal meaning in life. I highly recomend this to all who seek a higer purpose in life or all who just want to read a good story!"},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"Millman, or at least his publishing company try to portray him as the intellectual equal of Socrates, or perhaps Plato. Sadly, all he does is re-hash \\"Bubblegum Zen\\" philosophy, advocate vegetarianism and equate gymnastics with some deep meditative process. Worse, he does it with little sense of writing style, numerous factual errors, and a creepy relationship between him and an underage girl named Joy.One would expect a warrior, even a peaceful one, to show qualities like courage, stoicism, honor, loyalty, and so forth. Millman's self-portrayal is a whining, self-pitying, individual who shows absolutely no loyalty to his first wife (the most likable character in the book) and daughter. Particularly saddening is that his daughter is little more than a footnote, the reader never gets to feel any parental emotion from Millman.Millman also is not so much an actor as something that is acted upon by outside forces. He has no apparent free will. His early ennui is caused by society, his enlightenment is caused by Socrates, his misery is caused by his wife, his happiness by Joy. He even blames her for leading him on about her age. I really don't understand how Millman could not have guessed that this girl for whom he was pining was not of age. He doesn't come across as dumb. His willingness to give in to every one of Socrates' demands too is a little bothersome, didn't the Heaven's Gate, Branch Davidian and Jonestown folks think their leaders were deeply enlightened? Think before you obey.The best thing about this book is that it is an easy read, and most philosophy books do read like bad VCR instructions. However, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, the Tao of Pooh and the Te of Piglet, are just as easy to read, a lot more fun, and have better messages. For that matter, Everything I Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten is also an easy to read book that changes lives.Some of you love this book, and that is really great, but please don't let this be an end to any search for enlightenment, after all there are five major world religions, dozens of minor ones, and dozens of schools of philosophy to explore. This book is a dip in a kiddy pool, let's try for the deep end."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"There are some tidbits of wisdom to be gained here, but I take issue with Millman's lack of Love or simple human Compassion in this story. Typically, in the mentor/student relationship there is plenty of room for an impatient sage shaking some sense into an egotistical student. The problem is that Socrates takes this to the extreme, constantly belittling his student through almost 180 pages, almost eroding his own credibility in the process. While we want to learn that Death is not necessarily a finality of our existance, I cannot understand the model of a mentor who purposely brings Death to his student as part of a lesson plan. It's too cynical of a philosophy for me to comprehend. After all, isn't Socrates trying to teach Millman how to LIVE? Maybe Humor, Paradox, and Change are the key elements of life for Socrates and Millman, but I have to believe that Love has to exist somewhere in the mix too. After all, isn't Millman seeking this too? Lastly, Millman abandons his progeny to take a fanciful journey around the world instead of taking care of his responsibilities. Millman dismisses his own child in favor of selfish pursuits. What kind of \\"Warrior\\" would do this? I was rather shocked."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"Wonderful, inspirational work!

But it is not a bad book per say. The ideas expressed in book are in general true, though highly exaggerated, it is written for a simple audience with 7th grade reading skills. The event in the book are forced and generally unbelievable and uninteresting.The \\"wisdom\\" taught seems to come out of nowhere. Don't expect an Aristotilian logical methodology here, the author doesn't feel like using reason to make his point, his magical characters just \\"know\\" somehow. And often contradict themselves; there is a point where the realization is made that happiness can only be achieved by simply being \\"happy\\" not doing anything or thriving, the passive state of happiness and enjoying the grass growing. If that is such a good way of living, why is Mr. Millman, the author of the book publishing books and holding lectures? Why not just sit on a hill and enjoy the beauty that is nature until starvation or death \\"reunites\\" him with the eternal cycle? I mean why wait?

Believe it! Dan Millman, a gymnastics student at the University of California, Berkeley, finds himself at a crucial point in his life, poised on the verge of manhood, and at the jumping off point of his own success. But somehow his life feels flat and empty. Without real meaning. That's when he meets Socrates at a gas station one day. The meeting is seemingly random, and Dan thinks that Socrates might not be playing with all of his marbles in the bag. He soon learns differently. &quot;When you are ready, a teacher will be presented to you.&quot; This is one of the first lessons that Dan learns from Socrates, and only one of many. His initial impression of Socrates is changed forever when he realizes that Socrates is the answer to all of the questions in Dans life...or rather, Dan finds out that he had all of the answers all along, just like Dorothy in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. I owned a total of 14 copies of this book since it was published, and found that I couldn't hold on to even one of them. They were all given to friends who I knew would benefit from the parables and life lessons that Dan learns. I met Dan Millman a few years later, and found that he wholeheartedly believes every word in that book, and that first book was the impetus for all of the following &quot;help&quot; books that he later wrote. Don't pass up a chance to read this...it just might change your life!"},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"This is a guide-book in one of all ways to live your life and feel good about it. After I read it, it didn't take long before I started to enjoy every moment in life in a way I hadn't before. I didn't at once realize that it was my way of seing things that made me feel better. I thougt it was my new job or my wonderful girlfriend or our new house we'd just moved into...but it wasn't! Later it hit me that these kind of changings wasn't new to me. I'd been through bigger and more powerful things before without feeling any better. It was my way of SEING my life as an &quot;All Time Happening&quot; with no moment like the moment before. Sometimes I feel afraid of what is going to happen if I lose my way of &quot;seing&quot;, my &quot;strength&quot;, my way to guide myself through hard moments in my daily life, but for each time I get this worried it takes less time to get my personal &quot;strength&quot; back. If anyone would have told me 10 years ago that I, with all my heart and with love all around, should be leading projects and managing complex computer-networks I hadn't believed them...but my way of taking care of &quot;The everyday enlightments&quot; ...I don't know what to say...it really works, thats all! Sometimes I'd like to send my thanks to Soc, Mama Chia and Dan(the character) but I know that it is not important. What's important is to share this wonderful way of seeing to others, so they can start to live their life in their own way. I mean, this is not a school of how to live. It's a school of: HOW TO FIND YOUR OWN WAY OF TAKING CARE OF EVERY MOMENT IN YOUR LIFE, EVERYDAY! There isn't any &quot;The only way&quot;.

He died at 38, and I had such horrible pain when his parents asked me what to put on his tombstone. Nothing I could think of was adequate to express how much I loved him, how beautiful and brilliant he was, how passionate, and brave, how kind. No words could portray a man I remember as colors and sounds and passions. Then I remembered his favorite book. On his stone now, it says &quot;Peaceful Warrior.&quot; And it is perfect."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend as \\"a truly inspiring\\" story. The story lacks cohesion or continuity. As an example, the narrator is walking down the street, sees the \\"teaching character\\" (you could call him a guru or a spiritual leader if you want) do something \\"inexplicable\\". In order to get an explanation, the main character goes into the teacher's place of business and starts asking \\"How did you do that?\\" and then walks into the teacher's back office and sits down. The characters in the story react to this as if these actions are completely normal. This story takes place in Berkeley, CA, not exactly a place where walking into a stranger's back office is normal (or allowed).I have read half of the book so far. There are many instances of lucid dreaming or some sort of astral projection. As this is a \\"spiritual\\" book, the subject matter did not bother me. What did bother me was the lack of a set up for every single scene. Events happen with little or no explanation. The narration flits around emotions without any reason of why he went from happy to sad in the blink of an eye.This book basically reads like the ramblings of a narcotics addict. Some people may derive inspirational feelings from this. I got a headache and a large amount of disappointment."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"I must admit, as I was reading this book, I radically changed my mind about what I wanted to write in this review. I went though a veritable roller-coaster of emotions; I hated it, I liked it, I loved it. By the end, I could almost guarantee that anyone reading this book will have a strong opinion on it.I know that this book finds it's way into the 'self-help' section of many bookstores, but I really hesitate to place it in that category, as it's not a how-to; the book doesn't explicitly state \\"do this and you will feel better\\", but rather it presents the reader with a narration of the author's life, after which it is up to the reader to decide what they want to take away from it.Dan's recount of his tales was really captivating. As I was reading it, I felt myself really associating with him and understanding the feelings he went through in his time with Socrates. At various points in the book, Millman recounts these short tales that almost read like fables. I would often stop and just try to extrapolate the morals behind these tales before going on to read what Millman had to say about them.Probably one of the most impressive things about this book is its emphasis on the value of hard work. Millman doesn't just experience a single event with Socrates: he embarks on a journey, a process that takes a great deal of time and effort to help transform him, to help him learn. At the beginning of the book, I had this great fear that the book would present Socrates as this 'silver bullet', this one magical fix for Dan's life, and so I was really pleased to see that that wasn't the case.Although I truly appreciate the message that Millman was trying to get across with his book, I have to admit that there were some things about it that put me off. First off, Millman's 'embellishments' in his story-telling were too much to take at times. While they may spice up the plot, I think it clouds some of the points the book is trying to get across. Reality is reality, fantasy is fantasy, and with a subject like this, getting the two confused can be dangerous.Another sticking point with me were some of the values that Socrates deemed unimportant and those he deemed invaluable. The care-free attitude that he and his friend Joseph embodied may work for them, but it forgets the responsibility that many people in this world have. A key example of this is parents: if their children make them unhappy, they can't just up and leave them. If they don't like their job, they can't just quit it if they don't have another one.At one point in the book, Socrates made a comment criticizing moderation, saying that it was only something for the bland, apologetic, and fence-sitters of the world. I feel Socrates is making a mistake here by confusing moderation with indecision. I don't think there's anything inherently wrong or harmful with being patient and making good, calculated decisions instead of foolish, impulsive ones.I do honestly believe this is a good work by Millman, and one that just about everyone reading it can get something out of. However, I would encourage people to take it with a grain of salt, and to really decide for themselves whether or not what they got out of the book applies to their own life."},{"Title":"Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives","review":"Dan Millman's \\"Way of the Peaceful Warrior\\" is a wonderful adventure! It's a fun story, as the main character, \\"Dan\\", meets an enlightened teacher, Socrates, who shares insight on living life with ease, and free from the limiting thoughts of the mind. It's an engaging story line as Dan's world shifts from the ordinary to the extraordinary. I love how Dan Millman has created a novel that teaches with enlightening wisdom.As Dan Millman's character, Socrates, shares stories and jewels of wisdom that helped Dan find new meaning in his life, I have found that Ariel and Shya Kanes' books have done the same for me. Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment, How To Create a Magical Relationship and Working on Yourself Doesn't Work: A Book About Instantaneous Transformation are three books that teach a practical approach on how to live life in moment.

Its an inspirational book that left me wondering what to make of the story, and which aspects of it were fictional and which were fantasy.In the end, it emphasized some very important life lessons for a conscious spiritual path - lessons that are not unlike those offered in most books of this nature on the market today. The story is intriguing, but no deep revelations are offered up by this work. I would therefore prefer to give it 3 1/2 stars instead of the 4 that I have given to it. However, I believe that it is better than a 3-star rating although barely making it to 4 stars. Hence, my decision to rate it four stars.An earlier reviewer described this as Millman's best work. I hope not, because I am sufficiently motivated by this book to read some of his other books - I would not want them to be any less inspirational than this one."},{"Title":"The Greatest Dog Stories Ever Told","review":"Almost every story in this book is good. Some are funny, some are poignant, some are adventures set in different eras or cultures, and some are interesting in other ways. Only the bizarre tale by Ray Bradbury is really not even about something recognizable as a dog and in my view might better have been omitted from the collection.Many of the stories are extracts from books or longer works of some sort, and the references to the sources are here so you can follow up by reading the rest of the story if you want.I found Jack Alan's to be the funniest one (and you'd be hard pressed to find it elsewhere as the book it's from was published in 1944). Rudyard Kipling's was the most poignant. The selection from Gary Paulsen'sWinterdance: The Fine Madness of Running the Iditarodwas good as a short introduction to another book worth reading, as were several of the stories.The story another reviewer complains about is by Mark Twain. It is not a happy tale, but not every story has to be a happy one. This one is told from the dog's viewpoint and in that respect especially it is uniquely well done, and, as is typical for Twain, is true-to-life and has its funny moments too."},{"Title":"The Greatest Dog Stories Ever Told","review":"great book. buy it you won't be disappointed!

Initially it answered many of my nagging doubts regarding modern evangelicalism. It also fired me up and got me really excited about following the Bible and the words of Jesus literally. If you know nothing about Anabaptists, Amish or Mennonites then this book is for you. Well worth the few quid you spend on it. It's a great book. the book that kind of clinched it for me really in my decision to become Amish-Mennonite. though when I got there I found modern day Anabaptism is not what I thought it was or what historical Anabaptism was.I went the way of so many. Looking for the perfect Church according to my own set of standards of what perfect is. Like so many I didn't find it. Many end up leaving the Church and just heading out on their own with their family. Others try to recreate the Church and end up like the groups they despise.I tried a different route. Find the Church of the first century, locate it on earth today. Join it, and submit myself to it. What I found wasn't necessarily what I was comfortable with, but it is the Church that Jesus established through His Apostles, sinners and all! The Orthodox Church doesn't have the prettiest history, but neither does ancient Judaism, yet Jesus said the people of his day regarding the pharisees, and I paraphrase \\"do what they say, but don't do what they do, for they sit in the seat of Moses.\\" Now if he could say that about the hypocritical pharisees, how much more the successors of the Apostles, the men who sit in their seats? And there are plenty of righteous men in the Orthodox Church, past and present.Schism is a great sin, numbered right up there with adultery and murder. The Anabaptist Church is infamous for it's history of schism. If you are searching for the truth, I encourage you to consider Orthodoxy. A good book to start with is eitherThe Way: What Every Protestant Should Know about the Orthodox ChurchorBecoming Orthodox: A Journey to the Ancient Christian Faith."},{"Title":"The commentaries of AL: Being The Equinox, vol. V, no. 1","review":"By the time he'd gotten around to rewriting the Master Therion's commentaries, Mr. Motta was appearantly convinced that he had somehow become Crowley's incarnation. This was unfortunate, and his works suffer for it. Motta muddles the \\"Old\\" and \\"New\\" Comments, and then inserts his own as well, without enough differentiation between the three, and which is attributable to whom. It is certainly *not* worth the astronomically high prices currently being asked for-- you'll be making a fool's investment for a $1000 copy of Motta's Equinox Vol V, No. 1.A somewhat better and much more collectable edition of the Old and New commentaries on the Book of the Law was published in 1973, entitledMagical and philosophical commentaries on The book of the law, and was published by 93 Publications, Canada. A copy of that, if you can find it, will run you over $500.00. However, although it has more typographical errors than Isreal Regardie'sThe Law is for Alledit, it is also less heavy-handed in the editing.Good news for non-bibliophiles: the newest paperback version currently in print, entitledThe Law Is for All: The Authorized Popular Commentary of Liber Al Vel Legis Sub Figura Ccxx, the Book of the Lawis the original Louis Wilkinson edit of the Old and New Commentaries as supervised by Aleister Crowley before his death. This edit is admittedly a bit tighter than Regardie's. This Wilkinson edit, footnoted and appendiced by Hymenaeus Beta seems likely to remain be the 'ultimate' version for the forseeable future.Frankly, I'm glad to see the current edition in print, and as well-done as it has been; Hymenaeus Beta and the O.T.O. are going to great lengths to produce \\"complete\\" or \\"revised\\" Crowley works that are much better than any previously produced, and much closer to the original Collecting Uncle Al shouldn't cost you a small fortune!!!93/93, ITBOTO,Fr.

Highly recommended for fans of historical romance. The story takes place during the war between England and France.Brittony is the daughter of an important British official. She's a strong and very independent heroine--very stubborn, too. She goes for a long visit to her aunt in France before her parents can manage to marry her off. She becomes friends with a young French idealist and becomes passionately involved with the movement against the French government. Her friend is badly wounded, and makes it to her bedroom window, where he dies in her arms. She is later arrested as a spy, questioned by one who becomes her enemy since she had turned down a marriage proposal for him.Jonathan is half English, half Scot, though he considers himself an Englishman and feels unwelcome by his Scots relatives, leaving the estate he inherits there to be run by his cousin. He's in France on a secret mission for the Crown, and has to abandon it feeling compelled to rescue Brittony and get her out of France and back to safety in England. The story progresses as they travel across France to find passage on a boat to England, having to walk to avoid those searching for Brittony. Danger and intrigue along the way, with Brittony resenting his taking charge since she feels capable of taking care of herself. She exasperates him to no end, yet he admires her spunk and becomes attracted to her, as does she to him despite her resentment. They become closer during their travels, and eventually she wonders if they might not escape and decides she wants to experience loving and to seduce him. He tries to resist, not wanting to marry and knowing that she's not the sort to be trifled with, and that his honor would demand marriage if he succumbs, but they end up coming passionately together.They do eventually make it back to England, but there's still more to come; and they part angrily soon after their return. Jonathan is called away to his estate in Scotland and later finds she is in danger and need of rescue again. The plot moves right along, keeping your interest, with surprises along the way. Their building romance is not an easy one being that both are very independent and used to having their own way, Brittony more so, resenting her limitations as a woman in that time.

A good start for the student interested in Jewish medical ethics, written by a renowned scholar."},{"Title":"Adventures of Riley--Safari in South Africa","review":"This scholarly tale of 9-year-old Riley on \\"Safari in South Africa,\\" with his cousin Alice, aunt Martha, and uncle Max take census of the different breeds of animals.Riley learns the eco system is the responsibility of everyone and every creature in the world must do its part for the world to continue to survive and have balance. Poachers, predators, and developers however tip the scales of the eco system and cause the animal population to become endangered.With each animal they encounter, some fun and interesting facts are revealed regarding their behaviors, eating styles, and play.The authors evoke the help of several zoologist, conservationist, and educators in the animal fields for references and include next to the fun facts illustrations of the references.This tale has awesome illustrations, set on the background of actual safari scenes and with real pictures of safari wildlife. You too will feel as if you were on this adventure.The Adventures of Riley in South Africa is one of a series of - Riley's tales. This book contains information on accessing the Internet so kids can continue more adventures, and a passport book with a stamp of South Africa, so when they read a different book they can collect the stamps.Children will absolutely love this book and learn from it.**A portion of the proceeds will go to the Wildlife Conservation, Smithsonian Institute: Educational Mission and the World Wildlife Fund."},{"Title":"Adventures of Riley--Safari in South Africa","review":"This is a great next stop for Riley (following the previous book, Tigers in Terai). My daughters (ages 7 and 3) loved the book and read it again and again. It's a fabulous book to donate to your school library or child's classroom (at our school, second graders focus on endangered species, so it's perfect for her class). I highly recommend it for a gift, too, for boys or girls, ages 3-10. The illustrations are fabulous and colorful, the photos are fantastic, and the kids will learn something new every time they read it. Where will Riley go next?"},{"Title":"Adventures of Riley--Safari in South Africa","review":"If you trying to make a transition to non-fiction for your young one,nothing could beat this book.Real photography complement the beautiful illustrations along with a fun storyline which is sure to appeal to your young one.Without sounding preaching or boring, it teaches the young ones to respect nature and the varied life that goes along with it..I also love the local art depicted in the footnotes."},{"Title":"Adventures of Riley--Safari in South Africa","review":"If you're going on a safari and you you have small children - it's unlikely that you're packing them and taking them with you.

I would recommend it to anyone with young children."},{"Title":"Coming Out Young and Faithful","review":"&quot;Coming out young and Faithful&quot; is a book of coming-out experiences of spiritual teenagers and young adults: an attempt to call the Christian Church into liberation, justice, and love. According to the editors, its brainchild was the Youth and Young Adult Ministries Program of the United Church of Christ. The goal of this book is to bring their experiences together, which will allow the truth to be told and start the healing process for these g/l/b/t teenagers: &quot;That they will know themselves as defined by the grace of God.&quot; The major strength of this book is the fact that teens wrote it, not degreed professionals. Though they are a great help to us, sometimes, it helps to hear peer's experiences, so that we know were not alone. I suggest this book to anyone who is thinking about religion and homosexuality. Hearing the experiences of g/l/b/t Christians can be a great meditative experience."},{"Title":"Coming Out Young and Faithful","review":"Thank you to the authors and publishers for the existence of this book!!I thoroughly enjoyed reading the other accounts in this book (I wrote Ch 19- Bobbi). I disagree with the reviewer who said it was UCC propoganda because it is just a matter of the channels through which they were able to find students willing to write about their experiences. My campus minister in college suggested that I submit my story.BTW, 6.5 years later we are still together- in fact we held a committment ceremony Labor Day weekend. And despite not being UCC, we had to have a UCC pastor officiate because they are one of the only denominations that won't be defrocked for doing so."},{"Title":"Coming Out Young and Faithful","review":"I read this book when I was younger, but I was also featured in this book - Ch. 11 - And I think I was one of the few non-Christian based stories. I read that someone said it was UCC propoganda, which I'm not going to comment on, because I really had no connection to the gathering of the stories, but I know that at least my essay had nothing to do with UCC at all. If there is someone struggling with their orientation and their spirituality, and their religion isn't offering the kind of support they need, they could use this book to at least get some ideas of what other's experiences have been. Because I didn't find the support I needed in the Christian church system I wish the book offered more than just those kinds of stories for youth of different faith backgrounds, but as another reviewer said, their channels of connecting with youth willing to share their stories were potentially limited. I gave it a three because it gives some good insight and personal experience, but I agree that it could have been more diverse."},{"Title":"Coming Out Young and Faithful","review":"The first-person stories in this book help to build appreciation for the difficult process each story-teller went through to claim the sexuality God gave them, while attempting to maintain a relationship with their religion. These stories are touching, sometimes painful to read, sometimes heart-warming when we hear of an instance of acceptance, welcome, and support. This book should be helpful to straight people who are trying to learn to be more open to diversity, and more affirming of the rights of minorities; and for those glbtiq youth who need to know they are not alone in the struggle to reconcile who they are with what they believe."},{"Title":"Coming Out Young and Faithful","review":"The concept of this book is wonderful... interviews with glbt people who talk about their coming out experiences in a religious setting. This book is a piece of marketing propaganda for the United Church of Christ. Nearly every person mentions how wonderful and magical the UCC is. Personally, denomination should have been left out of it."},{"Title":"The Fabric of Autism: Weaving The Threads Into A Cogent Theory","review":"I commend Judith Bluestone's &quot;The Fabric of Autism: Weaving the Threads into a Cogent Theory&quot; with vigorous enthusiasm. It is a truly awesome book, leading the reader into the maze of internal disorganization experienced by someone with autism - and out of the maze too! That's what makes the book so remarkable. No one has ever done that, to my knowledge. Lots of authors look segmentally at autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and suggest correspondingly segmentalized treatment. This author views (and shares!) the whole.Judith Bluestone combines profound logic and creative genius to EXPLAIN autism - not just ferreting out composite causes, not just describing the spectrum: from the \\"inside\\" of her own life experiences and from the \\"outside\\" of a gentle, wise, compassionate teacher and therapist, she explains autism for everyone. And she goes even one step further: she links the industrialized world's epidemic of disordered neurodevelopment - seen in ADHD, learning disabilities, Tourette's Syndrome, bipolar disorder, depression - to phenomena comparable to the extreme of autism. So this book affords insights applicable beyond the autism spectrum, too.This is a must-read book for anyone who cares about enabling individuals to cope with life's challenges. Anyone who loves someone on the autism spectrum, anyone who teaches or treats someone with an ASD, anyone who has devoted time and energy to studying ASD, will turn a corner into vision: they will SEE autism. And will thereby see the human being struggling, whole.Congratulations to Judith Bluestone for an awesome job!"},{"Title":"The Fabric of Autism: Weaving The Threads Into A Cogent Theory","review":"I read the book quite some time ago and don't remember much of the details. All I know is that it convinced me to give the Handle approach a chance - to give my son a chance in life. We are in the fifth month of a Handle program directly under the author Judith Bluestone.My son has changed so drastically within the last five months. I am very faithful to the exercises because I see the results which include being able to hear and see at the same time, being able to smell, being able to process sequences of sounds, being able to follow more than two commands, being able to use fingers on one hand without the other hand moving, becoming more social etc etc etc (My son is six years old).The book comes with exercises to try so you can get an idea of what a full Handle program would be like.I would like to add that my husband has a PhD in physics and works for NASA. He is very research orientated but when it comes to the Handle program, he just says \\"whatever you are doing, just keep going!\\""},{"Title":"The Fabric of Autism: Weaving The Threads Into A Cogent Theory","review":"This is an excellent book that helps to emphasize that people on the autism/Asperger's (a/A) continuum have many common threads with their neurotypical (NT) counterparts. I want more books like this. I find that message positive, affirming and very helpful indeed.Bluestone does a brilliant job of combining a personal account with clinical research. When you get right down to it, all people have some common traits/aspects/behaviors with their a/A counterparts. The common thread is quite strong; it comes through in the beautiful, bright primary colors that make up the a/A enigma puzzle. Bluestone's research does a lot to unravel the enigma by providing logical explanations for sensory issues and behavioral responses to same.I think this book deserves a place of honor among all professionals, parents and lay people. We all need this book!"},{"Title":"The Fabric of Autism: Weaving The Threads Into A Cogent Theory","review":"I'm a parent with a teenage girl who has autism, so immeditately I was drawn to a woman who wrote about her own experiences with autism. Our family has been through almost everything imaginable, in trying to effectively treat it. I was absolutely at my wits end when a therapist went to a HANDLE training, and called me several times while she was there, to enthusiastically endorse this different approach to treating autism. Let me just say that my husband is highly educated and is a Harvard-trained physician, so he's not one to pay much attention to anecdotal or new-age claims. But he's every bit as convinced as I am, that this holistic method has greatly improved the brain functioning of our autistic daughter. It's helped her to such a degree that we don't even do any other interventions anymore! Reading this book was the eye-opener I needed, then actually meeting Judith in person, and working with her, and being guided by her, was the clincher. This method works, and I think it ought to be part of everyone's treatment program! I think my very favorite thing about HANDLE is that it's based on what is called \\"Gentle Enhancement.\\" It's respectful of the changes that you're asking the body to do, and in doing so, it's easy, enjoyable, methodical, and best of all, it's improved my husband's and my brain functioning too! After years of frantic, forced interventions that frankly didn't work as well as we had hoped they would, we are now in such a beautiful place with our family. It's been over a year since we first began the exercises, and the change in our family is nothing short of amazing! We're so calm and unusually happy, because of the changes we only saw happen after trying the HANDLE method. I only wish we hadn't waited so long before we finally tried it!"},{"Title":"The Fabric of Autism: Weaving The Threads Into A Cogent Theory","review":"The Fabric Of Autism: Weaving Threads Into A Cogent Theory combines informative clinical work with a moving personal memoir to illustrate and illuminate the humanity that is typically masked by autistic behavior. Advocate, teacher, therapist, lecturer, and author Judith Bluestone (who created the Holistic Approach to NeuroDevelopment and Learning Efficiency) personally triumphed over the challenges of autism. From an informative introduction to neuroscientific research, to explanations of developmental processes, to a survey of clinical outcomes to identify the probable causes of autism, The Fabric Of Autism is a perfect introduction for parents, caregivers, and teachers of autistic children."},{"Title":"The Fabric of Autism: Weaving The Threads Into A Cogent Theory","review":"The theory of why autistic individuals behave the way they do, presented in this book, makes a lot of sense to me. I have a nine-year-old with autism and have recently started the HANDLE (Holistic Approach to NeuroDevelopment and Learning Efficiency) program with him that was recommended in the book. He is making significant improvements! I love the fact that this book was written by a woman who actually struggled with autistic characteristics herself. This gave her insights into the autistic body and mind that most authors of books on autism have never experienced and don't understand.Our child is mostly non verbal. We have started many therapy programs with him and seen him make some gains at first but then he gets stuck. According to HANDLE theory, this happens because most autism therapies start too high on the neurodevelopmental ladder. How can you learn to talk when all your mental energy is going into just figuring out where your body is in space, for example.If the paragraph above describes your child, I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Fabric of Autism: Weaving The Threads Into A Cogent Theory","review":"I am a Speech-Language Pathologist, who specialized in working with children with speech disorders,related to autistic spectrum and sensory integration disorders. This book is any amazing view for parents and individuals within the spectrum, of sensory disorders. Because Bluestone, herself, had sensory and spectrum deficits, she explains it form the inside out. an excellent resource. I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"The Fabric of Autism: Weaving The Threads Into A Cogent Theory","review":"If you are looking for a compassionate and insightful understanding of autism this is it.

Judith explains the systems operating in our bodies in a way that is logical, scientific and understandable. She highlights the need for these systems to work inconjunction with each other, and explains how damage to one impacts on the entire being. Her holistic, respectful approach makes so much sense. To read about the foundation of HANDLE and it's principles has given me so much hope for the possible future of my own autistic child. Even if you are not considering implementing a HANDLE program, by reading The Fabric of Autism, you will have many of your questions about autism behaviours answered."},{"Title":"The Fabric of Autism: Weaving The Threads Into A Cogent Theory","review":"Awesome book. Well written and very informative. We also recommend the handle program as well, good stuff"},{"Title":"The Fabric of Autism: Weaving The Threads Into A Cogent Theory","review":"In my opinion, Judith Bluestones \\"HANDLE\\" is pseudoscience at its best. Her approach lacks systematic documentation of clinical outcomes in regards to children with autism. The heart-warming anecdotes and testimonials found in \\"The Fabric of Autism\\" may seem convincing but try not to be fooled by this \\"fad\\" treatment. \\"HANDLE\\" demonstrates the classic signs of pseudoscience including high success rates at a rapid pace for a wide range of disorders. Learners with developmental disabilities have the right to treatments with proven documentation on effectiveness. Most of the issues discussed in \\"The Fabric of Autism\\", are based on sensory integration therapy, another controversial treatment that lacks objective evidence. There is obviously missing rationales for how this approach works. How are the neural pathways strengthened, how are short-circuits un-shorted, and how does any of this makes a difference? Another aspect that is unclear is in regards to Judith Bluestones expertise in the area of autism. Claims of recovering herself from autism hardly seem plausible.My \\"favorite\\" story in \\"The Fabric of Autism\\" is about an autistic and non-verbal girl named Christine. Judith claims that the girl began to speak after a few months of \\"working\\" on her feet. Bluestones rational for this miraculous event is that the girl \\"allowed herself to open to her sensory vulnerabilities in order to be opened to express her sensibilities.\\" Now where is the science in that?"},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty: The Ultimate Beauty Resource","review":"This book goes over EVERYTHING from concealer to smoked out eyes...

I don't think we all need foundation plus prep plus concealer plus this plus that plus.... Also she advocates natural beauty (accept your humped nose! etc...) but her models all have the typical symmetrical look.

There are lots of different looks. Bobbi likes certain looks, and presents them here. But remember the title of the book is BOBBI BROWN BEAUTY. the book is Bobbi's style. Bobbi's opinion. If she really believes there's beauty everywhere, why does she highlight Brooke Shields as the perfect beauty? How is there a perfect beauty on one hand and on the other hand you say everyone has beauty. It's the same old crap... on one hand the makeup artist says Be Youself, You're beautiful. and on the other hand, she says.... but you really want to look like THIS... you really want to look like THIS.

The commentary is interesting, accurate, and worth the read. But I would have liked to have seen more applications... possibly diagrams and the like."},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty: The Ultimate Beauty Resource","review":"... then this is the book that you want. Instead of encouraging you to experiment with wild colors and have fun with makeup, unlike artists such as Kevyn Aucoin, Bobbi recommends keeping the makeup simple and natural. There's only one chapter on experimental beauty and even that's only 1 page and still tells you to keep it safe. However, this is still a pretty good book for many women to read, especially beginners, who want to achieve a pretty but not over-the-top makeup look.Bobbi starts off by giving you her philosophy: modern, pared-down, realistic, and natural make-up, which you will see reflected throughout nearly the entire book. Following that is a chapter about diet and excercise, including types of excercises you can do, the right kinds of foods to eat, etc. There are also individual chapters on skin care, organizing your makeup, most-asked beauty questions, changing the makeup you wear with the seasons, and more. Additionally, there are chapters on making up your lips, eyes, and face, along with using blush, eyeshadow, poweder, foundation, etc. A ten-step makeup application routine is also given for fair, medium, and dark skin tones. The book even has chapters on make-up for different ethnic backrounds, including Asian, Latina, African-American, and global women.What I find rather strange is that Bobbi's own makeup line is full of bright and experimental colors and tools, yet she says that you should always keep your makeup natural. She even says to use the same makeup routine you normally use for your wedding or a black-tie event! Bobbi goes on about how she doesn't like bright-colored eyeshadows, bright lipsticks, smoky eyes, or lots of liner for the daytime. Well, I'm sorry, but I see many women wearing these things in the daytime and the look fine. I am thirteen years old and I wear smoked eyeliner and bright eyeshadow. Is that such a bad thing? Make-up is supposed to be all about having fun and experimenting, but clearly Bobbi doesn't realize or doesn't care about that.Overall, I would say that this is the best book for women who don't wear lots of makeup, women who are just starting to wear makeup, women who want a book about natural makeup, or anyone who wants a beauty self-confidence boost. I don't think it's the best option for people who like to go past basic makeup."},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty: The Ultimate Beauty Resource","review":"This book is perfect for any woman from any background, age group, economic group.

I had hoped she was going to take the typical modern woman like myself (average 35 yr old)and step us through some make up application.

However, I found the book to be lacking in specific techniques for applying makeup.Some sections were fairly thorough, but most (especially the section on doing eye makeup) remained at a really general level. The only main piece of advice I got from the book is to wear yellow-based foundation, concealer, and powder. A lot of the other information Brown gives is just too general; using some diagrams and showing color variations would have made it much more practical.Last year, I purchased Sonia Kashuk's _Real Beauty_, and I definitely recommend that book over this one.

Just because I spend a good portion of my time indoors doesn't mean I have to look like I just rolled out of bed when I go out. I'm still a stay-at-home mom, but my look more closely reveals how wonderful I feel on the inside. &quot;Beauty&quot; addresses the basics of make-up, from tools, to easy application, to how-and where-to shop for make-up. Bobbi also talks at length about loving the looks that God gave you. There are separate chapters on Black, Asian, and Latina beauty, as well as wedding day beauty (oh that I had this book on MY wedding day four-and-a-half months ago!) and make-up for photography and television. When they say ULTIMATE, they weren't kiddin'. This is a good reference for beginners and the experienced alike.

Bobbi Brown Beauty lacks variety , and is basic and boring if what you're looking for is fun, glamorous, made up looks --which is why I only rated it three stars. Look to this book if you love the no-makeup look, are pressed for time, or have never worn makeup before and need a place to start. (This is a great starting place). ..."},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty: The Ultimate Beauty Resource","review":"An excellent basic book for those who don't know a whole lot about makeup as well as for those who do. The emphasis here is on attaining a natural, finished application look without the obvious &quot;Ah, she's wearing makeup!&quot; A comprehensive guide, it covers everything from moisturizing, to cleansing, to sun protection, to why not to use white eyeliner.For those people looking for more &quot;fun&quot; and &quot;experimental&quot; looks, though, I would recommend Kevyn Aucoin's _Making Faces_ instead."},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty: The Ultimate Beauty Resource","review":"I am so disappointed in this book. I will not buy so much as a lipstick from her again. I bought this book only to discover: 1. My biggest complaint - She has pages and pages of the &quot;most beautiful and stylish women of all time&quot; and there is not an African American face in the entire bunch (except in the black chapter). It's extremely narrow minded that her standards of beauty are so limited. I discourage all Asians, Blacks, and Latinas from buying this book. She has these &quot;ghetto chapters&quot; where she addresses women with &quot;special beauty needs,&quot; namely, they're black, Asian, or older. For black women, she seems to focus on lips, answering questions like &quot;How can I make my lips smaller.&quot; Yes, she issues a little disclaimer that she thinks full lips are beautiful, but it doesn't negate what she implies through the pictures for 241 straight pages. 2. She doesn't give any detailed instructions for applying makeup. 3. ALL of the tips and advice she gives are common knowledge to anyone who regularly reads women's magazines.To people of color - don't waste your money buying this book. You don't exist according to this book, or you're somehow different enough to need a special chapter. Who wants to be treated like a freak when skin is skin - she could have done a better job of integrated older women and women of color throughout the book. To European women - The photos that she has in the book are gorgeous. Variation within your group is celebrated as it should be. But please, have empathy. Imagine if you were part of a group that is not portrayed as extensively and as beautifully in the book (for example, there are no women in the book over a size 6)."},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty: The Ultimate Beauty Resource","review":"This book is organized beautifully and is full of all the makeup advice you will ever need. It is easy to understand and the photos are pleasing to look at. It has chapters on each type of makeup (foundation, powder, blush, eyeshadow, eyeliner, mascara, lipstick), as well as skin care, makeup tools, makeup organization and storage, etc. It tells you how to make a &quot;flaw&quot; a signature feature you can be proud of, how to do your makeup for an interview, and more. It contains practical advice about how to find your own makeup style, how to choose colors for your skin type, and how to be natural beauty by using secrets of the trade.This book is not about becoming something you are not by painting and contouring your face, it's about working with what you have and making the most of the features you were blessed with. It is an education in basic beauty techniques that will help you look fabulous, no matter who you are.I am 29 years old and I knew a lot about makeup and felt pretty good about how I looked before I read this book, but I learned a few simple things that have helped me look in the mirror and see how beautiful I can really be. (Her tip on yellow-toned powder is my favorite!) I highly recommend it for women of all ages and skin-types."},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty: The Ultimate Beauty Resource","review":"In today's day and age appearance really matters. That's why this book is so great. I've seen countless ladies with tacky, loud or unflattering makeup that has thrown off an otherwise polished look. Bobbi Brown's approach to makeup will help you avoid that sort of mistake. Whether you are a young professional woman who's looking for a more serious look or you are an older lady who would just like to feel beautiful in your own skin, this is a great resource. It will teach you the overall concepts and (most importantly) the specific techniques for applying cosmetics in a way that enhances your natural beauty. You won't look made up, you'll look gorgeous."},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty: The Ultimate Beauty Resource","review":"I actually got this book in 1998-- when I was 19. In between then and now, I've never really bothered with makeup, since I think I look just fine without it. However, after going out on dates, to parties, and hanging out with people, I realized I have no frickin' clue how to do makeup even if I want to.So, I picked Bobbi's book back up.It's a great book for me-- someone who has no clue how to do makeup. If you're already well-versed in the basics, move on. This book teaches you how to select makeup, brushes, and other tools, and how to do BASIC application techniques. Which is great. For me.Besides the \\"natural beauty\\" theme throughout the book, there's also the \\"Bobbi is awesome\\" theme, which is vomit-worthy. I mean, is it really necessary to have a section for designer testimonials about how great Bobbi is? Will that make us apply makeup better???Also, I strongly object to her advice that you need to put on concealer and lipstick if you're dropping the kids off at school in your sweatpants. Let's be realistic, Bobbi."},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty: The Ultimate Beauty Resource","review":"I found this book to be very helpful. I really like Bobbi's philosophy. I too think that nothing is prettier or fresher than a women wearing makeup that flatters what she looks like, instead of wearing makeup that doesn't really show what you look like but draws more attention to the makeup itself. That is not what makeup is all about. This book is perfect for everyday makeup, where you want to look good, but you don't want anything to stand-outish or too bright. This applies to me because I am still in high school, where you have to look good, but still be a little conservative."},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty: The Ultimate Beauty Resource","review":"I found this book more than just a cook book because it contains many thoughtful message from bobbi brown. she encourages us to enjoy make-ups, not to make a 'fake' painted face, but to make a pretty face that can bring in all the lucks. Also it contains many practical suggestions on 'buyer beware.' It does not give us actually how to use the brushes to put cheeks or how to put eyelines, but that we need to go to the beauty counters, I guess."},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty: The Ultimate Beauty Resource","review":"I really like Bobbi's approach to make up when it comes to her line of cosmetics, but what I read in this book was really disapointing... Ok, &quot;less is more&quot; works for most of the time in makeup, but she almost tells you not to wear any! And the only reason I decided to purchase the book was because I was in love with her makeup, specially her colored mascaras in colors like navy, plum and henna... Imagine my surprise when she says that you should never use colored mascaras because they never look good on you!!! I wanted to throw the book away. Basically, she shows a really boring palette of colors, and takes all the fun and play out of makeup. Came to the conclusion that I should've stayed true to Kevin Aucoin, who knows how to make a woman look gorgeous and special. Bobbi's book could be much more exciting..."},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty: The Ultimate Beauty Resource","review":"Although I have been doing makeup for sometime, this book gave me plenty of ideas for new ways to look at it.very detailed and interesting read.

She does have small sections for ethnic beauty, diet/exercise, men's beauty/makeup & special occassion makeup. BB is all about neutral/natural looks so everything she suggests is timeless. Has several chapters devoted to working with your natural beauty & playing up your flaws instead of trying to camoflauge them. Book isn't as visually appealing as many others but makes up for it in the amount of information given. While instructions don't come with visual guides, they are still explained extremely well so that visual aids are really necessary. She has a lot more \\"don'ts\\" than I've seen in other books (\\"Don't wear shimmer blush\\", etc). In no way does she try to get you to spend a lot of money. She very much advocates a more minimal approach, even to the point of suggesting plastic baggies as makeup bags. She also does not self-promote & even features other makeup lines in her pictures.I think this is a great reference manual. Excellent book for someone new to makeup or someone who needs to be brought out of a dated look but even the more experienced can pick up a trick or two.

I have already implemented her techniques for concealer and eye shadow, and am really amazed that such relatively subtle 'tweaks' in my current routine can reap such improved results. Her answers to FAQ's are tremendously enlightening.I sincerely hope, however, that she follows this book with a book concentrating on making up 'real' faces. Kevyn Aucoin shows this sort of real-woman makeover so well, certainly on the beauty.com website, however his philosophy greatly differs from Bobbi's and the result is more suited to photo shoots than real life.

When a friend of mine did a makeover on me it hit me like a ton of bricks: I, too, can be pretty! Thus I bought the Bobbi Brown book knowing essentially nothing about makeup, and it transformed my life. I read it cover to cover and then followed her tips and tricks to slowly introduce one step of makeup after another. The change it has brought to my life sounds like a cliche but is incredibly true; having grown up feeling irreparably ugly, I now feel pretty every single day, no matter what! Just because I learned how to use simple, basic makeup that is effortless to apply and easy to maintain. Bobbi's book explains the basics of makeup, colour and application and also skims topics like exercise, nutrition and wellbeing. Although her tone is often self-congratulatory and preachy, the tips are so good that it's easy to overlook those flaws. If you need a full introduction to making yourself feel prettier, this is the book for you. Bobbi Brown has changed my life with this book, and I still look up tips now that I've learned to walk on my own."},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty: The Ultimate Beauty Resource","review":"Bobbi Brown is a legend in the arena of makeup, she gives alot of great tips in this book.

This is an excellent book"},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty: The Ultimate Beauty Resource","review":"As a way to get in touch with my make-up technique after almost four years of reading exclusively textbooks, I decided to read about it from the word of one of today's most well-known and acknowledged makeup artists. However, this book has left me with mixed feelings. Although it is undoubtedly a compendium of great suggestions (notice I say \\"great\\" not \\"excellent\\" or, more importantly, NEW), Bobbi Brown's ultimate message is that understatement is the key to good make-up.What is mind-blogging to me is the fact that the woman studied theatrical make-up at the prestigious Emerson College in Boston, yet she is petrified to even suggest something minimally colorful! Her advise never veers from \\"use ONLY yellow-based foundation, powder and concealer, translucent and other colour powders make a woman look washed out, never use colour mascaras, cellulite creams DO NOT work (she is wrong here, Lancaster and Clarins have excellent products that DO work, I have tried them myself and even reviewed some here at Amazon)\\" and, my personal favorite of all her contradictions: \\"I have purposely avoided colors like emerald green, turquoise and purple\\" for eye shadow (page 111). I would then ask her what she was thinking when she came out with the beautiful, gorgeous, vivid colours in her \\"Eye Brights Make up palette\\", which I have recently ordered and I am anxiously awaiting its arrival in the post. The truth is, make up is supposed to be fun. Stylish, yes, but fun. Maybe it is the fact that this is an old book (it was published in 1997). But it simply lacks the appropriate guidance. For instance, you will find in it suggestions as to what to do and what not to do to wear make-up that lasts for hours, how to remove makeup from clothing before it stains, how to clean your tools, even suggestions on fitness. However there is no actual reference on technique, i.e. how to correctly apply eye shadow, no pictures or photos that present a step-by-step method. In fact, most of the photos in the book are old and unbecoming. From a book written by a world-renowned makeup artist, I see this as a major flaw.Moreover, the subjects she presents seem to be just as plain as she is. To illustrate this, one need look no further than her comments on actress Andie McDowell. Although she is pretty (sort of), she is the type of woman who has always looked old and wrinkled in my view, even when she was younger. Ever since the time she did \\"Green card\\", with the genial G&eacute;rard Depardieu, to the present day, McDowell has always exhibited very defined crows' feet around her eyes, as well as deep laugh lines. It has always baffled me how companies like L'Oreal keep showing her as an example of a fresh and beautiful face. To Brown, this is the essence of mesmerizing beauty, and although she packs a powerful message in the premise that the features that women usually criticize about themselves are the ones that in all actuality make them unique (e.g. Cindy Crawford's mole), considering a woman like McDowell a breathtaking beauty who \\"when you meet her, she intentionally puts you at ease with her sense of humour so that her incredible beauty is not overwhelming\\" is a bit too much (page 59).One thing is for sure, Brown's book is just as understated as her own look. She always seemed sort of plain to me as far as a makeup artist goes. Personally, I prefer a more daring approach to makeup, a bit daring and yes, colourful! Thank God for minds like those of Vivienne Westwood and the late Alexander McQueen, who dare show us what fashion, elegance and style with a twist are all about!"},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty: The Ultimate Beauty Resource","review":"DON'T BOTHER with this book if you: 1. Want to learn how to apply make-up (try a Kevin Aucoin book for that--he's the best!). 2.

Prefer to avoid self-righteous people who will tell you what you should eat, wear and think (which is everything that they eat, wear &amp; think). 5. Believe that soliciting others' opinions about you for publication is a little too desperate. 6.

WELL! Beauty comes from within, if you don't feel good, no matter how much makeup you werar you will never think you look good. This is what the book is all about.

However, Bobbi tends to be a bit \\"bossy\\" and restrictive regarding some makeup techniques. For example, she \\"forbids\\" you to apply foundation on the eyelid, whereas I have found that foundation on the eyelid, properly applied and followed by powder, can make your eye makeup last much longer. If you like the natural approach to makeup, buy this book, but there is a better one in the market: Sonia Kashuk, Natural Beauty. If you have money to spend, buy both, but you will find that you will end using Sonia's advice a lot more than Bobbi's.If you don't want to spend a lot of money, buy Sonia Kashik's instead , for it includes an awesome video that will teach you more than any other book will!!!"},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty: The Ultimate Beauty Resource","review":"I've had this book since it first came out, and it's completely changed my beauty routine!

Cannot say enough wonderful things about it!"},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty: The Ultimate Beauty Resource","review":"I was very disappointed with the book. I have been wearing makeup since I was 15. I take it as my hobby and what I needed was a book that could show me different techniques, different ways of applying makeup other than the usual ways I was taught over the years, different color combinations. This book is REALLY BASIC. It really does not give you a step by step in how to achieve a certain look. So if this is what you are looking for go for another book."},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty: The Ultimate Beauty Resource","review":"After reading and enjoying Kevyn Aucoin's makeup books, Bobbi Brown seems a bit ham-fisted in her approach -- a bit more &quot;don't EVER do this, don't EVER wear that&quot; than I'd like to see in a makeup book. Bobbi's technique will leave you looking natural and gorgeous, but there isn't much room for experimentation or originality."},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty: The Ultimate Beauty Resource","review":"This is one of the few book reviews that I have ever felt compelled to write. I am a 36yo mother of 3 boys ages 6 and under (one of whom has autism and requires a lot of therapy time and administration of his academic goals). I don't have a lot of time to devote to skin care or makeup application, but I have chronic adult acne, I got tired of over-drying my skin due to medical treatment options, and I wanted to learn to apply day makeup that will last, but not take too much time to apply. In short, I bought Bobbi's book to learn how to take care of my skin without much investment in time or money.Bobbi's book is about comprehensive skin care and day makeup application. First thought: keep your skin hydrated. Drink plenty of water, moisturize with an SPF lotion during the day and perhaps a heavier lotion at night after cleansing and toning with a non-drying toner. Use a pumice stone in the shower for rough feet and use a spray bottle with lightly scented oil prior to exiting the shower, then pat dry. She gives a nice recipe for a homemade scented salt scrub as an added bonus. I especially like that she doesn't push her products at you, but she has them available at higher end stores or online if you would like to give them a try. After DH surprised me with a facial a few weeks ago (my first one), I learned that my face was excessively dry (a relative shock to me because I had stopped topical medication and I was always told by dermatologists that I have oily skin and to wash with soap several times per day). As a rule, I have never moisturized. I thought that moisturizers would make my acne worse. I began a daily regime 6 weeks ago with Neutrogena products that I purchased from a local store that cost under $50 that will likely last 4-6 months (you don't need to use very much-just the size of a pea for cleanser and two squirts for lotion). I am thrilled to say my skin hasn't looked better since before the dreaded teen acne years. I bought a few of Bobbi's products because I couldn't find an eye cream or heavier face cream that I liked at a local store. I purchased her shine control face gel for use in the T-zone during the day and her compact foundation because my face has quite a bit of red undertones. After trying it, I declared it to be the first foundation that I ever used. I always wore a mask with other brands and there truly is no comparison between her foundation and others (at least the many that I have tried).My daily regime took 1.5 hours the first two days because I needed to think about every single step. On day three it took 45 minutes. On day five it took 30 minutes. Now I can complete everything in the morning within 20 minutes (including makeup) and evenings take me just 10-15 minutes depending if I have some 'extras' thrown in, i.e., face scrub, mask, or salt scrub for my feet.While other reviewers are valid in their assertion that this is not a book that teaches you makeup skills that will make you look like someone else, I very much believe that Bobbi's approach helps you to feel better about yourself and to embrace the unique qualities about yourself that make you an individual. She is like the most open friend you could have who will support and validate you for your uniqueness.On some occasions, however, it's nice to undergo a transformation and to separate from the sameness and predictability of life. On those occasions, I wholeheartedly recommend Kevin Aucoin's books 'Face Forward' and 'Making Faces.' He sometimes draws out individuality and sometimes transforms. His books depict with drawings and pictures exactly how to apply makeup and he supplies the before and after pictures of women with much diversity (except Asian) for motivation: I think both are much better books for Hispanic and Black makeup application techniques. His techniques are very sensible and easy to master. As other reviewers of his book have mentioned, he talks fairly extensively about the great merits of all the beautiful people with whom he works and while it does get a little tiresome, he also represents himself as a friend and supports and validates them for their relative successes (BTW, some of them are not celebrities).Overall, Bobbi Brown's book is INDISPENSIBLE for 1) skin care for ALL women 2) makeup application general principles for many women (not Asian or Black beauty) 3) Organizing supplies 4) Uses of different brushes, plus many more topics. She doesn't supply how-to pictures, but she covers everything else so well in minute details that I felt empowered and highly capable of achieving great results with just a relatively little investment in time and money. It is, after all, why I bought the book to begin with."},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty: The Ultimate Beauty Resource","review":"This book's a quick read and if you're a regular magazine reader, you won't pick up much. The best part was the colour suggestions for eyeliner etc based on your colouring, but Bobbi's philosophy of always looking natural has resulted in a book which doesn't cover all the bases you'd want it to - some women want to play with their look as well, not just have a minimalist look all the time.I'd recommend Stephanie Seymour's &quot;Beauty Secrets for Dummies&quot; (part of the &quot;Dummies&quot; series) which is excellent and contains more tips, and Kevyn Aucoin's &quot;Making Faces&quot; which really inspires you to unleash your creativity and try different looks."},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty: The Ultimate Beauty Resource","review":"I think that this book is good to read if you aren't very interested in makeup. Because despite the fact that Bobbi herself is a hugely successful artist she tones down her advice DRASTICALLY assuming that the average reader couldn't handle a brush or a pencil to save her own life. It becomes almost condescending at points when she says what should be left up to professional makeup artists and when she dictates what colors go with your skin and hair color and exactly the way you should apply them...everyday! She leaves little to no room for imagination and seems to think you'll seriously INJUR yourself if you go too far with your makeup. Someone should really tell her its JUST MAKEUP! ITS NOT PERMANENT! However there are some very useful if very basic tips in here that will help you with your own basic beauty routines. But if you want inspiration or artistry you'll have to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty: The Ultimate Beauty Resource","review":"This is a basic book for anyone somewhat interested in makeup. Bobbi Brown covers a number of special topics but most of the info is for real life and quite practical. This book includes BB's life, philosophy and ideas on diet, exercise and skin care. Special sections on African-American, Asian, Latina, pregnancy, bridal, teenage and 40 plus beauty. Good notes on makeup for photography and television. Interesting sections on makeup brushes, simple 10 step makeup application, use of concealers, foundation &amp; powder, brows, eyes and blush. Overall a pretty boring book for any one really interested in makeup but good for those that are not &quot;obsessed&quot; with cosmetics."},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty: The Ultimate Beauty Resource","review":"I've read a lot of books about makeup and I consider this as the best book I've ever read about this subject. It's very clear what she means and instead of pushing you in a direction, she gives you the strenght to get the best out of yourself! It's not difficult to read (even not for me; I'm from Holland!) but really fun and I read it on and on! So if you're a newbee or already using make-up or a makeup artist like me, this is really a MUST HAVE!"},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty: The Ultimate Beauty Resource","review":"If you never really learned how makeup works, what product to use for which purpose, or where and how to apply it, this is a great guide. It begins with the basics from square one and moves on to how to get really natural results and develop special looks for different occassions. If you're looking for how to do \\"trendy\\" makeup, this is not the book for you, but for classy, natural looks, it's a must have. My favorite section was the photos and descriptions of the appropriate tools to use to apply different products. That brush counter at Sephora can get a little intimidating if you don't know what you're looking for."},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty: The Ultimate Beauty Resource","review":"Now I know what color combinations to use, how to purchase the right shade of foundation, and how to be comforable with my looks"},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty: The Ultimate Beauty Resource","review":"This women as a genius...she's just brilliant. I love her make-up and am a longtime customer. This book is amazing and such a great resource for all women out there. She's clear, articulate, and so helpful. Each look is covered step by step...with such detail. It's a must have for everyone out there."},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty: The Ultimate Beauty Resource","review":"Bobbi Brown does a terrible job \\"sharing\\" her secrets. The book is more about how great she is, than actual help to real-world women. The book is so general that only a person who has no tiny idea about makeup and color theory can find something new in there. Her advice is more a common sense than a professional approach. There is absolutely nothing for women with light skin, hair, and eyes.Overall, if you want to know something new and valuable about the makeup, look somewhere else."},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty: The Ultimate Beauty Resource","review":"For being such a make-up MASTER, Bobbi Brown sure didn't show it in this book. Very dull and unexciting, not to mention anyone who's ever put on eyeliner could tell you the same tips."},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty: The Ultimate Beauty Resource","review":"Upon reviewing this book, I found that Bobbi is quite fond of brown mascara as the basic color for all people. Well, I have black hair and blacker eyelashes and I've tried brown mascara (I didn't look at the label) and it looks VERY STRANGE on black eyelashes. It looked pretty artificial. Other than that, this book was ok although I prefer Kevyn Aucoin's book &quot;Making Faces&quot; over this one."},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty: The Ultimate Beauty Resource","review":"at first,i thought this book would be really posh,and design for top models only! was i wrong!this a really helpful book,and the author is focusing on the inner beauty of the human rather than what is outside;she means that with a little respect for yourself,a bit of time and some good (but not expensive),products,you too can be and feel pretty,glamorous,or sexy,depending on what you want to achieve.my next goal,after reading this book,is to try bobbi's makeup line."},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty: The Ultimate Beauty Resource","review":"This book may be good for the woman who knows little about makeup and its application, but it is much too long winded. Each product has about 3 to 4 pages of instructions (you don't need that much instruction on how to apply lipstick, not even the beginner). Ms. Brown also covers too many subjects, and gets into fields she is not qualified to advise on, such as fitness and diet (she's a professional makeup artist not a dietician or physical instructor). Also some of her makeup advise is odd and does not work (ie; line your lips AFTER you have applied your lipstick - Huh?). My advise is skip this one and buy Morgen Schick's &quot;Your Makeover&quot;."},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty: The Ultimate Beauty Resource","review":"This is a great book for every woman to read. It kept me captivated and wanting more. There is a great variation of information from skin care, exercise, makeup application and creating your own beauty style. Bobbi Brown is a bit opinionated at times and I didn't always agree with her(I am a makeup artist too) - but I still thoroughly enjoyed the book and think it is a WONDERFUL place for women to start by learning their personal beauty style and daily beauty routine."},{"Title":"Bobbi Brown Beauty: The Ultimate Beauty Resource","review":"I bought this book back when it was published, in the 90s.

I borrowed this from my mom years ago and loved it, then bought my own copy and loved it again! It provides the ABC's of exactly how it works when you apply your make up for this or that effect. I am actually a professional face painter and have been using the techniques I found in this book (with a different color pallet of course!) to drastically altering children and adults to look like everything under the sun.

It is truly comprehensive in it's coverage of the entire state. Being a member of a military family, moving to a new location can be a very frightening prospect. This book has the type of in-depth information that makes Washington feel familiar without ever even being there! I've looked at MANY travel guides (Fodor's, etc.) and the Washington Handbook outshines them all."},{"Title":"Moon Handbooks Washington","review":"This book covered every area we were interested in visiting.

We had the Frommers book and off the beaten path book. The Moon book was the one we kept going back to."},{"Title":"Moon Handbooks Washington","review":"The first Moon book that I purchased several years ago was the book on Oregon. We made significant travel arrangements based on the information in that book and we were never disappointed.An upcoming trip to Seattle/San Juans is based on the information in the Washington book. The real beauty is that the book leads you to the most likely area to visit, gives references to hotels, etc., then you can complete your research by reviewing up-to-date information about that spot/hotel online. We chose Orcas island for 2 days before heading to Seattle and I do not expect to be disappointed.The authors are even-handed and complete --- they are not elitists, reviewing only the high-end accomodations. They have a good sample of a broad range of places. They point out lesser known restaurants and scenic spots as well.I have found their advice in the Oregon, Washington, Coastal California and New England books to be quite excellent.I have purchased quite a few different travel books in the past, but Moon Handbooks are my travel book of choice."},{"Title":"Moon Handbooks Washington","review":"Even though published in 2003, this is by far the best advailable WA guide book.

This is the first time I've bought a Moon Handbook that covers an entire state; the coverage is less in-depth for specific sites of interest like Olympic National Park, yet there is plenty of information for the many places a visitor to Washington State might want to see. Reading this book made me look forward to my trip even more."},{"Title":"Moon Handbooks Washington","review":"I've only had a minute amount of time to read some of the text, but it does seem to be fun and valuable information.

Not only did I love seeing the history of Big Moose Lake through the wonderful collection of vintage picture post cards, but I couldn't resist comparing each picture to the corresponding snapshots I've taken over the years! It is truly amazing how little has changed geographically in this incredibly scenic area of New York State. Scheffler and Carey, however, also do a great job showing the reader how social factors -- like fashion and entertainment -- have changed in the Adirondacks in the past 100 years. A wonderful tour of photographs that transport the reader around the lake and through time."},{"Title":"Big Moose Lake (NY) (Images of America)","review":"This book will be near and dear to anyone who has visited Big Moose Lake or the Adirondacks.For the ones who have visited the region before, the book provides a trip back in time and describes how the popular vacation spot got it's start. The best thing about the book and the lake is that not many things have changed since the early 1900's. When reading or just looking at the pictures, travelers are able to take a quick trip around the lake they love whenever they please."},{"Title":"Big Moose Lake (NY) (Images of America)","review":"The book provided a wonderful backdrop for an upcoming trip to Big Moose Lake.

Mary Lee Smith presents, and the re-presents her case in this book. It is repetitive, slanted, but still has some important things to say. It will change the way you look at the educational political arena. It is NOT light reading."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is by far one of my favorite books of all time. I have worn out one copy from repeated reads. This book is absolutely engrossing. You get completely lost in the historical aspects of the congolese. Character developement is exceptional. I love the changes in point-of-view, which transforms great characterization into the exceptional. You love the women of the Price family instantly. Very heart-wrenching, and a must-read for anyone."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I had some qualms about starting this book, but the opening few pages hooked me, and I never looked back. The writing is simply beautiful, among the best I've ever read. The story is slowly absorbing, and by the time you hit page 100 or so, you'll have a had time putting this book down.At first I thought the approach of telling the story from 5 different points of view would be distracting, but it never was. I came to look forward to each character's take on what was going on, and the author does an excellent job of creating individual and memorable voices for each character.The story is surprisingly funny, but the overall tone is one of great sadness, a mourning for the Congo, for the U.S., and for the personal tragedies that befall the Price family in the novel.Overall, this is one of the best recent books I've read, and it deserves a wide audience. I will never forget it, and I believe that it will become a modern classic that will be enjoyed for years to come. It's the kind of book that readers and writers can marvel at for its beautiful use of language and character to tell a story that is as haunting as it is memorable."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Excellent book. Having spent time working as a volunteer in Africa in a similar type setting, I found the descriptions of the environment and the people, native Africans as well as whites very accurate. Her development of the different characters, the mother, father and four daughters was superb and very thoughtful and ran the gamut from the religious zealot to the one who totally adopts the native lifestyle. I personally also liked the philosophies that she presents about the differences in how we all individually approach life. One of the best books that I have read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is the type of book that may seem daunting at first glance. The subject itself may be intimidating--a family of missionaries journeys to the Belgian Congo in the midst of famine, political turmoil and war. But despite the complexity of the subjects, this book is a delightful and engaging read. Another author may have bogged the reader down, but Kingsolver makes learning about the many issues in this book a wonderful, effortless experience. This book educates the reader about an abundance of issues, especially the political climate in Africa during the 1960's. I learned many, many things from this novel, and I grew to love the characters. I did not want this book to end--that is my highest recommendation!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The characters were very well developed. The book came to a peak once the plot unfolded but I felt let down by the ending. It was great to learn about the Congo, and the people, and the culture, and especially the struggles of missionaries in that time. Don't let the word &quot;Bible&quot; in the title turn you away from this book!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Since buying this book I have already read it THREE times. Although I love to read I'm usually somewhat picky as to what I do read. It has to spark my intrest from the first sentence--this book did just that! Even though it might seem long--the whole book is an interesting series of events that all tie together--taking the reader through the ups and downs (and eventually the downfall) of the Price family. Told by the four daughters and wife of Nathan Price, we get beautifully detailed scenes. Through which we also learn about the personalities of each character and how each one will act in a certain situation. the author obviously did a great deal of research on the topic. Being able to give rich descriptions, strong characters, a believable plot, all with the strong and true background of the Congos fight for independence."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is definitely NOT a beach read. I found this book difficult to get through, only because I was afraid I would miss a nuance. Perhaps the most wonderful thing about this book is how well all of the characters are developed: it's hard to believe that one woman wrote basically journal entries for four very different women and so skillfully maintained their individual personalities. I wouldn't recommend this for someone who is looking for mindless entertainment. This book is really food for thought. I'd give it 5 stars except there are a few places where it drags and maybe belabors a point just a tiny bit."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I actually didn't want to read this book, I thought it was very religious related. And it was, but it was so GOOD. I started reading it and I could hardly put it down. It is like savoring a candybar, so delicious. This is a must, absoulutely have to read. It is a long book, but I found myself wanting more you get so involved with the people in this book. I am a Barbara Kingsolver fan for life now."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I should start by saying that I was by no means excited to read this novel. I organized a book club with a few friends some time ago, and one of our members chose this book (much to my initial disappointment).My impression after 100 pages or so was that Barbara Kingsolver is a brilliant writer, but that the story was a bit tedious. I couldn't have been more wrong. Kingsolver sets the scene with the first 150 pages and then takes off, launching a spellbinding tale about an overzealous and arrogant missionary who drags his wife and four daughters into the heart of darkness in the Belgian Congo (circa 1959). As though you didn't know that bad things happen when someone attempts to push his culture onto others who see the world in their own way, we are told that a tragedy will unfold in the very first chapter.The story is told from the perspective of the missionary's wife and four daughters, and each character comes alive on paper. Each speaks in a unique voice, sees the world in a unique way, and has a different way of dealing with the difficult situation that they slowly find themselves in. As a man, I was at first dismayed that Kingsolver chose to leave out the male perspective by only presenting us with the female family-members' points of view; however, this turns out to have been the wiser decision. This is by no means a male bashing book (although a few other reviewers here seem to think so), and I find it hard to believe that anyone who has actually finished this book could draw that conclusion.A great college course could be taught on this one book. There are so many things to say about the issues it unearths, the insight into human behavior it reveals, and the talent it belies, that I will say only one thing: &quot;read this book.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This was my first novel by Kingsolver and found it wonderful. Her rich description of the people and places of Congo made you feel like you were there. The story is told in present day by Orleanne Price, mother of four girls and wife of Nathan Price, a Baptist preacher who goes down to the Congo to save all the natives' souls through baptism and the teaching of Christianity. The rest of the story is told as it is happening by each one of the sisters, with their own experiences and beliefs.The book is filled with the history and politics of the Congo from the mid-60's to current day. I found the mix of fiction and history pleasant and was fascinated by the facts I didn't know about the Congo/Zaire area of Africa. This is a great read for anyone that loves to learn a little about history with a great fictional story thrown in."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I loved The Poisonwood Bible.I grew up in that sort of culture (ultra-fundamentalist Christian, critical of other people's lifestyles and beliefs, and thinking that it is our God-given duty to convert everyone else to our own religion) although my immediate family wasn't in missions. But my aunt's family was, and in the same time frame as the book. My cousins were born in Africa and one of them has been a missionary in Zambia now for over 25 years, for the same church that we grew up in.So I really related to the book and can vouch for its authenticity.Interestingly, my sister hated The Poisonwood Bible. She said that, for her, it brought back too many bad memories. I said that it educates people about what some (many?) religious missions are like. Her reply was that most readers think that the extreme belief system portrayed in the book is a fictional invention of Kingsolver's; and that only a few people like us, who have experienced it for themselves, realize that missions like that really do exist.This is typical of the responses I've seen to this book: two very well-read people with exactly the same background, but with two opposite opinions. A book that inspires this kind of discussion is undeniably thought-provoking and mentally stimulating."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I had to read this book for my English class and it actually has an interesting plot. However, it did not hold up or follow through the way I had thought it would. This book bored me so much. There are exciting parts, but they are so far apart that it's hard to keep interest. Orleanna's parts sound like a depressed teenager plagued by guilt. Ruth May's parts are so childishly written that they seem out of place in the novel. Adah's parts make her seem condescending sometimes. Rachel's parts are usually just a waste of pages. Leah is the only character who seems to have an actual development, but most of her parts in the beginning are slow and not very interesting.Honestly, half of this book could be ripped out and it still would not have been very good. I wish I hadn't wasted my time reading this in hopes that it would get better, because it didn't."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book has some flaws but I cannot overstate how deeply I was affected by reading it. There is an element of \`Real American' pop culture on the march in the USA today, led by the proudly incurious Sarah Palin. If I cannot afford to send each of them abroad to gain perspective on life outside the United States then perhaps I can ask them to read this book. American's today tend to idealize the 1950's and this book takes place just when that decade was wrapping up. America was still basking in the righteous victory of WWII and enjoying the grandfatherly governance of Uncle Ike Eisenhower. Did you know that while that was going on that the US government was busy overthrowing democratically elected governments and murdering leaders in Africa because of interests in mineral mining? Did you know that this has contributed strongly to a legacy of madmen dictators during Africa's initial post colonial period? All of this was going on while America was enjoying the fabled era of poodle skirts and cherry cokes and Africa is still paying the price today. There is one singular flaw in the way Kingsolver wrote this book. The patriarch of the American missionary family, Nathan Price, is an extreme caricature of close mindedness and intolerance. I have met people like him but he is so over the top that readers could be put off the entire story. That caricature does mean to me that Kingsolver is leading us by the nose with this fable. However, it is a message that is not part of the collective American conscience but perhaps ought to be and the nose leading was welcomed by me."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"One of the best stories I've read. There's a lot of calamity and adventure in The Belgian Congo circa 1959-1960, when a small-town Georgia preacher (Nathan Price) takes a one-year Christian missionary assignment with his wife and four daughters (ages 5 and 16 with 15 year-old twins). Told from the very different perspectives of the four daughters, with brief antidotes from the mother Orleanna, the book has a fascinating cast of characters. Anatole Ngemba an educated African who helps The Prices interpret and manage there way around was one of my favorites along with an 8-year-old African boy named Nelson.Very thought provoking journey about what human life and nature is all about. I found myself thinking about the book a lot in between reading time. This is one reading experience that I can't wait to re-visit in the future."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Four young girls accompany their missionary father and their mother to a Congolese village, and none of them manages to truly leave Africa again, although each reacts to the place in a completely different way, with a completely different outcome. I would not call this story, in which the naive family survives famine, drought, malaria, crocodiles and ant infestations, particularly uplifting. In fact, it is a downright depressing examination of the problems of Africa compounded by Westerners' attempts to bring our god and our ways into a completely alien culture."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is one of those books that I put down during the first one hundred pages the first time I picked it up. Many months later I picked it up and could not put it down. Kingsolver brings together so many strands (Cold War politics, liberation theology, palindromes, Southern fiction, Africa, and ecology just to name a few) in such a seemless and entertaining novel.I re-read it and found so many more layers the second time around. I now have a new favorite animal thanks to Kingsolver: the Okapi."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I was already a big Kingsolver fan, and this one goes on my list of all-time favorite books. She constructs complex stories with lots of history lessons thrown in, then writes so beautifully I have to reread out loud many passages, paragraphs and ideas."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"A great story and has something for everyone. Some of the stories in this book made me laugh out loud. This book is on my top ten list of all time favorites."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is a story of children and adults growing and making decisions, sometimes for the better but sometimes not. It's frustrating and depressing to read about their actions, which means, of course, that it's well-written. I may read it again to catch more of the symbolism. I suggest a reading group for this one!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I started this book after I had surgery as a way to pass time and I regret not reading it earlier. Poisonwood Bible contains the rich story of a family of a reverend, his wife and four daughters. Each daughter brings her own perspective to the novel and I love the language and the plot itself. It rarely had a dull spot that didn't pertain to the plot or development of characters, which in a large book means a lot. I will admit it is more for women than men, but I think everyone can take something from this book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"When my mom gave me this book to read, I wasn't interested at first. But once I started reading it pulled me in. I am 14 and could relate to the trials and tribulations of the four Price daughters. It really made me thankful for the easy life I lead and it opened my eyes to the problems and poor conditions that so many of the world's citizens must live with. Not only did I learn about some of the excesses of our society, I also got an in-depth history lesson on the shoddy decolonization of Africa and the situations that occured because of it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is by far Kingsolver's best novel. I could not put the book down because for the first time since reading Irving's, &quot;A Prayer for Owen Meany&quot; I felt truly attached to a character. Kingsolver does a phenomenol job of conveying the hopes and fears of not only one, but five women. Each woman has her own voice and helps the reader to understand the desperate situation she is in. You can't help but feel a connection to each one. That isn't the only strength of this work. Kingsolver is also able to shed some light on the fanatical side of religion and how scary it can be when used for self-serving purposes. Being exposed to a continent of people who are so often misundestood and unfairly judged is also refreshing. I wish there were more novels out there that were not only enjoyable to read, but also educational. This is one of an elite class of novels which I truly wish I would have never had to finish..."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Exquisite. Humbling. Overwhelming. Ms. Kingsolver thrusts both hands into the deep, slithering, breathing, convulsive tilth that is Africa and shapes it into a beautiful tale I'm still savoring. I opened this book with quite different views than I possessed at the finish. I am amazed by my own ignorance; just when I think I understand this wonderful, frightening, burdensome world, I find something like this book that throws me back on my heels. If you liked Out of Africa, read this book. Perhaps Ms. Dinesen and Ms. Kingsolver have vastly different views--one having been a colonial herself--but the _language_, the imagery--my God! The only lull for me was toward the end, in Leah's political themes, and that was mainly because I don't know that much about the Congo's history or how it involves America. Bewildering and changing and full of revelations, however. What are you waiting for? Read the book!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book really rings true with those of us who have lived abroad-- not true in the sense of the same experiences, but true in the sense of the *kinds* of experiences one has abroad, and the principles and lessons each person extrapolates from those experiences. This book is unbelievably insightful, directing all of us to look inside of our selves and really think about who we are and what we are about: on the subjects of Western elitism, how we treat the handicapped, how we view the religious and cultural practices of our neighbors, etc. But, as the character Rachel vividly displays, there are individuals in this world who will never, ever, ever understand their cultural inappropriateness. All in all, a wonderful book, and a captivating manner in which to learn about the Congo."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I grew up in Africa and have also spent a third of my life in America. I read TPB on the plane as I flew out of Africa for the last time. (Ive finally immigrated to Canada). I laughed out loud and cried all the way across the Atlantic. This book has captured the various lenses outsiders use to observe Africa to try and understand the harshness and beauty of it. I would agree that it gives a politically correct, third world view of America. But I have found these views useful in challenging my own life and what it stands for. I think those views are very useful for contemplating the future of the first world, particularly as the first world becomes more diverse and takes in more third world people.Having said that, I also think this book is not as politically corrrect as other reviewers believe. It actually shows why Africa spits out anyone coming to its land in the past 5oo years. I do not think any second generation American would accept being told that they are not American. Yet, I am told I am not African - even though I was born and raised there - because of the colour of my skin. I sadly accept it and Barbara captures all of my reasoning for giving up my heritage exquisitely in her book. Written from the depths of her heart."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver's \\"Poisonwood Bible\\" is a book that must be read by all generations. Through her memorable characters Adah, Leah, Rachel, Ruth May and Orleana Price, the author portrayed a vivid description of Africa that many of us are not aware of from our cushy living style. Like the ever-thoughtful Adah felt so deeply, if only we could get rid of all the cruelties of religions and colonial ghosts from our civilizations, the world would have been a very sane place indeed.Poisonwood Bible reads like a poetry, with its description of historical injustice deep in the heart of Africa for so many years: the sufferings of Belgian Congolese, and the mind-boggling corruption of the ruling class of Congo, whose puppet leader was a thug and thief named Mobutu who was busy in building his luxurious palaces by devouring the entire international aide by himself and sharing with his partners of loots; story of Patrice Lumumba, the first democratically elected leader of Congo who was overthrown and murdered just because he envisioned a truly independent Congo devoid of any foreign intervention, and the zeal and vigor of Anatole, the Congolese and Leah, the American to live their married life in war savaged Africa and fight the corrupted regime in their own way are all worth the whole five hundred plus pages of this book.And then there is Ruth May, like the eyes of a tree, she watches over the convulsion of our world as a loving goddess would have done, not the violent God that apparently have always jolted us with His thunderous struck. The first part of the book was a discovery through the eyes of four sisters and their mother, a strange Africa they never envisioned in their dreams when they left America with their rigid father and husband \\"Tata Price\\". And the invasion of ants to clean off all the crumbs and leftover of the world in a vicious march are so vivid and descriptive, you will be looking at ants in different way after reading this. The word \\"Bangala\\" and \\"Muntu\\" have different meanings in Kikongo/Kilanga language depending on how the words have been said, and yet, the universal meaning of love and compassion is unmistaken in this awesome book by one of the Greatest American Authors of our generation, Barbara Kingsolver."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"While on a larger scale, this book was about the independence of the Belgian Congo, at its heart, it pleads for the independence of the human spirit. It is all about rising above oppressors, be they real or imagined, alive or dead. The author is able to portray, in vivid detail, how each person in this book is able to cope with their individual demons in their own unique way.The style of writing was risky, in my opinion, but fit so well with the characters in this story. For example, we never see things from Nathan's perspective, but of course this story is not about him but the effect he had on others. Also, Kingsolver is able to narrate for each of the characters so exquisitely, not by which words she uses, but the way she uses them. I also found it interesting that we were led through the story by Orleanna until the death of Ruth May, when we no longer hear her voice. This had a profound way of making the reader feel even more deeply for the personal struggles that character was dealing with after the death. Lastly, we also do not hear from Ruth May again until the end, when the family seems to have made some sort of peace with her death.This novel was incredibly moving, with beautiful and horrifying descriptions."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The growing legion of feminist writers are taking us along some disturbing paths. Earlier demands for 'equality' have been replaced by the 'FemiNazis' approach of judging and condemning men who are denied a defensive voice. Historically, male writers may have overlooked or patronized women, but rarely presented them as arch-villains. Kingsolver assembles four daughters and a wife as Star Chamber prosecutors sitting in judgment of man selling Jesus in the Congolese jungle. Dragged from Eisenhower's America to an African village, the wife and girls heap scorn on Nathan Price for his failure to comprehend the new setting while they deftly learn to cope. Closing the last page brought disappointment at not learning the motivation for Price's bizarre behaviour. What torments drove him to such a narrow outlook and single-mindedness? The sliver of evidence about Bataan was grossly inadequate. It's tempting to contend Kingsolver can't grasp a male viewpoint.Fortunately, this book has too many redeeming features to condemn it for feminist bias alone. Kingsolver's descriptive powers are a seductive force. They lead the reader from the narrow personal issues expressed Orleanna and her daughters to the weltanschauung of America's imperialism. From the abrupt culture clash opening the story, Kingsolver goes on to grant Orleanna and her four daughters an increasing sense of African realities. Their growing awareness raises the stress between Nathan and his brood. He cannot perceive what they learn - Nathan's dogmatism has no place on this stage. They find ways to circumvent his rigidity, even his favourite draws away from him over a question of survival. Finally, the loss of one of them triggers the diaspora of the rest. Nathan is abandoned to continue his failed mission.The real missionary here isn't Nathan Price, however. It's Barbara Kingsolver. Using the Price family to portray the spectrum of American views of other cultures, she strives to educate Americans about the follies of their own self-righteousness. Aware that the phrase 'globalization' is but flimsy camouflage for &quot;Americanization&quot;, Kingsolver fathoms the resentment of the Kilangan villagers toward Nathan as a small symptom. It is an example of the growing enmity of the remainder of the world to Americans imposing on other cultures. Kingsolver uses the later lives of the daughters as an observation platform to make today's generation of Americans aware of the legacy of missionarying geopolitics. Nathan comes to a fiery end. Will Americans come to understand why their ships and embassies are bombed? These are but sparks heralding a greater conflagration to come. Given the overwhelming power America exercises, there will be no trial weighing its transgressions. But there will be judgments.Self-righteousness clouds vision and judgment; Kingsolver's effort, beautifully crafted as it is, may be lost on those who most need to perceive it. If the general tone of the reviews here is representative, her powers of description may have overwhelmed the message. Pity, it's a message that needs to be heard clearly. Recent political events suggest too few are listening."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I was really impressed with this book. It was my first experience with Kingsolver, and I was riveted. The technique of allowing each of the five women to have chapters of their own was wonderful, especially since the father, who as the driving force of the family made them all go there, had no voice at all! It was like he was the eye of the hurricane: empty promises, zero understanding of the situation around him (whether of his own family or of the Congo), and an all-consuming, petty fury about his inability to be anything other than human. That his very presence (but not his impact) evaporates in the middle of the novel reveals things about his continuing ability to affect his family regardless of whether he is there to abuse them or not.I loved Kingsolver's discussion of local languages (and the way the father kept saying &quot;Jesus is poisonwood&quot; instead of what he really intended), and the way certain phrases leaped right off the page (&quot;I stir in bed and the memories rise out of me like a buzz of flies from a carcass&quot;). It was great reading -- I'd recommend it to all my friends except that they've all already read it and told me I shouldn't pick up another book until I've read this one."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I thought this book was just amazing. For me, a good book is separated from a great book by four things: story, writing style, what I learn while I am reading it, and pace. The Poisonwood Bible gets 5 stars from me on all counts.The story here is intricate, interesting, and cleverly told. The writing style is like a rich, luxurious tapestry, made so especially since there are 5 different voices narrating the tale. I learned so much about the Congo, its traditions, roots, and struggles. I loved despising Reverend Price, and all his abysmally misguided,bigoted religious buffoonery. I did not want to put this book down. I savored every moment I was reading it.Although there are lots of good books out there, true gems like the Poisonwood Bible are harder to find. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"A plot summary doesn't do this FANTASTIC novel justice. If you want synopsis, read the critics, if you want an honest, just-finished-it-minutes-ago opinion, I say WOW. Of all Kingsolver's work, this is, by far, her finest work. She combines riveting plot with unique literary style and lush settings. This is a book that will stay with you for days, weeks, to come. Astounding!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"When I first read about what Kingsolver's new book was about, I wasn't thrilled with the subject matter. But I have read all her other books so I thought, why not? I couldn't have been more surprised. I loved this book, couldn't put it down and will recommend it to everyone I know! I loved the different characters telling of the story and I learned a lot about the Congo (I knew nothing before). This is a wonderful book that I haven't stopped thinking about -- it's a book that you're sad to have end, a rarity these days."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This novel is quite a departure from Kingsolver's previous work, and the subject matter more difficult, but after the first chapter, it was thoroughly engaging."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is by far Kingsolver's best work. The character are multi-layered as is the novel. The imagery of the plants and animals is much more vivid than in the previous novels. I would agree that the latter portion of the book is too overtly political and if this is ever brought to the screen (which I believe it WILL be) I wouldn't be surprised to see the movie end when the mother and daughters leave the village."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"While she tells a mildly interesting yarn about a missionary's family, Kingsolver approaches the complexities that are Africa in an insultingly patronizing way. She draws on the &quot;noble save&quot; theory of Rousseau and romantically glosses over what corrupt and vicious Marxist governments have done to the people of this beseiged continent in the last few decades.Pure pap."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book was recommended to me by a counselor and I certainly hope the intention was not to connect me in any way with the pathetic character of Rev. Price. This book \\"may\\" have shed some light on the plight of the Congolese and behind-the-scenes corruption of governments, but as far as a novel is concerned it was a redundant, fatalistic, twisted disaster. The children's characters were inconsistent and didn't come close to matching their age level thinking. The mother was the most negative, fatalistic, and mentally ill character I've ever seen. It scares me for the writer who could even imagine such a person. I also agree with some of the other commentors regarding the Baptist references. I grew up an Independent Baptist and NO Baptist would ever use the Apocrypha! Indeed, we were told all Catholics were going straight to hell. And almost no Baptist preacher would be Pentecostal. And no Baptist preacher would see any need to baptise infants or children. To create such a mean and unfeeling man who was totally oblivious to the culture and totally insensitive to the feelings of others indicates a serious ingrained bitterness towards the Church and/or clergy on the part of the author. (And then to have him burned at the end! Sick!)Not that such a character didn't deserve it, but the question is: does such a character even come close to reality for ANY pastor? This does a serious disservice to Christianity in general! As I said before, I suspect loads of bitterness on the part of the author and reading this book was very depressing!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I would recommend this book as a source for intereting information about Africa, but if you appreciate nuanced characters and a realistic plot, I wouldn't waste my time with this book.I enjoyed some of Kingsolver's previous novels, but I found this book to be completely phony. Each person in this book seems to be not a character but a mouthpiece to demonstrate &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil.&quot; The good characters (Leah) respect different cultures and adapt to them, while the bad characters (the father, Rachel) are racist and provincial. It is very simplistic. Because I couldn't relate to the pure good or evil of any of the characters, I wasn't much interested in their story. It just seemed to be trying too hard."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I've heard from many people that this is a book you either love, or hate. For me, I just couldn't get into it. My friend, a big reader, told me that this book was one of her \\"all time favorites\\". With such a fabulous referral, I had to read it.The story seems interesting: A Southern pastor and his family travel on a mission to the Congo. I kept reading, thinking that I would become captured if I just read a few pages more. One hundred pages into the book, however, I finally gave up.My advice is to probably give this book a try. There are many people that loved it. I'm just one of those that didn't."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I am usually really into Barbara Kingsolver's fiction. But for the sheer reason of boredom, I couldn't get past the 4th chapter. She tells the same details over and over again with a different character's voice. I tried REALLY hard, but this didn't do it for me. This is a book for devoted Kingsolver fans who want to read it just for that or for the hype that it got from Oprah. Depressing subject matter, drawn out story, and a whole lot of foreshadowing without much action."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver's THE POISONWOOD BIBLE is a mesmerizing narrative spanning about 40 years, chronicling the clash of African and Western history and culture by narrating the adventures of the Price family.The book starts in 1959, with arrogant, fiery Baptist Preacher Nathan Price taking his docile wife and 4 engaging daughters from Bethlehem, Georgia to the village of Kilanga in the jungle of the Congo, to do the Lord's work of converting the heathen to Christianity. The Price family's tragic, but often amusing, adventures are narrated by Orleanna Price, Nathan's docile and long suffering wife, and her 4 daughters: beautiful but shallow Rachel, tomboyish but devoted Leah, the brooding lame genius Adah and headstrong child Ruth May.Rather than spread the glory of God, Nathan and his family cause many misunderstandings and face spectacular setbacks in a brutal landscape with people of vastly different beliefs and customs. Their garden of Eden fails to grow fruit but grows poisonwood, their cake mixes turn into rock, they suffer from malaria, depression and curses from the village chief and the local witch doctor, are bitten by mambas and (nearly) eaten by lions, and watch as Lord Jesus is democratically voted out of office in a Church election.Although they spend but 2 years in Kilanga, their stay here indelibly marks the lives of all five women: Orleanna's tragic loss finally gives her the strength to leave her abusive husband but leaves her grasping for forgiveness for the next 40 years. Rachel learns that fairy tales and princes don't exist, so she must learn to trust herself; she becomes self-sufficient and wealthy from running a resort. Leah losses all faith in Christianity and in her home country of America; she lives a life of struggle and poverty in Africa and dreams of a better world for her Congolese husband and children. Adah overcomes her physical handicap and her long sense of victimhood; she becomes a respected virologist who sees a world of balance among all living creatures. Ruth May fades and disappears to join the wise world of the Muntu: the world of all that was and is, all that is here.As gripping as this novel is, it is not without flaws. The novel works best when it tightly focuses on the adventures of the Price family. While it cannot be denied that historical events of the Congo played a major role in the lives of these women, Kingsolver at times lets go of their adventure altogether and starts narrating Congolese, or African history. As other reviewers mention, Kingsolver is not a historian, and her historical analysis is short sighted and lacks complexity- it is mostly a politically correct version of the rape and pillage of poor innocent Africa and Africans by evil Westerners. While the West certainly has caused enormous problems in Africa, Kingsolver's simplistic analysis ignores African agency (and thus mistakes) and thus is ultimately condescending for all parties.Related is Kingsolver's penchant for preaching morals through her characters. Although fully realized characters in any novel need to have moral reactions and reflections to events around them, Kingsolver often goes overboard. At times, the characters literally (sometimes condescendingly) lecture the reader on Africa and morality: Orleanna: It would have been best if Africa and the West had never met. All Westerners can never be forgiven for all our sins. Rachel: Africa is a dark land where life roars by in a flood, the best one can do to stick out ones elbows and get carried though the current-you have to save your own neck. Leah: America and the west are all always evil rapists of innocent Africa, which is always good and can do no wrong. Communism is good. The Congolese should return to the simplistic lifestyle of the fairy-tale like Kingdom of the Kongo. Adah: Worms, viruses and humans are all equal and have the same rights- this is exemplified by 'harsh' life in the Congo. Get over your feelings of human superiority. Ruth May: Being dead is the same as being alive. Sins are shared by all, so forgive yourself and others and walk into the light.Unfortunately, none of these simplistic moral messages are really convincing- the book would have been stronger if us readers were allowed to decipher moral messages for ourselves.Still, despite its flawed entries into history and morality, THE POISONWOOD BIBLE is a powerful work. It brings the troubled historical clash of the West and Africa (especially in the Congo) into the public spotlight, and, when focusing on the Price family, it does so in a very personal manner. It forces deep reflection, and can thus serve as a bridge for reconciliation and healing."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I thoroughly enojoyed Barbara Kingsolver's, The Poisonwood Bible and reccommend it to any reader who is up for the challege of a thought provoking, epic novel. The story touches on the issues of religous faith, racism, independence, and the struggle of survival in the Congolese Jungle and within a deterioating family structure. I found it interesting that the author chose to write the book from the perspective of the young girls, sometimes the mother, and never the father. I am still left questioning his thoughts, actions and reactions to most of the issues in the story from him and not how the young girls or his wife perceived his reactions to certain situations. I suppose that is what makes the novel so interesting and thought provoking because I am still thinking about it. One of the issues bothering me is that Nathan Price was only armed with the knowledge of God's word to take on the challeges of he and his family surviving in the Congolese Jungle of Africa. I believe he should have been better prepared in a &quot;McGuyver&quot; kind of way to keep his family fed and somewhat cared for. Mr. Price's solution to everything was to pray about it! He left the daily responsibilities of surviving to his wife and young daughters. It would not have hurt him to carry a container of water up from the river once in a while. Irritating! However, in the early 1960's American women were more apt to obey the man of the house and follow his lead. Women were not allowed to have a voice as we know still exists today in some countries. I believe this story also represents the survival and triumph of women. Faith is still intact for those that believe and have the freedom to do so in any manner they choose. It is a wonderful novel of fiction and I love the discussions it prompts with fellow readers."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I wavered between three and four stars for this book. Three seemed too low because the story really affected me. Most of the characters moved me in some way. I despised Nathan. Rachel was annoying and funny. Leah impressed and dissapointed me. Ruth May was charming and brought me sorrow. Orleanna frustrated me. I identified with Adah and loved her quirky mind. This took some writing talent on Kingsolver's part. Also, the book educated me on things many white self-absorbed Americans are ignorant to. It also made me examine my race, my country and my family. My stepfather is related to Dwight Eisenhower and I was raised to think he was a hero. After reading this book, I realize my parents idolize him with unquestioning ignorance.Four stars seemed too high a rating because the book was long. It rambled in parts, especially in the end. I was left with questions, though I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing to be left with questions after completing a book. But it took a while for things to wind down in the end.I recommend this challenging and thought provoking book. Be prepared for the emotional/educational impact about 3/4 through."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The book is about Nathan a damaged man. During the war Nathan was a marine and he suffered an injury during the Philippines campaign. His injury meant that he was hospitalised and thus saved from the Bataan Death March something he irrationally blames himself for. To overcome his guilt he becomes a missionary to the Belgian Congo, not for the Baptist Church of which he is a member but as part of the Belgian missionary structure. The coming independence for the Congo has made it hard for the Belgians to find missionaries.Nathan's inner demons prevent him understanding or coming to grips with the world and the village in which he preaches. His predecessor was a Catholic Priest who unlike Nathan studied the people in the village and got to know the villagers as friends. One of the unforgettable scenes in the novel is when this former priest returns and talks to Nathan's wife and daughters. He reveals the village head not as a caricature sitting in front of his house wearing glass frames without lenses, a figure of fun, but as a responsible man who tries to run the village in a fair way and to deal with the issues faced by its people. The local witch doctor is a compassionate wise man who listens to the woes of the villagers and tries to help them by giving sensible advice. In fact the witch doctor feels sorry for Nathan and has a far greater understanding of him as a man than Nathan has of any of the villagers. The Catholic priest unlike Nathan tried to work out the way of the village and to develop a bond with each member. Because he was able to reduce the incidence of wife beating he became popular with the women of the village and made converts.To Nathan the natives are savages not humans and he can only rave at them. A few people come to his services they are the people who are shunned by the village such as lepers. Nathan has no idea of why even these people come. He just has a sense of failure, something he can't understand as his faith suggests that he should be successfully.The mechanics of the book are to have the narrative carried by the wife and daughters of Nathan. The interlocking narrative gradually gives us a picture of the village and the reason for Nathan's failure and his growing madness. As he descends further into his own selfish world his family are left behind to suffer more and more as they are left in a world that is disintegrating. The only possible critism of this book is that the stories of the daughters is perhaps a little unrealistic as they are so perceptive. This however is the most minor of critisms.I have never read anything by this writer before but the writing seems effortless and the intelligence and grasp of the real world is amazing. It is also pleasing to see a novel written about something important rather than the sensibilities of the middle class."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kingsolver's Poisonwood Bible may not be her best work, but if you hang in there for awhile, you'll find the same character development and character voice you loved in Animal Dreams.Kingsolver is fabulous at giving her characters a voice--remember Cody in Animal Dreams? Sorting out the many narrators and understanding their voice in Poisonwood takes awhile, but the journey is worth it.A friend of mine who has spent many years in Africa found each characters' reaction to the sometimes horrific events of the book to be real. With Africa and all that was happening when the book is set, you either groove into it and stay like Leah, are changed forever like Adah, pretend it never happened like Rachel and the mother, or you don't make it out alive, like little Ruth May and the tyrannical father.Although I find Kingsolver's politics obvious (and similar to my own), I think even the most conversative may find it gives them something to think about.Not bad for a piece of fiction."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book was often hard to get through because of the cruelty of the father, Baptist missionary Nathan Price. But by the end of the book, I felt as though I had been devastated and then rebuilt, like the Price family and like the Congo itself. I felt like I had been somewhere I had never been. I also began feeling incredibly grateful for things I take for granted every day--food, clothing, shelter, doctors, etc. I thought about this book, its characters, and the ramifications of their actions, for days after I finished it. It's not for everyone, but I hope you try it out anyway. It just might affect you profoundly."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I found this book exhausting, irritating and preachy. I slogged through it as I felt compelled to learn about the fates of these four women. Kingsolver is a talented author but this work is burdened by her obsession with a social justice agenda."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"By far the best novel of the year, Kingsolver's Poisonwood Bible is not only her best work yet, but it is also the best book I've read in years (and I read a lot!). The story starts off a bit slowly, but soon you will find yourself attached to the characters and emotionally involved in the text. I seriously could not put it down. Don't let the general subject (the lives of a mother and her four daughters doing mission work in Africa) scare you off. Kingsolver's story is simultaneously beautiful and treacherous, joyous and heart-wrenching, complex and yet wonderfully simple. Reading it is doing yourself a favor. If you liked her other works, you MUST read this. If you've never read Kingsolver before, read this and become a devoted fan."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible, the tale of a missionary and his family in Africa, did not initially appeal to me, but I agreed to read it for my book club. I have a great love of language, especially writing, but I found the opening chapter confusing. Yet my initial skepticism was quickly overcome by the unique structure of the book with each chapter alternately told by one of the four sisters in a manner that was effective in contrasting their different personalities and points of view about their common experiences during their first two years in Africa. These chapters passed quickly for me, and I was through most of the book in just a few days --- greatly enjoying learning about the African culture and being enlightened about the terrible consequences of colonialism. I became impatient, however, with the last fourth of the book in which months and then years passed between chapters. In the end, I came away with a great admiration for Ms. Kingsolver's technical skill in alternately using four main voices to tell her story. But as I thought longer, I felt that the four voices were simply highly effective fictional tools to relate the great political and social injustice that has occurred in the former Belgian Congo during and since colonialism. The book's four main voices and other characters served as a means to a political and social cause. Some, Leah, Adah, Ruth Ann, were better drawn than others, Axelroot, Nathan, Rachel. The latter were largely one-dimensional counterpoints representing the evil, wrong-minded religious righteousness, or vacuousness of western culture, but in the end, none truly were believable human characters."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book was probably the best I have read in the past few years! Though long, it was difficult to put down. I found the beginning sections humorous (sometimes in a sad way). The middle to end chapters moved me to tears frequently - I needed to put the book down a few times in order to recover from the emotional impact. The writing from the perspective of each main character (except the missionary? ) was fascinating, amusing, and informing. I can't put more into words, except that I absolutely loved this book. For anyone who has a little child (as I do), be prepared to be moved very deeply."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"For those who have been asking since Sept. 11 why so many people in the world hate Americans, The Poisonwood Bible gives several compelling reasons. Kingsolver gives a stark picture of U.S. involvement in Africa, how we have tried to impose our religion on others and how the U.S. government and western countries have historically exploited the natural resources of third-world countries without, in turn, helping them to improve their lives. The story is entertaining and a wonderful study of perspective--told through the keen eyes of four daughters and a wife of a Baptist missionary who are sent to Africa to &quot;save the natives.&quot; I heartily recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I had never read any books by Kingsolver before this one, and I have to say she is a wonderful and gifted writer. The Poisonwood Bible is a great novel, different from anything I've ever read before. I enjoyed the contrasting accounts of Congo life told by each girl. However, I felt this book was too long. After their mission in the Congo, I felt I wasn't as interested as before. I like to hear what happens to the characters after ordeals such as theirs, but it just dragged on for me. It became very political and symbolic in the end and I got somewhat confused. Other than this, the novel was expertly written and I am glad I took the time to read it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This was my favorite books of 1998. Although everyone sort of washed out in the end, I loved how the story was told through the family members. I could imagine my reactions in this political and primitive situation."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"As a high school librarian, i am always looking for a quality novel that students will enjoy and learn something. This novel is destined to be on high school reading lists in the years to come... so well written and intensely interesting...the kind of book that makes a person want to find another good book to read...."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I think, although the book was very long (narrative flow could have used some work) and Kingsolver has written more elegantly before, it had some really interesting aspects. The main thing that sticks in my mind is the technique; Rev. Price, the man around whom the story turns, is described obliquely by the people who surround him. This is a very effective way of telling the story, as it emphasizes the unbridgeable gap between the minds of the Prices. This is the same way that Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury works, by weaving a story around Caddy Compson. While Kingsolvers book is not as cleanly written as Faulkner's, ultimately it is almost as devastating."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The setting is the Belgian Congo as it approached independence; the characters are white baptists transplanting themselves in the jungle to spread &quot;the good news&quot;. Although there is an adventure about all of this, the book is a commentary about many things:race,women,slavery(physical and psychological),men, cultures classing, politics, God and religion.Whether you agree with the commentary or not, it is all quite thought provoking. Although not as powerfully written as Toni Morrison's &quot;Beloved&quot;, this novel is a more gracefull counterpart in the discussion of the human condition and human interaction.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"It has been a long time since I had a book that I couldn't put down, but this one took care of that. I loved the style in which the author chose to tell this powerful story. I had my favorites among the daughters and looked forward to their chapters and point of view. I recommended this to all my friends and to their bookclubs."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I've found out a lot of things, practically the entire different view I've thought of. Democracy for instant, the majority wins is a concept I longed as the best system in the world. Poisonwood bible shook me out of it, telling that it only stands on two legs! Which come to think of it, a very true and wise word.But it's not just that part, the allegories each characters represented in such true manner you want to shout out telling the world about what's wrong with everybody around us!It's a true gift to experience her novel, in such short notive, I've finished the book with delighted ideas and much more mature thinking. Ever wonder why Christianity failed in Africa? Because it's a complete different thing, same as how we could not accept their beliefs.Try this book. I think it's worthy to understand Africa much more complex system than we ever know of people dancing around naked doing the Ooga-ooga."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Overall the book is excellent but other then a diatribe against Western policies toward Africa, the second half really did not add to the book, it just made it longer....She should have wrapped up the book with an epilogue or a couple of summary chapters on how things turned out....Nonetheless, a fine book"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Pick up this novel only if you've got time to commit to it; by the time I was halfway through it, I often found myself staring at my computer screen at work, thinking about &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; instead of the reports I was supposed to edit. Kingsolver is a master at snaring you slowly and gently, though her detailed, straightforward, and factual prose seems to belie any trickery. Well-researched, informative, fascinating; a story of the decay of an American family, a struggle to come to terms with religion and women's place in the world, and surprising insights on race relations and democracy -- that somehow manages to give an astonishingly full worm's-eye view of the civil wars in the Congo."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is Barbara Kingsolver at her best. A fascinating story told through the eyes of 4 young girls and their mother. Kingsolver knows her subject - the Belgian Congo in the 60's - and is a master at keeping the reader's interest piqued while at the same time showing us history. Often we see the same scene through different eyes and this is when the novel is most compelling. The author's skill keeps each chapter in perfect voice of the character who's eyes we are using. I loved this book and can't wait until until Kingsolver treats us to another novel."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I guess I expected a lot more from this book,as I did like her earlier books. I found the characters inane, the writing poor, and very annoying with her cutsie on-purpose mistakes like &quot;Thyroid Mary&quot; and the stupid palindromes. Enough already, stop trying so hard as just tell the story."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"It took three tries to get through the first 90 pages but after Genesis, I was transfixed. I thought about things I'd never thought about...as far as I'm concerned, this is a must read for anyone who takes reading and great writing seriously. I intend to read this again and again..."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I read this book after I moved to Africa, and as an expatriate American, I felt especially attuned to the feelings of the women in this missionary family when they left their safe American home and moved to a remote part of the Congo. The turns, changes, and horrors of their lives, including how the father figure affected each of the women, touched me greatly. Kingsolver's use of all the women's voices to tell the story, though initially confusing, brought great depth to the book. I could not put this one down, and since having read it, I have read three others by Kingsolver, all of which I would recommend (Bean Tree, Prodigal Summer, and one other)."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book was one of those you can't put down. It made me apprecitate how life in the USA is alot easier than in Africa. The end kind of got slow, but overall, I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I enjoyed this book up until about 80% through it. Basically, I thought at first that I would completely hate it since it was about religion and about Africa - both of which frankly don't usually interest me. However, I found it captivating and intriguing. I was addicted and read it non-stop. ... That is, until the main story ended and the &quot;aftermath&quot; story began. Then, the book lost it's magic and lost what made it so captivating to begin with.The first 80% of the book was tremendous - deep, beautiful and just grand. The different conflicts that were going on - between husband and wife, children and parents, and community and preacher are just terrific.Some other reviewers call this book &quot;male bashing&quot; - I don't quite see that one. I guess the antagonist happens to be male and a wife does battle her husband, but I don't think I would characterize it as &quot;male bashing.&quot;My recommendation is to read the book. However, be aware that the interest may be lost after a certain time."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"If you like to escape in your books, this one definitely takes you &quot;away&quot;. If you like a happy story, run far, far away. If you read books looking to learn anything of value, you'll be able to squeeze some life lessons out of it. If you had a strict or super-conservative upbringing, you'll identify with it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I first heard about Barbara Kingsolver from a favorite cousin and, within a very short time, had managed to read all of her books that the local library had to offer. My first impression was that she had a lot of potential but wasn't quite &quot;there&quot; yet. Although I enjoyed her writing, it seemed to lack endings and continuity and connections. Then, I ran across &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; and I got it. In her forward, Barbara states that she had been thinking, studying and working on this book for a very long time. &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; is just about perfection for this reader. Not all writers have to invest the time and toil that this book involved to create a great read, but that is what this book had to have to be what it is. It's been a very, very long time since I have read a book that grabbed me the way this one did. I hope I don't have to wait as long to find my next near-perfect book. Barbara Kingsolver, I am truly impressed."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I don't know really what I was expecting from this book and it was a little slow to start, but soon discovered myself pulled in and enjoying every page of it! I thought the story was well-told and kept my interest. The format added to the story as well...getting to hear various sides of the story from different characters was a unique way to go, but effective and gave the feeling at times that you were flipping through different books. This was especially true as time went on and the family members all parted ways. I'd recommend it definitely, but would warn that you need to push through the first few chapters to really get into the story."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I am a big fan of Kingsolvers work, but was hesitant to try this book. It seemed too different from her novels I had recently read. Once I started reading though, I could not stop! You get to know the characters so well, whether you like them or not, you are truly attatched to them by the end of the book. Her writing is so detailed and full of humor that you start reading slower so the book will last longer. I know this will be a book I will never get rid of. You can read it over and over again, its that good."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"In \\"The Poisonwood Bible,\\" Barbara Kingsolver executes satisfactorily the essential elements of a provocative story: satisfying character development, suspense, and attention to detail. The four daughters in her story, Rachel, Leah, Adah, and Ruth May, have distinct voices and successfully serve as foils and mirrors against each other. All of them reflect pieces that can be found in many of us.Rachel is the unabashed American, representative of American culture at its worst and most self-absorbed. Because Kingsolver portrays her with such compassionate humor, Rachel allows us to see ourselves in her, without the need to put up our defenses and shun that aspect of ourselves that resides in many of us. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross in her autobiography, \\"The Wheel of Life,\\" writes of her realization at the end of World War II that \\"there is a Hitler in all of us.\\" So, too, is there the potential for a Rachel in all of us, as Kingsolver illustrates in her contemporary journey into Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness.\\"In contrast, it is pure joy and discovery to watch Leah develop over the course of the novel. Indeed, all of the daughters develop, deepen, and mature over time. Their experience in Africa changes their lives, as it hopefully will yours, too, when you read this novel. \\"Love changes everything,\\" says the voice of Leah. Indeed, it does; her love for Africa lost, as well as Kingsolver's, changes everything. You cannot escape this novel without having gained a greater compassion for the tragedy that is Africa, the richness that has been exploited. Yet this is not a sentimental, nave, or simplistic, knee-jerk-liberal perspective of Africa. Kingsolver's portrait is rich in complexity and depth. It is through the different characters' eyes that the complexity of Africa and its history are revealed. In particular, Leah's return to America, when she stands inside a supermarket and experiences wonderment, anger, and shame, should resonate with anyone who has lived outside the US, as it certainly did with me.Adah, too, develops in a surprisingly revealing way. Adah, physically injured at birth and emotionally injured growing up in the United States, illustrates with perfect clarity our culture's discomfort with differences. In Africa, however, her physical \\"abnormality\\" fits right in, and it is her \\"perfect\\" sisters who stand in stark contrast to the maimed natives for whom no modern medical care is available. How Adah resolves and makes peace with her physical and emotional situations is one of the most satisfying discoveries revealed in the novel. Adah is tempted with the opportunity for romance, once she discovers that she is healed. When she discovers, however, that it is only her healed, perfect self that is acceptable to her potential lover, rather than her imperfect self, she rejects the opportunity to thus deny this very real part of herself. So, too, will Africa be acceptable and righted to us, only when it \\"cleans up its act\\" and behaves in a \\"civilized\\" manner? Or can we accept Africa in its blackness, its stark contrast to our blonde whiteness, with its warts and all, and what it mirrors to us about our own warts?Adah's poetic voice is pure joy and beauty to read. Her poetry reveals the language that resides inside of all of us, if only we listen to it and refuse to be distracted by the sounds of our own voices. By not being able to talk as a child, Adah is permitted to develop a rich, though dark, inner voice. The darkness of her poetry also reveals the deep necessity of relationship among us. Because Adah, like many of us, has no one to discuss with and thereby work through her disturbing inner thoughts-her dark side, like Africa's, is shunned in the \\"Land of General Electric\\"-she does not begin to find resolution until \\"the Exodus,\\" when she is forced to make a positive choice for herself. \\"The Exodus\\" is Adah's turning point, when she ceases to see herself as baggage heaped upon her family, and begins to take responsibility for her own life. So, too, at the time of the Exodus--the Congo's independence--the Congo ceases to be the \\"white man's burden\\" and begins to come into its own.But \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" is not merely a story of compassion for Africa. Expect to be angered when you read this story. Readers familiar with Kingsolver's earlier works will recognize her anger at having been betrayed in her benevolent trust of this country's elected public officials and the arrogance of their actions. This anger over betrayal, as well as the poetic voice revealed in Adah, can be found also in her collection of poetry, \\"Another America.\\"Reading \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" reawakened my curiosity surrounding the circumstances of the death of Dag Hammarskj&ouml;ld, the UN Secretary General who died while assisting independence negotiations in the Congo. I have since begun reading Brian Urquhart's biography, \\"Hammarskjold,\\" as well as Michael Wrong's new book, \\"In the Footsteps of Mr. Kurtz.\\" Both have added more dimension to the continuing story of the Congo."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I am sorry, but anyone giving this book any less than five stars should have his/her head examined. I just finished this book and it was absolutely perfect. Kingsolver has a true gift for storytelling, and quite frankly, I am always impressed with an author who can write in multiple narratives.Not only was this one of the most entertaining books I have ever read, but I \\"believed\\" every word of it. Who can resist the tale of misguided Christian missionaries living in the Congo to proselytize the \\"dark continent\\"? This is a story packed full of accidental adventure and gorgeous prose. I could not recommend it more highly.I am a student of literature and therefore have run into a lot of snobs out there who look down their noses at \\"Oprah books,\\" but if you ask me, the woman knows how to pick 'em. This story is a paragon of great storytelling. Period.Read this book today; you will become a Kingsolver fan for life."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Seriously, this book is incredible. It is one of those novels that educates and draws out that part of you that wants to change the world, that feels ashamed of sitting in your house, reading fiction, instead of being out there trying to solve the worlds problems.It's just that great a book. The only other thing I can say is, read it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I loved this book and did not want it to end. When an author can take you through so many emotions, they have been successful. It took me about 75 pages before I was really into it and then I devoured it. So much of my family is from the south, so I could really appreciate the attitudes and opinions of the girls, their appearance, what to take to this unknown world and then to their tremendous shock to find they had arrived so terribly unprepared. Although sad, so much of how the girls approached each situation was funny. Each chapter is narrated by one of each of the characters which really allows you an intimate relationship with each person in the story. As a mother, it was heartwrenching for me to read of the dangers these girls were in and what resulted. As a Christian, it was disturbing for me to read of how this Baptist minister approached teaching the word of God. He did not take into account the culture he was entering giving it no heed. He seemed to be oblivious to anything accept what he wanted to accomplish. What was even more disturbing was how he treated his family. He was a terrible witness to the Lord all the way around. There was no love for his wife, his children nor for the people he came to minister to. Amazingly this mother and these girls persevered through incredibly difficult circumstances. This is my first Kingsolver novel and am curious to try another. I highly recommend this book and would love a sequel."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"As with the rest of Barbara Kingsolver's writing, I would recommend this to any adult who loves a great read. The writing is poignantly poetic, and the plot keeps you reading late into the night. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I reread this book recently. I was initially intrigued by the title. The setting of the Belgian Congo is both unique and disturbing as the missionary family is surrounded by violence due to political unrest. The varying personalities, experiences and perspectives displayed in the daughters add to the interest and complexity of the novel. Some readers may be suprised and even alarmed by the results of the father's reckless passion to follow his own beliefs and refusal to consider or incorporate the beliefs of the native people around him."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book is a sweeping tale of one family's struggle in the jungle of the Congo during the most turbulent era that country has ever gone through. The Price family sees themselves in a different light and each character changes as a result. The schtick of the book is that it is told through the perspective of the 4 daughters of the family with the occasional section written from the mother's perspective.The story introduces a number of amazing, almost unbelievable African experiences, as well as an international perspective on the US's continuing colonization. The book also allows us to look at the idea of missionary work. The father in the story is a EXTREMELY dedicated missionary and is developed almost to the point of a caricature of all things wrong missionary work being done in foreign countries. I, for one, am in favor of missionaries spreading their influence to christian leaders inside of foreign countries and letting these leaders minister through their understanding of the culture and the spiritual setting.The perspectives of each character are well written and Kingsolver does a nice job putting you in each character's situations. I truly enjoyed Orleanna's perspective throughout, and all of the others grew on me for some reason or another. Rachel became more and more outrageous, which made me appreciate the feelings Kingsolver was able to draw from me. Leah became more caring and it was good to see her move from her father's shadow. Adah became more reasonable and it was nice to see her transformation from self-hate and loathing to success. Ruth May was one of the most fun characters to read. Kingsolver wrote her very well considering for most of the story she was a small child.Overall, I would recommend this book, more so to women as it gives so many different feminine perspectives, that men like me could never truly appreciate all of its depth. Stick with this book, it takes a while to get into this, but it is well worth it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"First, let me say that I loved this book. I don't agree at all with Kingsolver's politics in the real world, but I didn't read this so much as a political novel as a novel of family relationships, and five women trying to escape their patriarchal chains (with varying degrees of success...) At first I was a little offput by the prose tics of each character, especially Adah (I admit, I kind of glossed over a lot of her backward-forward stuff), but by the end I found that the narrative effect worked. I did keep expecting to have a chapter titled \\"Nathan\\", but the book works so much better without his point of view.I have had varied reactions to other Kingsolver books--pretty much nonplussed by her earlier novels, but I really liked Prodigal Summer--but this was by far the most moving and satisfying."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Great story set in the early 1960s in the Congo. A missionary zealot leads his family into the wilderness to reclaim the souls of misguided Congolese. Boy are they in for a reality check. Kingsolver really creates great characters and helps you live through them. I listened to the unabridged audio book and really looked forward to my commute everyday to see what would happen. Most of the book focuses on the family's experience in the Congo, but about 20% of it is post-Congo following the lives of the different daughters as they grow up. Really makes you think. Highly recommended for all readers."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver has really done her research.The Poisonwood Bible focuses on a Baptist missionary who takes his four daughers (Rachel, Leah, Adah, Ruth May) and his wife, Orleanna, to the Congo, to try to save the Africans' needy souls.Of course, just writing that would not do the book any justice at all. It is one of the best works I have read in awhile.The story is narrated by Nathan's four daughters and his wife, Orleanna.They each have their own distinctive personalities: Rachel - spoiled, Leah - wants to impress her father, Adah - physically disabled, loves word play, and Ruth May - kind of naive and the baby of the family.Orleanna, too - helpless at most points in the novel.From each of their perspectives, they tell their story. How they adjust to the Congo, how they more or less have to fend for themselves.The descriptions of the Congo - how the kids and people run around naked, or with little to no clothing, the destitution the Congolese are living in, how they excrete their wastes behind bushes... everything is so authentic. The vivid, powerful descriptions will make you feel as if you're in the Congo.The Poisonwood Bible deals with religion, race, politics, sins, and many different kinds of love. Kingsolver's prose is eloquent, searing and, at times, utterly poetic. Beautiful.This is a masterpiece not to be missed. I only regret that I hadn't read it sooner. Everyone must read this book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is a great book that opens up your eyes to the lives and events of people across the world. This book is not only a fictional story about a missionary family, but a historical, biological, and cultural look at the Congo. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I can barely describe adequately the immense pleasure I derived from reading this novel--I literally could not put it down! Kingsolver does a marvelous job of bringing the characters to life and truly creates a novel that is a joy to read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I read this book before Oprah did. I loved it! It took me away from my life and took me to the Congo. Each daughter's voice took you more and more into the jungle. The time's were in the 1950/60s so women did not have a voice. But by the end they all did and what voices they had! The last chapter was read several times -- talking about forgiving and love. Excellent!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible taught readers so much about the Congo in Africa. I realized how lucky I am to live in such a rich nation. I was a little disturbed toward the middl e of the book when the father suddenly started acting more and more mean towards his family. I realized he had been a jerk through the whole book at that point. I would recommed this book to people interessted in learning the history of the Congo as well as one family's attempt to survive in the jungles of Africa. It really kept my attention and I'm sure it would keep yours too."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver is brilliant, and this is her finest work. If you liked this book, check out her earlier novel &quot;Animal Dreams&quot;."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I had been told to expect this book to be slow to begin with and then become a &quot;can't put down&quot;. I found the opposite. I immediately loved the langauge and the style of writing. I looked forward to returning to each daughter's story to get her perspective on events. It make me think about what progress and civilization are and whether one culture can determine what that is for another. And then, in the last third of the book, the author decided we just couldn't get the point without being hit in the head with a hammer. Many authors have attempted to educate westerners about the culture of others and the effect of outside interference and political policies, but they have done it in more subtle ways that really make you examine your beliefs and perspective. Does Ms. Kingsolver lack the skill or just the will? I did enjoy the writing enough to try another of her books, hopefully she'll give me the benefit of the doubt and assume I am intelligent enough to draw my own conclusions."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible was a great book. Even though it is lengthy, you will finish it in a couple days because you won't be able to put it down! After reading this book it made me think about other cultures and respecting their rituals and ways of doing things. This book also made me realize how lucky I am and that I should be more grateful for what God has given me. Great book -- everyone should read it!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the book. Kingsolver was able to write in each character's personality and appropriate vocabulary. I have recommended this book to all my friends."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I couldn't put it down. Barbara Kingsolver has written a masterpiece. Eloquent, well-put together and intense at times."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"an excellent if somewhat difficult read. The Poisonwood Bible will make you think and wonder about the lives and comfrots we all have, and it will make you cherish your loved ones even more."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I have always been a fan of Barbara Kingsolver, and I think this is her masterpiece. Obviously a lot of work went into this book. It was so insightful and enjoyable that I had to read it twice."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I've read many good books over the years, but this one fascinated me more than anything I can think of--I hated to get to the last page! The perspectives of the four uniquely different daughters was delightful and poignant but always tinged with humor and irony. It was the unraveling of a family, but was so punctuated with army ants, teen angst and palindromes that I forgot to feel weighed down by the tragedy. I'll be recommending this book for years."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I read alot of books and in all truthfulness I have never read another book like this one. Not in the plot line, which deals with the Congo and its political struggle 1960 to present and the lives of a (white) American family who come to convert the Africans to christianity. And not in the way it is written, so curiously devoid of cliches. I expected this book to be boring but instead i was drawn into the lives and the personalitites of the characters; their hopes and dreams and their heartaches; the ways in which they changed and in the ways they never wavered. Read this book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I had to invent a new word for this one. This may be one of the best books I have read in ten years. The father in this story is a zealot missionary who runs to the jungle, really to confront things that happened to him before and loses his entire family there. The history of Congo/Zaire from a different perspective is eye-opening and fabulous, and the things found in this book are enough to make any American, Black, White, blue or green, question what the news told us about 1960-80's Africa and the US, the slave trade, and race relations in general. Barbara Kingsolver also poignantly illustrates that sometimes, a person has to be stripped of all they take for granted to learn to appreciate what is true, real and necessary in life. At the end of the book, I was speechless, and up all night."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Praise, not criticism, to Barbara Kingsolver for wearing her politics on her sleeve. It's a rare gift to a reader that she can express them with such openness, pain and beauty.Having been a white African for seventeen years, I consider myself blessed to be able to read in it another dimension. With every page, my eyes were prised open a little more.Thank you!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible the superbly written book by Barbara Kingsolver is one of the best books I have read in years. Nathan Price has dreamed of going to Africa as a missionary for years and willingly has his wife and four daughters accompany him despite the risks. The book is told in five distinct voices, that of his wife and four daughters. The reader begins to know and care deeply about each child. Each is profoundly affected by Nathan and her own experience of Africa. They are faced with dangers as venomous serpents, drought, and army ants.Africa for ever alters each family member and this dysfunctional family will be forever changed. The lessons learned while coming of age in the midst of revolution are significantly different than those for middle class America. Love and beauty for each of the surviving sisters has a different meaning.This is a wonderful book crafted by an excellent author. I expected it will be required reading for years to come. It is not for everyone. I have lent it out only to have it returned unread. So considered your likes in reading material. It is lengthy. The second half of the book moves at a slower pace than the first. There are those who may disapprove of even the faintest criticism of the religious."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"It's an incredible combination of politics, history, opression, travel, poetry, religion taken to an excess and, of course, ( given the Oprah recommendation) a mother and daughters' triumph over it all. I do not usually go for the Oprah books but I read each chapter more than one, just to relish every word. I was concerned that it would end in the typical &quot; I have reached my quota of words and now let's solve all of life's mysteries in 2 pages&quot;. Instead it was good to the last drop."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"If you wish to escape for a few days -- mentally -- climb into the minds of five different women and visit the jungles of the Congo. This book will consume you. Fire, flood, pestilence... and throughout the scenarios the five voices keep speaking loud and clear. Each distinctive.The daughter Ada thinks in anagrams. Disconcerting at first, until you realize Ada's (and Kingsolver's) brilliance. A five year old, Ruth May sees the new world and new friends with a child's eyes. Rachel's voice is almost Shakespearean in its comic relief -- her most prized possession is a mirror. Orleanna the mother -- with pain, we watch as she realizes her family is starving, but husband cannot come down from the pulpit long enough to help gather firewood. And Leah is calm, rational, the family's rock -- but still just a child too. And the unspoken voices -- the Congolese neighbors, market traders, bush pilots, school teachers, and the unknown force of political unrest boiling like the heat in summer.Parts of it reminded me of Jewel in the Crown -- but I found Poisonwood Bible more personable -- more readable. Several people have mentioned the last part of the book is not as colorful as the first 4/5ths -- I was glad for the relief. A good non-fiction book with a similar &quot;cultures collide&quot; theme is The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down by Anne Fadiman.I have enjoyed Barbara Kingsolver's other books, and this is the best yet. I doubly recommend it if you are a wordsmith and admirer of fine prose."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver has written a dynamic text that asks much of the reader as she guides you on a journey that is both physical and metaphysical. The reading has many layers from mere plot to intense comments on religion, politics, power, masculine vs. feminine energy, geography, history. This reading is in part a slice of liberal education at large. A caution to the reader is the fact that the narration is shared through five visions, five life philosophies, and five life experiences. Kingsolver does a fabulous job reminding us that &quot;truth&quot; and &quot;experience&quot; are subjective as each of the narrator's views the same situation and translates that experience in very different ways. What I liked best about the book was that I questioned my own belief systems as I was either identifying with or disagreeing with the characters.Cheers to your interpretation!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book will take you on an adventure - emotionally, mentally, and physically! Barbara Kingsolver places you in the Congo, during another place and time, through her amazing use of words. Emotionally you become a part of the Price family; feeling the sacrifice, devotion, and anger that each member faces throughout different times in their lives. Kingsolver made each character the author of their own &quot;chapters&quot; which gave them dimension, and a strong emotional connection between the reader and the characters. This is a book with amazing insight about life in the &quot;real world&quot;. I gained a whole new outlook on the meaning of each moment in our individual lives. Finishing this book gave me a feeling of despair, not because of the content, but because it was over. I found this book very nourishing to the soul!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver has truly written a wonderful book, full of family, love, abuse, and history. There is something that nearly everyone could identify with, whether it be the nationalistic pride felt by Leah's husband, the American arrogance displayed by Rachel, or the stuggle to fit in such as Adah demonstrates.I would have to agree with another review that the last section of the book was slow and difficult to wade through. Right as we are immersed into the adult lives of the three girls, Kingsolver belittles them next to the large historic events that have and are occuring in Africa. And honestly, we are more interested in what is happening in the lives of the girls.It was wonderfully encapturing. I found myself loving and hating various characters in the book, so much so that I would have to force myself not to skip one section merely to read one written about the character I truly enjoyed.From the jungle in which they are dumped to the Africa which will never truly escape them, these girls are a masterpiece which Kingsolver has created."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"As a South African living in the United States, I identified with the American missionary family of the Poisonwood Bible but I also identified with the African people of the Congo with whom they learn to live. I admit that I relished somewhat the stunningly ill-prepared manner in which this traditional Southern family lands in the center of the Congo jungle, but soon found it impossible not to empathize with their situation. The book is narrated from the family's point of view, each member taking turns many times before the book finishes. I'm not usually a fan of this approach, since it so often prevents one from identifying strongly with any one character. However, each of the personalities in Poisonwood Bible is richly and convincingly presented, and one feels an immediate connection with each one. This is a phenomenal story of family trial, tragedy, and growth, set in a very real Africa far removed from the quaint, safari-infatuated misperception of those who have never felt real African soil between their toes. The characters are placed awkwardly in the throes of 1950s and 1960s revolution, disease, and bungled government; a situation that sadly seems to persist in the DRC today. Although this historical background is well portrayed, the book maintains a very personal tone - it is always about the characters themselves. The Congo slowly works its way into their blood, showing itself as beauty, anger, and indifference."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver, a biologist from Arizona, is worth reading any time. However, The Poisonwood Bible is her very best work in my opinion, utilizing her magnificent talents in a fascinating historical novel."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Next to THE BIBLE, it is the best written book I've ever read. I recently bought a 1/2 dozen more copies to give to my best friends and family. Barbara Kingsolvers ability to jump from one character to another reminds me a bit of Robin Williams nearly insane ability to do the same. You'll find yourself identifying with one of the characters perspective, from which the story is told. A story of a family of 3 daughters, and a missionary couple headed from Georgia to the Congo, this novel will lead you to laugh and cry.It took two years for my wife to get me to pick up this book. I listened to it on audio CD and then read it. Simply Superb and now I want to read some of the author's other books."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"having tried reading this book a couple years ago, i picked it up again this summer -- so glad i did. now that i'm done reading this novel, i want to learn more. i'm going to read \\"king leopold's ghost\\" and kingsolver's recent book about sustainable farming.yes, the narrative appears to have a mission to educate about how humans have messed up in the past and how this leads us to continue to mess up now, and appears hopeful that we might be inspired to make changes for the better. i have no problem with this. besides, to paraphrase the book: there's preaching, and then there's preaching.... ;)"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book is excellent for everyone. I highly recommend it. I laughed and cried after reading nearly page.

We receive an idea of the life of the Congo from those who live there and from the unknowing Americans. We receive an idea of religion from the Congoese and from those who wish to change the Congoeses' views. Not only do we get the chance to see these different lifestyles, but we also get to glimpse them from the views of four very different daughters. This writing style makes it always exciting and despising at the same time. It is an awesome experience to receive all the different views of the daughters and of the mother as the story progresses, but it also causes us to despise the thinking of one character over another. I found myself often picking my favorite of the girls in certain circumstances while disliking another. The story line was as good as the character development. Yet, the book slowed after the mother-daughter escape from the hold of a determined-to-Save husband and the uncivilized lifestyle of the village. This book is amazing in the way it makes you think and the imagery that it leaves in your mind. It makes you question your religion and what mistakes the United States government can make."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This novel is such a favorite of mine that I have actually read it more than once. Although I do have some gripes with it--namely that I'm not sure the author did enough research on the Baptist sect--it is to this day one of the most amazing books I have ever read. The way Ms. Kingsolver differentiates in the narratives of the five main characters takes my breath away--the mother, Orleanna, with her thoughts on motherhood; Rachel, the eldest, stays true to her wordly character; Adah the mute with her backwards rhymes could not have been easy for Ms. Kingsolver to narrate; Leah, the bold one, the religious one in the beginning, whose world falls apart, the author captures in such a way that I wonder if she had a similar experience; and when narrating Ruth May, Ms. Kingsolver actually wrote like I would expect a five year old to think.That said, the fact that the author obviously did plenty of research on the history of the Congo, and yet had so many questionable \\"facts\\" about Baptist ministers/missionaries, surprised me. I wonder if Ms. Kingsolver meant for Nathan Price to be such a strange mix of Pentacostal, Methodist, and Baptist, and hope that that was the case, and not that she just shirked her research on this issue.In the end, shoddy research or not, the main idea of this book is the growth and development of five women who were changed immeasurably by their time in the Congo, and the true humanity of the characters, along with Ms. Kinsolver's beatiful prose, make this a must-read!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Ants tearing at your skin. The heat of the malaria-induced fever. The pain of hunger in your stomach. These are not things a typical American family must endure, but for the Price family it is a fact of life. Through the eyes of five women the simple joys and never-ending conflict of a missionary's life in the Congo are revealed.When the Nathan Price decides to move his wife and four children to a remote Congolese tribe, the family packs all of their Americanized necessities: a shovel head, cake mix, seeds, and a mirror. However, when they arrive, their everyday objects become obsolete. There is no wood for the handle of the shovel, the cake mix becomes infested with vermin, and the ground is unwilling to nurse the seeds. A cynic, a believer, a follower, a diva, and an innocent all tell their views on life in Africa. As the times change, each remains true to her roots and morals, bringing different angles to their unique tale.Barbara Kingsolver brings compassion, perspective, and moral outlook to Poisonwood Bible. While reading this novel, it seemed tiresome and dull, but upon reflection it has become a favorite of mine. The lessons and questions it addresses eventually made me enjoy this novel. Poisonwood Bible inspires self and worldly evaluation; the lessons are constantly connecting to my life. This book will remain a classic, relating to all ages, races, and religions. I highly recommend it to an avid, dedicated, and stubborn reader."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book was long but worth the time. First it gave me great insight into the political history of the Congo. I think it could have been a 50-100 pages shorter. Nonetheless, the author does a great job of developing all the characters. The book got captivating for me when the tragic event that causes the family to unravel takes place. I could not put it down after that! Highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I read this book a couple years ago. From the beginning of the novel, the reader is immediately drawn in to the lives of the overzealous, overbearing father; the placating mother and their four daughters as they travel to the Belgian Congo during political unrest to perform missionary work. While the children's personalities tend to be a bit cookie-cutter, they are each endearing in their own way - as they recount the experience in alternating voices throughout the novel. Kingsolver does such a wonderful job of painting vivid images of the family and the natives' everyday lives and their interaction with one another. At times, I felt as if I was there - living in the village with them. I found myself sharing their happiness, fear, pain and frustration (with the father!) throughout their journey. The political perspective of the novel is woven so pertinently into the family's life, it's clear Kingsolver did her research or personally lived through the events. It is beautifully written and carries a powerful message of both hope and dispair."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Sooooo disappointing; I saw all these wonderful reviews from so many newspapers and I thought it would be wonderful. I love stories set in Africa, regardless of the era. After the first 100 pages, the book seemed like it would never end. I felt it was a book written for children, from the point of view of 4 children. Definitely not a book for someone who enjoys good literature!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I love Barbara Kingsolver's other books, but when I read this one I was really disappointed. The book had wonderful writing, but the ending was disappointing in that the father put his family through all that, and then it seemed that he never accomplished what he went to the Congo for in the first place. The family was forced to stay in the Congo by the father's choice, and it kind of leaves a feeling that the family went through alot of unhappiness for nothing."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"By telling the story of a missionary family in the Congo at the time of Mobuto's rise to power, Kingsolver makes a valiant effort to inform and interest the reader in an event that Americans have little understanding. But in her use of different narrator (The four daughter of the missionary and his wife)Kingsolver fails to convince the reader that her narrators are speaking in their own &quot;voices.&quot; From a far too precocious 5 year old,the tomboy and her crippled genius twin, whose knack for palindromes and clever word play only distracted from the narrative, to the eldest child who seems to get less intelligent as time goes on, each character becomes less believable as the book continues on (and on and on...)A great book may have been written about this time of upheaval, this is just a missed opportunity."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Right of I just wanted to say that I didn't finish this Book. I found it hard to get into and I was periodically skiping lines to try to get to something good that might be in the book. In my opinion, if you can't wait untill you're in the 300's before you get into a book, then you should not be reading this book. The reason I did not like this book is because it was continuously repetitive. Narrators changed throughout the whole book but the story kept on repeating itself."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I have chosen to write my book report on the novel Posionwood Bible by Barbara Kingsolver. The book is set in the Congo, just as the fight for freedom from Belguim peaks. A white missionary family has just arrived and is caught in the political battle. They face many times of trouble during their stay.At the head of the family is a strong, fervent Southern Baptist Man who is determined to spread God's word to every poverty stricken child. Nathan Price will let nothing stand in his way and certainly has no time to deal with his wife, Orlenna, and their four daughters. With his \\"It's the Lord's way!\\" and indifferent attitude towards his family, many of the local villagers dislike him.Following in his wake is Orlenna and the daughters, Ruth May, Leah, Adah, and Rachel. The eldest is Rachel whose beauty and pale, fine hair amazes the locals, is very vain and lazy. The twins Leah and Adah are complete opposites. Leah wants to be just like her father and tries to please him. But Adah is less than perfect with her crippled left side. She looks at the world with a whole different viewpoint. Adah rarely speaks, and reads & writes backwards. The youngest, Ruth May, has a completely child like view of the world. Her entertaining descriptions of the Congo keep you laughing throughout the book.Another thing that gives the book an extra twist is the fact that every other chapter is told by a different person. Mainly by the daughters, but Orlenna gives you kind of flashbacks at the beginning of the chapters.So if you like political power struggles, crazy Catholic birds, and the tribes of Ham you should definitely read this book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I really enjoyed the first part of this book. Many of the other reviewers have already rehashed the story, so I am not going to tell it over again. But basically, the story reached a climax and ended when Ruth May died and the mom decided she'd had enough. She packs up, and takes her remaining daughters on a treacherous journey out of Africa, leaving the preacher dad far behind.This is where Kingsolver should have ended the story. At the very most, maybe added in one short chapter for each of the players, say, ten years into the future, just so we know what happened to them. Another 25 pages at the absolute most. But no, Kingsolver decided to use the next 200 pages to go through the next 30 years, and fill our heads with political blathering. History is supposed to be a backdrop in historical novels, not overtake them. But that is what Kingsolver did. The characters become lost in her political ramblings. It reached the point where I was just skimming to find out what was happening to the characters.The history of the Congo is tragic, that I know. I have read a great deal about the history of Africa, and traveled in Africa, so I am not writing this from the point of an ignoramous. The US and Belgium were much to blame for the course that history took for the worse. But I wanted to read a novel, not a history text. There are plenty of good ones to pick from. What Kingsolver did was divert from her story, and set up her own private soapbox, hoping that she had a captive audience.If the book had ended with the flight of Orleanna and her girls, then I would have given this book 5 stars. Unfortunately, authors like Kingsolver often don't know what to stop while the going is good."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Arguably, this is her most &quot;worked&quot; book, but she came short in her effort. The transplation to the middle of Africa, the way the daughters talk, the way the novel resolves, all created a sort of false atmoshpere.It was intelligent to use the girls as narrators, but this, paradoxically, and after the difficulties of establishing themselves, formed a non credible situation, and thus, the novel lost strength.Perhaps it's time to start an interesting discussion about marketing and literature, and what deserves to go to print, or, at least, invest big marketing dollars"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I think Barbara Kingsolver spoiled her otherwise well-written novel by allowing her political views to turn her novel into a political soapbox. I'm sure that Kingsolver had a reason for writing this novel, some point she wants to get across. I wonder what the point is. Her story of the Price family is, as Kingsolver says \\"a work of fiction.\\" The main characters are products of Kingsolver's imagination. One would wonder why Kingsolver portrays Nathan Price as such a total failure, but, since he is a fictional character, he is entirely what Kingsolver wants him to be: a failure. Kingsolver must have a reason to characterize Price as she did.Kingsolver claims that the historical setting of her novel, the Congo of the 1960's, is real. She cites historical events and has her characters draw conclusions from the events. She criticizes American involvement in the Congo, Belgium's colonization of the Congo, and Christianity's nonrelevance for the Congolese people. The Congo of the 1960's is the real world. I have checked other books to see how her \\"facts\\" compare with those who write history. I see that Kingsolver does not portray the real world honestly and fairly. She emphasized some facts and omitted others. In doing this, she has presented a distorted view that, coupled with her deliberate characterization of Nathan Price, makes me wonder even more: what is the point she wants to get across?Kingsolver states that Khrushchev wanted to take over the Belgian Congo and that Eisenhower ordered Lumumba's death and that Secretary Dulles wanted the Congolese government replaced at the earliest convenience. Kingsolver's readers would wonder why was the United States in the 1960's so involved in the Congo. Kingsolver has one of her characters opine that when Lumumba asked Khrushchev to come to the Congo's aid, Lumumba was bluffing. Kingsolver never mentions that in 1959, Khrushchev brought Castro's Cuba into the Soviet circle. We all should remember the Cuban missile crisis of the 1960's because Khrushchev's attempt to place nuclear weapons in Cuba almost took us to nuclear war. I don't applaud what the United States did in the Congo, but knowing about Cuba, I can realize the seriousness of Lumumba's bluff.Kingsolver said that the Congo was exploited for gold, diamonds, copper, ivory, and slaves. She didn't mention uranium. Other history books mention uranium. Uranium is of such strategic importance in the cold war that it far outweighs all the other resources combined. It' presence in the Congo doesn't excuse the West, but mention of it would make the West's panic more understandable. Kingsolver must have known about it. Why did she omit it?When civil unrest erupted in the Congo, Kingsolver states that \\"People are angry with the Europeans. They are even hurting women and little children.\\" She then condemns Belgium for sending troops back into the Congo. Other history books say that when the Congolese army revolted against the white officers commanding the army, gangs of Congolese soldiers raped the officers wives and daughters in front of the officers. Lumumba did not condone this, but he could not stop it. Belgium sent troops to protect its officers and their families from the violence. Kingsolver's deliberate understatement of the violence makes her readers think Belgium had other motives for sending troops.Kingsolver divided her book into seven sections, named \\"Genesis,\\" \\"Revelation,\\" \\"The Judges,\\" \\"Bel and the Serpents,\\" \\"Song of Three Children,\\" and \\"The Eyes in the Trees.\\" These references to Scripture and Nathan Price being a Christian missionary make one think Kingsolver is sympathetic to Scripture. However, she writes these grossly prejudicial statements: \\"Poor Congo, beautiful bride of men who took her jewels and promised her the kingdom.\\" Later she writes: \\"Priests held mass baptisms on the shore and marched their converts onto ships bound for sugar plantations in Brazil, slaves to the higher god of commodity agriculture.\\"She then has Leah say: \\"Jesus is poisonwood.\\" (Poisonwood is a tree that causes irritation to anyone coming in contact with it). I wonder why she titled her book \\"The Poisonwood Bible.\\" She makes her rejection of Scripture clear when she writes: \\"This is the story I believe in: when God was a child, the Rift Valley cradled a caldron of bare necessities, and out of it walked the first humans, upright on two legs . . . They made the Voodoo, the Earth's oldest religion . . .\\"None of this is supported by Scripture. God was never a child. Voodoo is not the Earth's oldest religion. The Earth's oldest religion is the relationship the first humans in the garden of Eden had with God. When you look deeper into Kingsolver's book, you see that the point she wants to make is also poison."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Ms. Kingsolver can certainly write a book. However, she uses this book as a forum to bash religion and men. She is so OFF-BASE about baptist religion. Baptists do not believe in infant baptism, nor do they believe you can &quot;stand in the rain and lay hands on children and baptize them&quot;, believers in Christ are baptised when they make a personal profession of faith in him. If Ms. Kingsolver is so OFF-BASE on the issue of baptism, one can only speculate she could be OFF-BASE on the political issues as well. I shall never read another Oprah Winfrey Book Club selection!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book goes on and on about a lot of things. The author uses too many descriptions to describe simple things. I didn't feel sympathy at all for any of the characters. I felt that reading that very thick book was a waste of my time. I love to read but I didn't get any satisfaction from reading this book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is an excellent chronicle of one family's evolution. My only complaint is that it peaks too early, with the novel's climax coming around page 350 -- with 200 pages left to wind down. I felt like each of the characters was very rich and well developed. My favorite was the mother, whose voice we rarely got to hear. But when she did narrate a chapter, it seemed she was answering all the questions the reader would be asking/demanding of her. I felt very emotionally attached to these characters, as the author did a formidable job of developing their fully believable, individual personas."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The first 300 pages of this novel, where we hear the voices of the four women as they try to live with their fanatical father, are a slow read indeed. It took me 3 months to get through the first half of the novel--this from someone who rarely spends more than 4-5 days reading a novel, no matter what it's length. It wasn't that it was so badly written, in fact, it's beautifully written (although the devices she uses to distingush between their voices become gimmicky after awhile). It's just that it's very difficult to read, I simply could not understand why they stayed. I don't think I'm spoiling the plot by giving away that they eventually leave--it's foreshadowed from the very first chapter. And for me, that was when the novel became interesting, to see how these women handled the shambles their lives had become. Although Leah is the one I admired most, I ended up liking Rachel in spite of her shallow political and racial views, simply because she was such a breath of fresh air after Leah's political fanaticism--which oddly echoed her father's religious obsession. And I found it fascinating that Adah had carried so much as the family scapegoat because of a deformity that existed only in the minds of the family. As another reviewer said, though, I would have liked to have Leah's thoughts (at the very end) about the gift she would give her father but if you stick it out this is the most rewarding book I've read that was published in the last 2-3 years."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I found this book hard going initially. The characterization of the children is a little thin, and I needed to constantly refer back to the beginning of the chapter to remind myself just whose point of view was being expounded. It also seemed to take forever for &quot;something to happen&quot; - and it could have done so half way instead of two thirds the way through. But eventually something certainly happens and from that moment on the excitement is gripping. When the daughters mature into adulthood, their different characters develop to the full, and we can all relate to one if not parts of all of them in the manner in which they handle the complexities of their lives. Thereafter the book becomes brilliant, intensly thought provoking and disturbing. I don't recommend many books - but this one I have recommended to many people. It is of particular interest to anyone who has experienced, in one form or another, an over zealous Christian upbringing."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I couldn't put this book down once I got past the first 50 pages. I found all the characters fascinating, including Rachel. Several reviewers have complained about Rachel's incorrect usage of words, but my best friend really talks like this - she says things like &quot;for all the cheese in China&quot; - and she is an otherwise well educated person! I wish Barbara Kingsolver had allowed the reader to hear Nathan's inner voice. The last half of the book drags and I think it presents an oversimplified version of African politics, but the book has sparked my interest in African history. My husband and I rarely read the same books, but we both enjoyed this one."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I was enamored with Kingsolver's writing style in this novel, I found it beautiful, witty and moving. I was somewhat disappointed in the ending. I did not feel that Rachel deserved to become the weak, self centered woman that Kingsolver made her. She became ridiculously stupid. I also felt that Kingsolver became preachy and too political with Leah's character, which was ironic because I think Kingsolver's intention was to condemn preachiness and intolerance. I was satisfied with Orleanna's character and Adah's character was beautiful and refreshing."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Having read Pigs in Heaven and The Bean Trees, I expected more of the same from Poisonwood. I couldn't have been more wrong -- or happier. TPB is one of the best books I've read in the last several years.The book deals with the effects of the Congo and the political turmoil of the early 60's on a family of very unprepared missionaries. It doesn't stoop to easy moralizing or condemnation, but instead focuses on the people involved and how they change. Each of the daughters has a distinct personality that reacts to and affects that of their parents. The villagers they attempt to convert are three-dimensional, neither the ignorant savages the father expects nor the romanticized pacifists that some stories feature.I was skeptical that a writer whose previous books (at least the ones I'd read) had focused on women in Arizona and Appalachia could believably recreate the tumultuous Zaire of the 1960's. I was completely wrong. Having read King Leopold's Ghost before it and Genocide in the Congo after, it definitely rings true in its portrayal of central Africa trying to emerge from a brutal colonial period. When I later watched \\"Lumumba\\", it seemed as if the world she had described came alive...Read it, laugh, learn and cry! It will all be over far too soon..."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is certainly the most powerful book written by Barbara Kingsolver. It is an epic novel, a tale of sin and redemption, set against a dramatic political turnover. The backstage is Congo's fight for independence from Belgium, the murder of Patrice Lumumba, the CIA coup to install his replacement, and the world economic game that plunges this African country into chaos.On the front stage we have a typical 19th century novel, with a familiar plot (see &quot;The Mosquito Coast,&quot; &quot;A Play in the Fields of the Lord,&quot; or &quot;Kalimantaan&quot;): the theme of white men trying to force his alien culture and religion on native societies, and the disintegration of previous values held by the intruders. The player in this act is a Baptist family, headed by Nathan Price an arrogant, eccentric, religious zealot, obsessed by faith and guilt, who is destined to risk his own life and the lives of those closest to him in pursuit of &quot;saving souls.&quot; He represents the patronizing attitude of white colonialists and their devastating legacy. His wife Orleanna is a symbol of passivity, totally dedicated to the care and survival of her kin. The Price family is complemented by four daughters: the oldest, selfish pragmatist 15-years old Rachel, the shrewd twins Leah and Adah, and the youngest, 5-years old, innocent Ruth May.The story begins with the arrival of the Price family in a small village called Kilanga, in 1959. The four girls narrate the story in turn, at the precipice of events, while the mother narrates in retrospect. The narrative turns on different axes, shaped by the 5 feminine characters, the way they contemplate themselves and one another, the surrounding events and their individual adaptation.Congo permeates &quot;The Poisonwood Bible,&quot; with descriptive, colorful, imaginative writing the author transports the reader into a world of tropical beauty, of heat and humidity, of abundance and drought. The author herself lived two years in Congo when she was a young girl and her childhood experiences had a lasting effect on her imagination. Although the author places her emphasis on people and not on politics, this a political angry novel, a critical view of imperialistic arrogance, exploitation, and prejudice. Kingsolver, a radicalist by nature, writes with strong idealistic messages, she deliberately hooks people into a good story and then gives a political lesson.Why the title &quot;The Poisonwood Bible?&quot; Nathan Price, the obsessed missionary shouts &quot;Tata Jesus is bangala!&quot; but it never occurs to him that in Kigongo (the language spoken in Kilanga) meaning depends on intonation, and while &quot;bangala&quot; may mean &quot;precious and dear,&quot; it can also mean poisonwood tree, a virulent local plant!."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I found this book to be very interesting in terms of family dynamics, &quot;religion&quot;, and culture. There was the simple (or not so simple) dynamic of a family of women. Because the story is told in the voices of the sisters and mother, the reader gets a glimpse of how the each female family member views, feels, and reacts to the scenes in the book. And Kingsolver does not simply retell the scene through different eyes (that would be boring). She was able to move the story along with each passage &quot;written&quot; in the language of one of the daughters or the mother.Interwoven throughout the story are the cultural perspectives of the Belgian Congo's inhabitants. This was most powerful for me in the passages about the fire ants and the passages about the garden.I thought it was a beautifully written book that will remain on my favorite current books list along with Memoirs of a Geisha and The Red Tent."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"&quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; by Barbara Kingsolver is one of the most powerful and well told stories I have ever read. This book is very deep and deals with many different voices and generations. The story of the Price family's work as missionaries in the Africian/Belgium Congo draws you in with amazing language, stories and the hardships that these people face. The book is divided into chapter narratives (by each of the four daughters and the mother) and the sense of adventure, heartache and even humor leaves the reader wanting more. I know the subject matter is extremely dramatic and sometimes violent, but it was the humor of these young daughters that I truly loved. I found myself laughing out loud at Rachel's comments and dreams for herself. Her dreams for going home, and what she's missing back home, cracked me up. Her shallow nature is refreshing in a way. You know you're getting the &quot;real&quot; her, and she's not holding any punches. All it would take to make her happy is a sweater twin-set. I truly loved Ruth Mae's innocence and ability to adapt and change with the surroundings she was forced to live in. The twins provided a voice of intelligence and often, power against their father's over-barring nature. His blinded foresight into the future was maddening and you wanted to just shake him with a force greater than any of these women had. I found the sisters relationship's to each other, and with the Congo beautiful to read. I really loved their individual stories. A beautiful story is told by all of them.I was deeply affected by this book and feel in love with these women. While I may not have always agreed with them or what they did, I can understand that they did the best with what they had. They did what they could to make it and be happy. I loved this book. My only complaint with it is, that it possibly went on a bit too long. I found myself wondering when it was going to end. I'm not sure that Barbara needed to go into such detail about what happens to the girls/women once they leave the Congo. A shorter and more condensed epilogue would have been a good idea.This is not a book for the faint of heart or inexperienced reader. It's a long and difficult read, but certainly worth the time and money. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is an intelligent and thought inspiring narrative on how well intentioned but misplaced missionary zeal can totally ignore the real needs of the culture it is trying to 'redeem' and at the same time those of its own family members. Innovative and original in the way Kingsolver unfolds her story through the eyes and mind of the various components of the family, eash with their individual outlook and age perspective, the book truly gives a new insight into africa - just as the characters will be indelibly marked by their experience, so too will the western reader be given a fresh look at Africa's troubled colonial past."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Having lived in South Africa for 21 years and in Georgia, USA for 29 years Barbara Kingsolver's book \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" hit a nerve. Barbara descriptions of life in Kilanga, Congo 40 years ago is astounding and brought back fond memories of my travels in villages in Mozambique, Zululand and the Transkei. The serene-looking faces, quick laughter and bare chested elegance of the village people fascinated me more than the tensed-faced, harried, self-conscious city folk I knew. Barbara's exquisite writing made me feel, see and sense Africa all over again. Each of the Price family members represented parts of me and helped me to understand myself better. Nathan's religious fanaticism, Orleanna's loyalty, Ruth Mae's innocence, Rachael's self-centeredness and the thoughtful keen-eyed observations of Adah and Leah, the twins. They were the true seekers of wisdom and truth. Barbara's comment about the USA and Western Europe's involvement in the bloodshed and devastation of Africa is shocking. The possible link between the CIA and Patrice Lumumba's death; the United States support of Joseph Mobutu's dictatorship and abuse of funds; Mobutu spending $20 million to bring two American boxers to Zaire so quote \\"all the world will respect the name Zaire\\" when his people were dying of starvation and disease; the Export-Import Bank loaning the Congo more than a billion dollars for a bogus power line so they can be assured a permanent debt and be repaid in cobalt and diamonds. I had not idea and feel outraged. Through the characters of the Fowles, Anatole, Leah, Adah and Orleanna, the author shows how the people who get off the treadmill of further, faster and more to return to nature and simplicity seem not only to survive but thrive."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I highly recommend &quot;The Poisonwood Bible.&quot; Since so many other Amazon reviewers provided background information on the plot of the book, I'll stick to my overall impressions.Kingsolver's rich, metaphorical language is a joy to behold. I copied dozens of passages from the &quot;Poisonwood&quot; into my journal because I want to remember and savor them. Not only will you feel the oppressing heat of the Congo, not only will you want to check your bedsheets for bugs, not only will you feel the awkwardness and pain the Price women endure as the only white family in a remote Congo village, but you will walk away from this book with a profound sense of gratitude for whatever simple amenities you may have in this life.Kingsolver manages to obtain the reader's complete empathy for the Price women. By the time I finished this book, I began to contemplate the universality of suffering. Suffering knows no cultural boundaries, and it is often the only thing binding us together as humans. Orleana Price, the mother, represents all mothers who must endure the pain of losing a child, whether to death or physical separation. The passages in which she describes her feelings about motherhood are some of the most beautiful prose I've ever read.I'd be remiss if I didn't mention two criticisms I have of this book. Kingsolver made a haphazard attempt to give a unique voice to each narrator(chapters are written from the perspectives of the mother and the four daughters). For example, Rachel has the most unique voice with her constant use of 1950s-1960s &quot;teenage&quot; vernacular, but I would find it odd when a sentence would start out with this jazzy vernacular and then suddenly shift to the lofty, intelligent voice of the author herself. So, in a sense, there are often two voices speaking. Perhaps this didn't bother other readers, but I found myself wincing at this more often that I would have liked.Secondly, Kingsolver tries too hard to get the point across that the U.S. and Belgium should have left the Congo alone. In other words, the reader gets hammered a lot with political theory. Leah and Adah, the twins, have many passages that address the political issues in the Congo, and I never really felt that these comments were the products of their own mind. Again, the voice of the author is fighting with the voices of the characters.This isn't a book you'll want to read in a hurry. Savor the beautiful metaphors and unforgettable descriptions of the people and landscape of the Congo. Take your time with this one!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kingsolver tackles a difficult issue in this novel. Whether she is successful is up to each individual reader and cannot be judged by one reading. The issue of going in and colonizing a nation, so to speak, or &quot;civilizing&quot; them through religion is not new. It's been debated for centuries and America has no farther to look than her own shores for such an ongoing argument.Kingsolver's characters are well developed, despite some exaggerated tendencies in Rachel and Adah, such as Rachel's insufferable self-centered nature and Adah's unstoppable cynicism. Yet the characters are believable and one cannot help but realize how easily the girls and perhaps even Nathan, are identified with. My strongest connection was with Adah, but I found myself agreeing with Leah, Orleanna, Ruth May and even Rachel sometimes.The political aspect of Kingsolver's mission is obvious. It's a blatant commentary on the actions taken in the Congo so long ago, and which we are feeling the effects of still. Yet why can't an author be direct? It does not diminish the characters, the setting, or the building of the tale. Perhaps we should, as Adah, suggested, read the story backwards, for it becomes a different story if you read it back to front."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I have found that an author who can both tell an amazing personal story and simultaneously educate her readers about historical events is very rare. Here, Kingsolver succeeds tremendously.In 1959, a Baptist minister named Nathan Price takes his wife and four blonde, blue-eyed daughters into the Belgian Congo to spread the glorious news--that Jesus Christ is bengala! Bengala is the word that can mean both &quot;precious and dear&quot; as well as &quot;poisonwood&quot; in the language of the townfolk of Kilanga, depending on where you place the accents in the word. Of course, when preaching, Nathan gets it wrong and thereby tells his reluctant congregants that Jesus Christ is the poisonwood tree--a tree that burns your skin and thereby brings misery to those who touch it.This metaphor is apt; the Price family is a disaster in the Congo. The story is alternately narrated by Nathan's wife, Orleanna, and his four daughters. The book touches on many themes--humans as just one form of life in the world; the inherent balance of nature; forgiveness and acceptance; and the evils that well-meaning foreigners can inflict on foreign lands.The most compelling part of this book to me, though, was the relationship of these five women to each other and to the Congo. Orleanna and each of her daughters illustrates a different perspective as to their almost unimaginable lives in the Congo. Rachel is portrayed as being obsessed with material things, longing for soda, dances, and being popular back in Bethlehem, Georgia. Leah is Adah's twin who seeks for and never acheives her father's approval, so she comes to rely on herself. Adah was harmed by Leah in the womb, so she cannot walk straight and does not like to talk and blames Leah for her disabilities, but she has a unique gift for palindromes and balance. Ruth May, the youngest, is remarkable as the only member of the family to elicit the love of the townspeople. Orleanna is nearly incapacitated with longing, regret, and guilt, and cannot leave the Congo even though she has not set foot in Africa for 25 years.The first 3/4 of this book is about the family's experience during the 14 months they live with Nathan. However, the book continues to follow the women for the next 30 years, against the backdrop of the original independence movement and the cleptocracy under Mobutu. I found this portion of the book to be somewhat less compelling than the intense story of the women's experiences with Nathan. However, it was still fascinating to see how that 14-month period shaped the women throughout the rest of their lives.Overall, a beautiful, overwhelming story--so different from the other Kingsolver books I have read. A strong story about women who each triumphs, in different ways, in the face of tragedy. Still more, it is a story about Americans (and all human beings)are only one part in a huge chain of life."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Unlike Kingsolver's other works, The Posionwood Bible takes a firm will at the beginning. It is a challenging read, starting off slow and building to a level of emotional and intellectual density that most novels never achieve. Her other novels require less commitment but as a reader you don't get the same satisfaction. When you put this one down, you'll want to join a book club; you'll ask everyone you know if they've read it and would they like to discuss it. If they have read it, they will want to talk about it. No novel in the past ten years has raised so many questions and conclusions in my mind. This is Kingsolver's finest work, telling not only the physical truth of a missionary's family life in Africa, but a deeper truth about the missionary spirit within us. On the basis of this book I anticipate only better and better novels from Ms. Kingsolver."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I grew up ten miles from Zaire, in a mining town in Zambia. I was there when this part of history was unfolding and heard all the dinner table talk. Kingsolver has done a brilliant job of capturing part of the complicated story of Africa, with all its beauty and its pain.The main lesson I learnt about anyone's reaction to Africa, and this book, is that it all depends on who they are and what is of interest to them. Barbara Kingsolver has used each of the characters to represent the typical views of Africa. There is the materialistic foreigner who is always above the locals, relates every experience to their American experience and wants to get what they can, rather than believing that they should also give something. There is the person interested in the ecology and medicinal value of plants. this is the colder, academic view of studying the physicality of Africa without getting emotionally involved. There is the person who wants to trully understand, respect and BE part of Africa and the people, and so on. Each of these characters use their particular lense to examine the same situations with very humerous results.It does make a farce of one missionary's efforts and even religious beliefs, but that was using just one character. In actual fact, this does reflect the many people in all professions who came to Africa and were just as optomistic, inflexible and downright blind - read Africa House about Gore-Brown which is truth, not fiction. Barbara Kingsolver's missionary was trying to do a noble deed, he just went about it the wrong way. A succesful missionary described in the book had embraced local ways more. Kingsolver was just showing this all too common pattern of behaviour in many outside people who came to Africa to 'show how to do it' - whatever that 'it' was. These people, great and small, rarely made much change in Africa and the old ways continue, rightly or wrongly.I read the book as I was leaving Africa to move to Canada and laughed out loud on the plane as I flew over the ocean. I found myself nodding my head and chuckling during the first half of the story, as the one culture (American, first world) moves to another culture (Africa, third world) and judges that culture through their own biases. It was then very amusing when that third world view goes to the First World and has their turn of criticizing the 'superior' country. They hate the lack of smell in the sterilized supermarket, the huge homes, the lack of community and caring, etc. I certainly hear similar comments from new third world immigrants here in Canada about how cold and selfish the First World folk are. I think Kingsolver has written about very real reactions on both sides - Third World and First World.These are all superficial 'takes' though. We all know (if you have been educated in the First World, you SHOULD know) that having the advantages of the city with its infrastructure and technology means losing other parts of a slower, simpler life. Books such as Simple Abundance are all about struggling to get back to that simpler way. I think Kingsolver was not judging but rather being a social anthropologist observing and holding up a mirror to the First World and five of the most typical reactions to Africa. She uses each character to parody each First World view in a fresh and very compelling way. She offers fast moving, blurry images. At the very least, they were entertaining and for me, offered much comfort as I left my beautiful homeland forever."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"One is alternately frustrated, angry, and amused at the antics of the remarkably rigid evangelical Baptist missionary Nathan Price. His story, the story of the Congo, and his family's stories are told in turn by his wife and daughters. In the end, Africa transforms not only the meager possessions that the Price family brought to the Congo, but each of the family members themselves.Nathan and his unforgiving, uncompromising, and uncomprehending brand of religion only survives as long as he does because of the quiet compassion of the villagers in Kilanga. In the end, he changes nothing of significance there and winds up being killed because of his religion induced blindness. His life story is a clear warning for those who in their smug self-righteousness do not allow for the fact that we could all be wrong in our belief systems.Orleanna Price, wife, mother, and survivor. It is she who holds the family together as best she can and shelters them from the tyrant father. She never does accept Africa as her own, but cannot escape its influence. Through tragedy, she grows to understand the mistaken attempts to save those poor souls in Africa, who in then end need no outside saviors.Rachel Price, is the oldest daughter and self-centered teenage product of the relatively affluent America. Her major concern is for her own looks and getting out of Africa to go back to her parties and easy life. She too is a survivor. But, as luck would have it, winds up staying in Africa and becoming a successful businesswoman. She never does understand her younger twin sisters who are both more observant and intellectually competent than Rachel will ever be.Leah Price is the &quot;normal&quot; twin, ever guilty for perhaps causing her sister to be crippled, and ever on the watch to please father. Yet it is she who grows independent enough to actually stand up to the tyrant. It is she who becomes the tomboy and feminist of the Price women. It is she who comes to love Africa and Anatole (her African husband and father of her children), and it is she who chooses to stay and help the people in any way she can.Adah Price is Leah's crippled twin and, like Leah, intelligent beyond her years. She suffers from hemiplegia, which seems to give her special insight into the way things are. She takes comfort in her own silence and uses her affliction to the best advantage. Adah is my favorite character because of her clear understanding of her father, their plight, the lives of the people of Kilanga, and where she fits in the world. Her understanding is not perfect, but it grows in time as she observes more in her own backward/forward way. Adah overcomes her hemiplegia and eventually becomes a successful biomedical researcher.Ruth May Price is the baby of the family. She is a wonderful, prescient child who is the first to make friends with the children of Kilanga. She is headstrong, persistent, and constantly pushing the limits. In the end, it is she who suffers not only from her own actions, but from the unforgiving Congo.Thus the Price family represents a cross-section of America in foreign affairs. Nathan is the self-righteousness of a rich and successful people who cannot see the virtues of a different culture and who recklessly impose unworkable solutions to perceived problems. Orleanna is the compliant &quot;my country right or wrong&quot; patriot of the masses who only rebels when it is perhaps too late. Rachel is the spoiled middle-class caring only about achieving and maintaining a comfortable life regardless of the world consequences. Adah represents the best intentions of our technology to bring relief to a suffering world, but still at arms length. Leah stands in for those who, out of guilt and recognition of wrong doing, actually try to bring about small steps on the path to progress that fit the culture of the wronged. And Ruth May is like all those innocent children who are harmed from neglect or misguided adults in pursuit of their selfish adult goals.And in the weaving of the Price family story, we learn a great deal about the Congo's fight for independence from Belgium. As each of the women tell their stories, in their own words, misspellings, and prejudices, the characters of the other family members and friends becomes a bit more complete, along with the story of the struggle of a people yearning to be free from foreign rule. The journey matters, and Barbara Kingsolver takes us on a compelling journey in The Poisonwood Bible. I enjoyed this book even more on my second reading."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"the Poisonwood Bible by Barbara Kingsolver is her most involved, most enjoyable read to date. The book's main characters, the Prices, a missionary family from Georgia sent to the Congo, are as believable as real people. They have human foibles, ignorance, passion, and thoughts. The story tracks their long days living in a small African village that tolerates their presences as well as it can. Everyone in the story is changed in an immense and measurable way. I found the setting fascinating and the writing lovely. Ms. Kingsolver can describe things so beautifully that it makes your heart ache. I thoroughly enjoyed her descriptions of African wildlife and botany and of the daily life struggles one has to endure just to keep oneself fed and disease-free. The chapters are written, alternately, by Mrs. Price and her four daughters. This brings a refreshing aspect to the novel that I just couldn't get enough of. I found this novel extremely compelling, however, I was disappointed in all the political talk near the end. I wanted more, more, more of the characters' stories and less of a history lesson at this point in the book. Plan on some late nights on this one-it's hard to put down!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Many critics have bemoaned the death of the great novel in recent years, but in the first two months of 2007 I have read two books to prove them wrong: \\"The Road,\\" by Cormac McCarthy and \\"The Poisonwood Bible,\\" Barbara Kingsolver's Pultizer Prize finalist from 1999 (if there were any such thing as justice in the world it would have won). These two novels prove that there is still a lot of life left in the fiction genre -- even in today's bottom-line driven publishing world that wants, above all else, to find the next Dan Brown or John Grisham. \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" is a true modern classic; a book that will be relevant decades from now, and one that is worthy of being taught in classrooms across the globe. You could write papers about its subject matter and the quality, and beauty, of its prose. Kingsolver chooses each word carefully in constructing her sentences, and she has a poet's precision in her craft. She also possesses an incredible gift for theme and narrative, but I'll get to that later.\\"I could never work out whether we were to view religion as a life-insurance policy or a life sentence.\\" (Pg. 96) In the beginning we are introduced to the Price family: Orleanna and the Reverend Nathan, and daughters Rachel, twins Leah and Adah, and Ruth May. In 1959, at the behest of Nathan they pack up and head to the African nation of the Congo to bring Jesus to the 'backward heathens' that reside there, and from the moment they pack their suitcases they are doomed. The girls and their mother don't want to go, but there is no stopping their determined father. Resigned to their fate, they think that they can bring their American home with them through Betty Crocker cake mixes and pretty green Easter dresses, and soon upon arrival in the tiny village of Kilanga they realize that they are completely unprepared for life in the wilds of Africa. They think that they are better than the African villagers surrounding them, but most of them get a harsh reality check about how all men are created equal in the ensuing months. The lone exception is the fanatical Nathan, who refuses to bow down to centuries of cultural mores in his foolhardy attempts to reform them to his American ideals and to his God. His refusal to give up, even when other missionaries evacuate after civil war breaks out, leads his family inexorably into disaster.It is no secret to say that one of the Price daughters is doomed, because it is made clear that this is the case from the novel's mesmerizing opening. The only question is which one will fall victim to her father's folly, and the suspense tears at your heart even before the shattering moment when the fated one is revealed, because Kingsolver manages the difficult task of making their disparate personalities equally lovable. It is the daughters who narrate the story, framed by haunting interludes from their mother at the beginning of each part where she reflects on her role in what happened to her family. Kingsolver does an amazing job getting inside of their heads and speaking in their unique voices, and each daughter has a different take on her surroundings that makes for intriguing reading. Malaprop-prone Rachel, the oldest, suffers through her sweet-sixteenth birthday in Kilanga, and wants nothing more than to return to the comforts of her American teen-princess life. Her desire to get out of there draws her into sexual tension with a dangerous local who has a plane that she would love to use to escape. Her not-so-casual racism is an affront, but through the course of the novel Kingsolver manages to make her a sympathetic, realistic character in her own right -- whether you end up loving her or hating her. Leah, the older of the twins, suffers from guilt because she unwittingly deprived her twin sister of nutrients in the womb and left her crippled. Leah tries to follow in the footsteps of her father to gain his approval, but this proves to be an impossible task. She is also the social conscience of her family -- the one who sees what injustices go on in Africa -- which leads to a dangerous friendship with a good-hearted local boy whose ideals are too volatile for the more traditional villagers and the government that has been corrupted by American influence. As guilty as Leah feels for her twin's physical handicap, Adah feels equally enraged at her sister and family. She has largely withdrawn from the limits of her body into her own inner world, where everything is slanted yet eerily accurate. She is misunderstood, branded a cynic and a lost cause, but the truth is that she strives toward a degree of realism and truth that most find uncomfortable. Yet, as smart as she is, her body is ill equipped to survive in a world where lions roam unseen, floods flash without warning, and numerous other dangers lurk in the shadows. Then there is Ruth May, a true firecracker and the youngest of the Price girls at a mere six years old. Fierce and determined as all youngest siblings tend to be, she refuses to be left out of any adventure -- and it is she who first makes headway in gaining the friendship of the villagers through the power of children at play. Her spirit is admirable, but it tends to lead her into situations that six year olds should probably avoid.The thematic elements of the novel are also stirring and beautifully realized. It's refreshing to read a book that isn't too dense to be accessible or too heavy-handed and open with its meaning. The crises in Africa and American involvement in them are rendered with a careful eye, and the characters are portrayed with an open mind and a palpable sense of respect -- even Nathan, whose backstory lends sympathy and creedence to his current life goals. The truth is that the Prices are all doomed by their tangle with Africa, not just the one who dies. Their dealings with the Congo leave a mark on them for the rest of their lives -- just like the boils and rashes that are left behind by the Poisonwood tree in the jungles. None of them will ever be able to go back to the life they once knew, and whether or not there is justice in this is left to the reader to determine.If \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" has a flaw it's that its denouement is a touch too long; the novel continues a full 150 pages after its climax, and spends too much time in that final section getting political and hammering in points that you already got -- and more subtlely -- earlier on. But the quality of the novel and the experience of reading it make that one misstep easily forgivable. \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" has easily launched itself into my top ten list -- and there just aren't enough praises that I could bestow upon it. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"A Missionary and his family in Africa.

I love historical novels. Barbara Kingsolver inserts the real story of what is going on in the Congo of the 60s so slickly with the story of missionaries that you hardly notice that she's done it. Written from the point of view of a mother and her 3 daughters, you get caught up in each one's view of their experience in Africa.

I have lived in the south for a number of years and I know how 'rednecked' some white preachers can get with their preaching. They are very unforgiving and don't hesitate to point a finger at you and call you a sinner! I have lived in Arkansas and been to churches in Alabama, Louisiana and Mississipi. Black people had it very very hard and they were scorned by the whites and beaten over the head with Bibles! (segregation)It is sad but it is true and I can fairly say that it is the author's right to bring out that kind of character of the fictional preacher in her book. Blacks have been through lots of pains growing up in the South and it just points out ignorance.I know that this is not how Christianity is suuposed to be but it is humans that are doing that, and Jesus would NEVER do that! It was hard for a black person to be a Christian in the South simply because of their skin color and there will be scars for years over that!The author is not putting down Christianity or demoting preachers but she is bringing out a character she probably has personally experienced."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Eventhough I enjoyed the chapters individually, I had a hard time following this narrative as told through the eyes of Nathan Price's wife and his four daughters.

With a fluid and often hilarious narrative Mathias lets us live as a child of the 1930's. His writing has that &quot;ring of truth&quot; which amplifies the humor and poignancy of the tales he tells. He never forgot how ten-year-olds view the world. A delightful, engrossing, touching memoir giving much needed context to the lives of those who gave the supreme sacrifice.Barbara Kingsolver has this to say about &quot;The GI Generation&quot;:&quot;What a joy it was to read this book by an author from my own hometown, who observes our little dot on the map with both humor and good grace. This memoir is an important reminder that urban life is not the only life: it reveals, for instance, that for people living close to their needs and far from the command-posts of the cash economy, a thing like the Great Depression could be largely irrelevant. Frank Mathias respectfully renders small-town history as a worthy piece of something larger: ourselves.

When I was at a loss as to what to read next, someone suggested this author.With the exception of maybe Prodigal Summer, to me Barbara Kingsolver at best is ho hum. Out of the 4 or 5 books of hers that I have now read, this was about the most BORING book I have ever read, period. It was painfully long, preachy, and had the same major flaw I saw with the other Kingsolver books I've read, severely lacking a point. I'm still at a loss as to what the deal was with the lunatic father in this book, but maybe more important, I don't care.I enjoy good story telling about strong people and families, despite any faults and issues they may have. Kingsolver has the ability to tell a story with good visuals, but her character building is consistently weak. I've finished most of her books not caring about any of her characters, wishing there was less PC and preaching, more character building, and wondering why I wasted my time. Bean Trees etc. were cute, \\"light and happy\\" stories: more for escape than anything real thought provoking, so I can excuse these flaws in those stories.I expected more from Poisonwood Bible.

As I said 130 odd pages and NOTHING happened, just a boring tale of boring day to day events, the characters featureless, the attitudes so predjudiced. First of all I thought the book was set in the early 1900's so out of date were the attitudes but no to my surprise it wasn't. There must be parts of America that are quite unenlightened. What a nerve to go into a foreign country and expect the people in it to go for all thay dribble, even witch doctors have more logic. Well Barbara Kingsolver I'd like my money back.

Never mind it seems she has a lot of relatives."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Unlike just about everyone else on the planet, I really didn't like this book at all. I'll start by saying that I absolutely love Kingsolver's other books, and was really psyched to sink my teeth into a juicy new (very fat) novel. Unfortunately, it was simply very disappointing.My most basic complaint is that, unlike the characters and situations in her other books, these seem more like cardboard cutouts places in a pre-scripted generic and banal relationship to each other. There's the suffering wife, the overbearing and 'evil' husband; there are the fourdaughters - the oldest being the belle, the middle twins feeling left out, and the baby seeming to not comprehend what was going on.To be fair, some of the characters are more developed than others - Ada, one of the twins, is disabled and the passages written from her point of view are clever and insightful; Ruth May, the baby, narrates some nicely innicent chapters. However, overall, I found the relationships between the characters to be cliche beyond belief - the love interests, for example. How predictable - and thus thoroughly uninteresting!Finally, Kingsolver really pushed the political agenda too far - it really interfered with the flow of the story. Very very disappointing, I must say!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This was the worst book I have ever read. By about the 35th page, I was simply lost in a confusion of boredom. Poor characterization, and lack of steady plot forced me to only be able to read about 50 pages at a time. If you want to retain your will to live, do not read this book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book came highly recommended but it's just plain awful. I kept reading hoping it would get better but it just got worse and worse. After finishing this book I made a decision that life was too short to spend any time sticking with books that are clearly rubbish on the off-chance that they'll improve toward the end.The characters are neither believable nor likeable and some parts of the plot are so harebrained that I actually found myself feeling embarrassed for the author."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver is brilliant, and this is her finest work. If you liked this book, check out her earlier novel &quot;Animal Dreams&quot;."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Don't hate me for dissing this book, but as a reader who LOVED Animal Dreams (by Kingsolver), I couldn't get into The Poisonwood Bible. The main thing that bothered me was that each chapter is narrated by one of four sisters. They have interesting personalities but I kept getting them confused. Their voices weren't unique enough for me to distinguish. That structure grew tiresome and I stopped reading the book after about 50 pages.I also found the topic of a Baptist family moving to Africa to convert people off-putting. Even though it is supposed to be set in the past, I don't want to relive that time period and be reminded of that kind of mentality.The Poisonwood Bible should not be the first novel you pick up by Kingsolver. A better sampling would be Animal Dreams. It is more accessible to the reader."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book is long on words, and moves very slow. It is not a very up beat book. I found half way through, I skipped around and never even finished it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Say? What about all the female characters that should have had to deal with not having any female necessities. The mother &amp; older daughter should have had to deal with not having any tampons or pads. What is up with that? Curious in Minnesota."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"What a waste of time. If you enjoy a simple-minded book bent on bashing Christianity, particularly Christian men and missionaries, this is the book for you. Nathan Price is the ultimate scarecrow -- a wildl inaccurate character created by a woman who probably does not know a single Christian husband. It is polemical and blatantly unfair. The background to the story, with the Congolese playing your typical band of &quot;noble savages&quot;, is equally offensive. This is political correctness at its worst.The white Christian man is a wife-beater who makes his family miserable and attempts to corrupt the noble African tribes. Heard this line before? It is the inverted Hollywood view of the world, and is itself curiously imperialistic. Those Americans who do not hop on board of an elitist rejection of Christian family values and a romanticized notion of non-western cultures will be characterized as villains in every possible context.In short, this is a simplistic read from a mean-spirited woman with a very narrow, and inaccurate, view of the world. Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The first half of the book was excellent. I really enjoyed the different voices of the young women involved. After they finally leave the jungle, however, the novel falls apart. Leah just becomes an apologist for the independence movement. Rachel becomes a characature -- never appears to mature. Ada makes a miraculous recovery. I would like to have had more thoughts by the mother after they left. I also was a bit confused by Ruth May as a snake since in literature this is usually such a negative symbol and she was innocence personified."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"When I was offered my store's advance copy of this book, I took it because it was written by Barbara Kingsolver, and I had enjoyed her other books. When I read on the back that this book is about Baptist missionaries in the Congo, I thought, &quot;Oh, well, I'll try it anyway.&quot; And, of course, given the author's magical way with language, I couldn't put it down! The wife and four daughters of the missionary take turns telling the story, and you come to know each character, and see all the other characters through her eyes. My favorite narrators are the oldest daughter, who commits a constant stream of malapropisms, and the youngest, who shares her baby view of the situations. I did not expect to be at all interested in the historical aspects of the book, but the history became fascinating as it wove through the personal stories. This will be one of the books that I strongly encourage (require?) my friends and family to read, partly to enrich their lives, and partly so that they can discuss it with me."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is an interesting novel, but I am concerned that naive readers may believe that the book provides a true picture of missionaries and their work. After all, not many people have had the opportunity to work for extended periods in isolated parts of Africa. I did so, for a number of years working on the transmission of tropical diseases, which often put me in contact with, and dependent on missionaries of various faiths. I can assure the reader that the characters in the novel have nothing in common with reality, nor is it necessary they should. But it is something to keep in mind."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"What a great read. I generally shy away from books this long (I get bored quickly, travel alot and don't like to carry big tomes, all the normal reasons.) This exception came highly recommended, and I found myself not wanting the book to end. The writing was clever - the same story was told through the eyes of several young girls and their mother, as they grew up facing the challenges of moving to, living in, and growing up in Africa. Well worth a read. It's not a beach book - but rather one of those that you'll enjoy on a cool fall day or into the winter."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is the first Barbara Kingsolver novel I read, based on some good reviews. I discovered a new voice, one that is unique to me, and I have read thousands of books--from Tolstoy to Tan. Kingsolver's writing is delicious. She is blessed with tremendous talent and insight. Other Amazon reviews will tell you the plot of this book, but I won't, because I was so enthralled by the absolute beauty and power of her writing that the story--as great as it was--was not my main focus while reading. Of course, I have since read The Bean Trees, Pigs In Heaven and Animal Dreams, and I have received the same treat each time I read one of her books...I get to revel in splendid writing."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Though the setting and the stories of a missionary family in Belgian Congo in the early 60s are fascinating, at some point, it starts to drag. Going back and forth between the mother and the daughters can be a little confusing especially since it seems that Kingsolver has used different &quot;voices&quot; for each of her characters. The evangelist, Nathan Price, the husband of Orleanna, father of Rachel, Leah, Adah and Ruth May, is a man of contradictions ~~ enough to be exasperated with him and typical of a lot of missionaries who only seek God's glory in the wrong ways. Orleanna seems to be a hen-pecked wife but she in turns discovers her strength when she needed it the most.The daughters are interesting in their own way. My least favorite is Rachel for she never loses her spoilness and selfish ways. My favorite is Leah ~~ she didn't let anything stop her in the way of true love. Not even war, prison, hunger, broken dreams ~~ none of it stopped her from staying with her husband.Kingsolver is consistent in one thing ~~ she is a writer who describes the surroundings in which her characters find themselves in. And you can feel the tropical heat of the jungle, see the insects, animals, hear the call of the monkeys and feel the humidity sticking to your skin. If you have time to read, then this is the book to read in slow spurts. Sometimes, it's all too much to handle in one sitting or even one week, but the ending does come. When I came to the end of the book, I felt a sense of relief that I was finally done. It isn't her best book ~~ Prodigal Summer more than makes up for what she didn't do in this book!!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Here is a family that is not prepared for what awaits them with they go to the Belgian Congo as missionaries. The cake mix that mom smuggles in has turned to a brick when she wants to prepare it for her daughter's birthday. I read this book about a year ago and I can still see the place where they lived in my mind's eye. The garden that failed. The villagers in the tattered clothing. Each character had her own distinct and interesting voice. My one criticism would be that the father was a bit of a mystery. Why was he so unbending? What was his suffering? Nevertheless, I would not hesitate to recommend this book or run to the library for her next book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The women in The Poisonwood Bible, the wife and four daughters of reverend Price despite their varied ages and personalities all come together beautifully to tell a moving and inspirational tale of their own personal growth. Orleanna and her daughters all grew to realize the faults of their husband/father and to learn however painful that they would be much better off without him. The Poisonwood Bible tracks the lifelines of each woman over a thirty year period starting in the Congo when Reverend Price first brought them there as a missionary hoping to baptize the young congolese. However the reader not only is allowed to see the damage done and the revelations made of these women in the Congo but also for thirty years afterward how this time spent in the African jungle is still effecting them. It is a book no woman should miss out on."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I can't say enough good things about this novel. It has become my all-time favorite book, and I read many, many books. The characters are engaging and fully developed, different and unique. The story is vast and microscopic. You laugh and cry in full empathy with the story tellers. Barbara Kingsolver has a truly wonderful voice and tells truly wonderful stories, this is her best. It is a novel that will stay with you forever, in your heart and mind. AND my husband loved it as much as I did."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book took me a long time to read, but it was so worth it. At first I was so mad at the father. How could he be so unfeeling towards his family to stay in Congo when everyone else is leaving? How could he ignore both his wife and daughters and claim to be an emassary of Christ? Then I got mad at the mother. What type of mother would let her children be abused? What type of mother would put up with a husband who would stay in the Congo indefinately? I really felt sorry for those little girls.Then the unthinkable happens, one of them dies and it forces actions upon the characters. The mother, loses herself and just walks right out of the country. This forces each of her children to take a different path. Each reacting to the circumstances.This book is narriated by each of the four girls and through this you learn each personality. The girls then go on to tell what happened throughout their lives (until the oldest is 50). It was interesting to see how each one reacted differently to their experiences in the Congo.I found this book so heavy that at times I could only read one chapter at a time. But it also compelled me to finish because I wanted to know how each girl ended up and what her motivation.Beyond that, the involvement of America in overthrowing governments just made me sick. How could we as a nation be involved in something like this? A really disturbing reality.Above all....Read this book"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"When I first started to read the Poisonwood Bible, it was hard for me to get into but after the first 100 pages the story really took off for me and I loved it. Barbara Kingslover creates very believable and strong characters and the descriptions makes you feel like you are truly in the Congolese Jungle.The Poisonwood Bible takes us into the Congolese jungle and we view it through the eyes of the four Price Girls, Rachel, Leah, Adah and Ruth May. Their father Nathan is a Baptist minister who is on a mission to convert the Congolese people into Christianity and he takes the girls along with their mother to Africa. Each and every member of this family, changes through this experience never to be the same again.This was the first book I read by Barbara Kingslover and I do plan on reading more by her."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I've read meny books in life of 65 years. I must say this is one of the very best. To write about everybody in the same book is to me a wonderful talent. I felt I knew these people personaly. My thanks to Barbara Kingsolver for a few hours of per joy and excitement. Fred Crowley"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book was a book I had so much about wasn't sure about reading it till my best friend read it and told me I just had to read it. Well I am glad I finally picked up this book.The Price family heads off to the Congo to go and do mission work for the church where there father works. Before going to the Congo the Price girls expect something different then what they are getting themselves into.Rachel the oldest of the Price girls doesn't want to be going to the congo she knows that it will be nothing like what she is expecting. As time goes on in the congo she starts to realize that she isn't happy there and would do anything to get out the place and away from her family. Rachel grows up a bit in the story but overall the I felt she stayed the same shallow way she was.Adah her and her twin sister Leah are feeling different about the congo. But no one would really know how Adah feels because she doesn't talk. When she and Leah were born Adah had problems in life. She walked with a lean to one side and rarely talked. As her time in the Congo goes on she starts to learn things that will change her for life. Overall in this book Adah was my favorite I loved how she grew up.Leah She is the one who has the brains of the family. She will voice her opinion on people and she also more of the beliver in her father then anyone. As time goes on Leah starts to fit into the Congo and there is where she starts to realize how happy she is there and how she has to look at her family and see the unhappiness in them. Leah grew up to be a strong person, but at times I felt like she was weak in ways.Ruth May the youngest of the Price girls and the one who seems to get into more trouble then anyone. As time goes on Ruth May starts to show the people of the Congo things that are in the US and starts to grow.Orleanna the mother of the girls and wife of Nathan as her time in the congo goes on she starts to realize that things aren't exactully what she expected them to be. She trys to make things better for the girls. But she too isn't happy there and would like to get out the Congo.. She was a strong woman, but towards the end her strength and happiness suffered.Overall this book covered 30 years of the familys life and there is alot that was told and alot that went on. This was a wonderful book that made me think about how each of the charactors would live and how they would go about there lives.This was my first book from this author and I hope to read more by her."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I felt this book was worth the read, but it was long, slow, and contrived. It was interesting, though, and I felt like a more informed person after I had finished."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"After reading several fairly interesting but lightweight books, I longed for something engaging. Did I ever get that in Barbara Kingsolver's The Poisonwood Bible. During work, it would call to me, and I would find myself slipping off to read &quot;just a little bit.&quot; At night, I would force my eyes open so that I could read &quot;just a little bit more.&quot; This one is totally absorbing. A fanatical Free-Will Baptist minister (too fanatical for his own religion, it turns out) takes his wife and four daughters to the Congo to save the natives. The story is told from the point of view of each of the female members of the family, primarily through the voices of the daughters. Each daughter has her own distinct voice and point of view so that the story unfolds and wraps around you like the native women readjust their pagne. Covering a time from 1959 to 1983, we see the disintegration and restructuring of a family while the Congo goes through a similar process. Although never beaten over the head with the details, we are being educated in a way of life not our own both in the family and in Africa. What more can you ask of a book but to be absorbingly well written and thought provoking too?"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"No question, this is Barbara Kingsolver's best effort to date, and that's saying a lot. A fantastic writer, capable of transporting the reader into her rich and carefully detailed worlds. I'd give this one 6 stars if I could."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I avoided this one for quite a while--too much hype for my taste. However, this is really well done &amp; sensitive. The view the reader has into each of the female protagonists is intoxicating. The social studies lessons are important, and not often examined here in the US. It inspired me to want much more information on the African continent, how it evolved and how it continues to do so."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"If you're like me, and you decide whether or not to read a book in the first 15 pages, go against your gut and stick with this one. It took me a good 80 pp to get into it, but I was well rewarded. The story is told from mulitple points of view - family members who travel with their patriarch to Africa to &quot;teach the heathens about Christ&quot;. Hilarity &amp; tragedy ensue. You will argue with your friends over which sister's monologues are the most interesting. Good reading!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"As one who reads little current day fiction among the many volumes I consume each year, I feel compelled to add my voice to those raised in praise of Kingsolver's Poisonwood Bible. What can you say about a book wnich was published over two years ago, has now 955 reviewers listed and continues to inspire reviewers at a prodigious rate. Kingsolver has blessed us with a masterpiece, one which every Christian missionary aspirant should read before embarking on a journey to convert the heathen. Rev. Price, much like Rev. Davidson in Sommerset Maugham's short story, Rain, goes where he and his religion are neither wanted nor needed and changes lives, including his, for the worse. Kingsolver illustrates graphically the ignorance and hubris inherent in those who go to lands where they know nothing about the peoples and traditions, to impart their superstitions to the natives. This is not to denigrate the truly good work done by those missionaries whose religion inspires them to do good works in fields in which they have special competence, but Kingsolver illustrates perfectly clearly the harm that can come from those proselytizers whose primary goal is to replace indiginous religious superstition with an imported variety."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"this book... ahhh... it has so much to give! it is in my top five for sure! insight into the mind of everyone in a way that is intimate beyond anyother book, because it never prefers one person over another. it has infinate applications, and just ohhhh... this book for sure!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Read this as my daughter has chosen it as her text for independent study this year. I did not expect it to be so very rich and deep in themes. I thoroughly liked the writing style - it flowed easily through really dense topics. I loved the structure of seeing the story unfold through the eyes of each female member of the family. I found this book hard to put down and could talk about it for hours. It is a great book for Book Clubs to discuss. After reading Spark Notes before starting this book, I thought I would find it dry and predictable, but I love it. Kingsolver is a very interesting woman in her own right and I would like to read another of her works. This is a great find."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"A book about a family who has to pay the price of their excentric preacher fathers choices to stay in the congo, in spite of the killing going on around them.

I also found myself very able to relate to the characters Leah and Ada. I found learning about all the characters very interesting and loved the mix of viewpoints.

I enjoyed it and gave it to several friends. Enjoy reading good books taking place in Africa. This book is different in the way Barbara Kingsolver had each person tell their own story. I didn't have the book any more and like to keep books I really enjoy so I bought it for my kindle and will read it again."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Each person in this book, and I say person because they all are well defined, is some aspect of a friend, acquaintance or family member you have experienced in life. I miss these people and mourn for an entire continent. The language and nuances are perfect and the emotions expressed from the characters and evoked from the reader are tender and real. This is an excellent book and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Writing is excellent.The story's voices and settings are so powerful.That so much of the facts are new to me is embarrassing."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"There May Be Spoilers AheadThe book is beautifully written. Barbara Kingsolver has a way with prose that can be truly breathtaking. Unfortunately, her characters are less so. I enjoyed the different sounding voices in the beginning and the wordplay involved in some of them. Adah was the only character that I could really get behind. Ruth was nice but her voice all but disappears near the middle which makes the shock of her death become much less emotionally stirring. Also the part where Orleanna can't figure out what's wrong with Ruth is stupid. You would think malaria would be the first thing thought of pills or no pills. Rachel and Leah are interesting at first but in the second half of the book (in which it's especially annoying with the way she talks. She's supposed to be a smart, savvy business woman yet she still talks like a sixteen-year old) almost seem to be created for the sole purpose of showing the difference between the &#34;good&#34; white people (Leah) and the &#34;bad&#34; white people (Rachel). Leah, who I'm assuming is who we're supposed to like the most since her sections are generally longer and there seem to be more of them especially towards the end, is extremely annoying. First with her disgusting hero-worship of her father, then, as the only &#34;enlightened&#34; child among them (which is ironic as she's the instigator of the final break with the village). She's supposed to be the only one trying to understand the African way of life and customs yet the whole village is thrown into turmoil because of her insistence to hunt with the men. Instead of showing that she's partly the cause it glides over that to say that she's the savior of her family because she put meat on the table. If she weren't so high-handed about the hunting thing a lot of things could have been avoided. In the latter half of the book her character is reduced even further. Then she becomes just about the only person who cares about Africa (including every other white person there and she's even presented as caring more about Africa than just about every African.) She just always sounds so damn smug that it's very annoying. Orleanna is little more than a door mat and instead of defying her husband to get her children safely home when it would do some good she has to wait until one of them actually dies before she does anything. To me that is unforgivably stupid. Nathan is a very one-dimensonal and even though it would have made the book a little longer it would have been nice to get his inner thoughts. We mostly get them through Orleanna but that seems a bit unsatisfying. Again it almost seems like Nathan and Anatole are supposed to be the opposite sides of the husband coing. Nathan is the extremely &#34;bad&#34; husband, Anatole the extremely &#34;good&#34; husband.The other thing that bothered me with the use of different voices was the fact that while Rachel can barely write the English language (a condition that's becoming all too familiar in reality) and Ruth May is only 5 or 6, at times they both lapse into beautiful and poetic prose (usually for the wrap-up of that person's segment). Which would be fine except that it sounds like Barbara Kingsolver just had to make her point and couldn't bear to do it in the plain words that would have suited the character better. I think she was too intent on making each wrap-up be poetic and meaningful that she sacrificed character to it. There were quite a few unrealistic points to it. Not anything requiring imagination, I have no problem with that. The unrealistic parts were more in how certain characters responded in certain situations. It seemed the were smarter or stupider than we'd come to expect in certain parts simply to make whatever point the author was trying to make. Like Leah's total 180 in regards to her father. As deep as her hero-worship for him is presented her turning away is quite sudden with not enough lead-up.As far as the history goes it made me want to read more factual books on it but usually when I read a novel, especially one that is heavily historical such as this one I always take it with a grain of salt anyway because history in a novel usually serves story instead of the other way around. I judge it by whether or not it makes me want to read more about it myself which this one did."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I had noticed this book before but cast it aside thinking it was another book about the good work missionaries do in the underdeveloped world. How wrong I was.The Poisonwood Bible contains a strong message about all the negatives that can happen with missionary activity.The book tells the story of Nathan Price and his family and what happened when they went to spread the word in the Congo. Things went wrong from the start when arrogant Pastor Nathan ( wrong person for the job and his church tried to tell him so ) arrived with a basket of seeds from plants native to North America. The Congolese apparently are so primitive they didn't know how to grow their own food. The plants failed in the Congo and Nathan began a difficult learning experience.The brilliance of the book comes from how it operates on so many levels. The story is told through the eyes of his wife and four daughters and each sees a different reality. It is set against a background of massive injustice inflicted on the Congo by the west ( Belgium and USA in the case). The culpability of President Eisenhower I found particularly disturbing. Unfortunately similar stories can be told of elsewhere with other western countries equally guilty. I would strongly recommend Mr Pip by Lloyd Jones about New Guinea. An amazing book I enjoyed it immensely and read it very quickly despite its not inconsiderable length."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible, by Barbara Kingsolver, is a novel of great change within the reader and within the book itself. Throughout this novel almost everyone and everything revolves around change. This concept of change is within life everyday, which makes it easy to imagine this as a true story. Barbara Kingsolver has a beautiful way of connecting real life, the revolution in the Congo, with the imaginary life of the Price family. Throughout the novel, several family members that were expected to change unfortunately did not. This was a slight let down, considering the other changes within the novel. I enjoyed the layout of the novel how you hear about the things that are going on through several different characters, just like Jody Picoult's novel My Sister's Keeper. Though the book did start of slow, it picked up in the end, like many books I have read, I personally don't enjoy slow starts but, it gave a texture to the book's reading style. The Poisonwood Bible was a compelling book and had obvious reasons to be my teacher's favorite book, highly recommended. I enjoyed every moment of reading this book, I recommend it strongly as well."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I read this book twice. Once many years ago when I had more free time. That time took me a year to read through. The second time was just recently when it was the subject of a book club. I didn't realize I had already read the book until I had read quite a few pages. I don't have free time now and knew I would never make it through. So I picked up the book on tape for my long daily commute. I was astonished at how beautifully this is written when I had the time to relax, enjoy, and think about the text. The different voices of the characters became clear and I realized how deeply the author's message is driven into the intricate story. I can't believe how much I enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbarba Kingsolver's \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" is a novel that evokes many emotions - sometimes sympathy, sometimes love, sometimes disgust, and sometimes curiosity. The author has given voice to the female characters in her novel, so the perspective in this novel is vastly feminine. However, that is not to say that the author neglects the male characters, as a matter of fact, it is the voices and thoughts of these female protagonists that give shape and form to the male characters of the book.The book is about a family - the Price family, consisting of a father, mother and four daughters. The eldest of the four daughters is fifteen, two of the daughters are twins, one of whom is at a physical disadvantage due to a deformity, and a little one aged five. Nathan Price, a former soldier who has experienced great psychological trauma during battle in WWII, and has now turned to God, uproots his family from their home and takes them deep into the Belgian Congo to preach the word of God as a missionary.In his zeal to convert the African people, he antagonizes and disrespects them. Instead of trying ti bridge differences, he tends to make the differences between the two cultures even more stark with his rigid ways. In his fervor to save their souls, he forgets that they are corporeal beings who also need respect - he preaches the word of God to them, but forgets about equality, treats them like inferiors and gives them little reason to emulate his ways. Whilst he denigrates and alienates the natives of the country in which he is now residing, at home his family struggles with the poor living conditions, lack of a social life, and the women of the family find themselves despising Nathan more and more. Tragedies soon befall the poor Price family, and those tragedies increase the rift between Nathan and his family. But at the same time, those same turn of events also makes the hardships of the people of Congo more relatable to this family, always treated like outsiders.Kingsolver clearly depicts how tragedy, sadness and loss can bring people together - even across cultures that clearly quite different. How being family is about understanding and acceptance, and sometimes that can come from outside of the family - and those people, then, become your spiritual family members. Kingsolver's social, psychological and political commentary are spot-on, and her voice as an author is clear, strong and worth praise. This was a touching book for me, and I hope it proves to be a rewarding read for you as well."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book is a classic example of why you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover. Initially starting out slow, the plot gets better and better with the initial character development out of the way. The plot draws the reader in deeper as we follow a slightly off-kilter pastor from Georgia into the hostile environment of one of Africas' wildest nations...where everything seems to go wrong. The author segregates the book into Bible-inspired chapters, each continuing the story from a totally different perspective.I was initially concerned that the book would be a little too 'God-preachy' for a normal everyday read, but Poisonwood isn't like that at all.In short, Barbara Kingsolver's The Poisonwood Bible is a must read. Fantastic plot twists, superb climax, and a conclusion that satisfies."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is an interesting perspective on evangelism and African culture. A Baptist minister takes his wife and 4 daughters to Africa. The conditions are worse then they imagined and the story is their struggle for survival. It is a wonderful book however it took me about 110 pages before I felt like I couldn't put it down. So if you decide to give it a try - be patient. What I really liked about Kingsolver's writing was not only her extensive reseach and description of African life but the way she gave distinctive voices to each character. Each character has a chapter to themselves. I believe she did a better job of this technique than Faulkner in As I Lay Dying."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book does a great job of looking at not only the struggles and aspects of the family culture, but also those of a global culture. Kingsolver does a great job of bringing into play the historical aspects of the Lumumba assassination. The novel also does am excellent job of depicting life in the Congo through it exquisite imagery and symbolism that Kinsolver displays. One aspect of the novel that I struggle with is the idea that Kingsolver seems to lack a comprehensive knowledge of the Gospel and this missing aspect is evident in her in writing. The novel though all in all is and excellent read and I recommend it for everyone."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I was assigned this book as a summer read and quickly became one of my favorite books. The novel leads the reader through a missionary family's struggles while they were in the Congo. The multi-perspective story telling gave the book a very real feel as if it were each person's account on their times and struggles in the Congo. It invoked deep pain and interest as the reader lives and dies with the characters. I would highly suggest this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The narrative scope of this novel is amazing. Between the conflict of the Price family against the revolution in the Congo, it is a work of art. The lush descriptions and points of view were refreshing."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I did not think it was slow - or difficult to read in any sense. And I am rather surprised that so many people ask why the girls didn't just leave. If any of you have lived similar lives - and did get up and leave - please share it with the rest of us."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I feel like I'm from another planet when I read comments saying that the first half of the Poisonwood Bible is hard to get through. The four voices are witty, insightful, at times engagingly clueless, and all in the midst of the full force gale of FAMILY. Add being semi-trapped in the Congo, a place I knew hardly anything about beforehand but rapidly came to know thanks to Kingsolver, and this is a definite can't-put-it-down book. By the time the ants invade, if you're not completely into this story, please check your pulse. If anything, I was a little let down once they leave their ramshackle place in the Congo. Then it's just another story about female angst. Not that there's anything wrong with that. Anyway, this is a lovely book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The idea of missionaries always puzzled me. Religious Westerners go marching into a foreign culture, tell the people they're praying to the wrong god, do some sort of good deed for the community (build a school, dig a well) then a bunch of locals convert? No resistance?Something seemed to be missing from ALL the missionary stories I'd ever heard. Kingsolver brings home that missing piece.Can't say how close it is to reality, but she does a good job illustrating the arrogance (and danger) of trying to export/sell your belief system to another culture, and how it doesn't always end in rainbows and puppy dogs. Kingsolver's gift for telling a story is legendary, and the book is a page-turner. Gritty, original. Total winner."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Hearing that this novel was about a missionary who drags his family to the Congo & then goes crazy, leaving them to suffer did not apeal to me, but a friend insisted upon lending it to me. The first few pages enthralled me with Kingsolver's beautiful prose. There is much humor in the different versions of events by the 3 daughters. The narrative structure, with each chapter narrated by one of the characters, reminds me of Faulkner's masterpiece, As I Lay Dying. Each daughter has a different reaction to the same experience & makes a different choice of how to live. One escapes to a life of comfort in South Africa. Another marries an African & works to help these oppressed people. I learned much about the Congo & how Belgium & our government exploited it. I learned a main reason why there are so many dictators & so much corruption in African countries & other countries: dictators & corrupt leaders are more useful to the U. S., other powerful nations, & multinational corporations because they can be bribed to serve foreign interests, instead of the interests of their people. I decided that I wanted my own copy of this work of art, so I bought one on amazon.com."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I love the Poisonwood Bible. It's easily on my list of favorite books. It's a heartwrenching story of the disintegration and survival of a family. Kingsolver rotates the pov through the four daughters and you learn to love them all, even the shallow Rachel. And that takes a great deal of skill to turn a character like Rachel into an interesting and lovable person. Even the chapters told from Ruth May, the baby of the family, manage to hold my attention. Great novel, one that everyone should read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is a really good book that is a basic bible for how not to do missions. I resisted reading this for years, but now I'm glad I did. I really got to know th characters deeply and disagree with other reviewers who feel that the characters were shallow. I enjoyed the short chapters which presented each set of circumstances from each of the five voices. A bit frustrating at the end when the author chose to simply report on different chunks of time from each of the 4 remaining women's lives. I felt the sting of death deeply during the reading of this book.I highly recommend this book and find myself intrigued with a wonderful part of the world whose native peoples have been subjected to horrifying circumstances and world politics."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"After reading such great reviews, I decided to give the Poisonwood Bible a chance. I wasn't disappointed, but I wasn't entirely thrilled reading this book. The author is great with descriptive words, although at times she did get a bit wordy; the story overall lacked excitement. I did not find the book compelling."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is one of the best novels I have read. Well-written, original and insightful. It is a book about relationships, broken families, and the cultural chasm that separates idealistic Westerners from the reality of the lives they seek to change. I read this book years ago, but there are lines and images that I have never forgotten. A masterpiece. Pity, she is not producing more."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book portrays the dangers and ultimate dissolution faced by a family when its patriarch relocates it to a third world African country on an idealistic (in this case religious) mission. I read the book because I was interested in what type of person would do this. Unfortunately, the father is sketched as a parody and his character is flat. Instead, the author devotes herself to amateurish left-wing political speculation and an often incorrect recounting of historical events in Africa. She implicitly preaches that all woman are part of a \\"good\\" sisterhood, facing evil men. I've seen comments on this website that this is more a book for women. In effect, this is saying that the novel is genre fiction, not literature - much as we might say that a war story or a western is \\"more for men.\\"For a better and earlier treatment of this theme, read Paul Theroux's \\"The Mosquito Coast,\\" first published in 1982. This book has a similar plot: a deluded and paranoid American father takes his family to Honduras to escape what he sees as the evils of modern America. The father is fully sketched as a believable character and the novel is well written in general."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"One of the best books I've read all year. This is well written, interesting, intelligent."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"How can so many commend this book? Though the writing itself is good, there is a real feeling of artifice - the characters are not believable at all. They are all one voice speaking in different dialects and sounding very contrived. Ideologically, everything about this book is a sham and a cliche.It reminded me of those &quot;mandatory reading&quot; books assigned in my communist school which were really propaganda - except those were a lot shorter and you knew what they were selling you from the start.Ms Kingsolver falls for every cliche in the book. However, the most revolting one (since it is such a flagrant LIE) is the implied notion that the problems of Africa and Africans are entirely the responsibility of white men. Funny how all those who espouse this view seem to flip over that chapter in the history book where we learn how the Arabs bought sold and dehumanized the African long before a white face showed up on the African shore. Yeah, white men exploited Africans - so did everyone else - including Africans themselves. Someone had to sell those slaves at the shore. And let's not even get into how African men treat women - but Ms Kingsolver doesn't really pick up on that since it wouldn't quite fit into her &quot;good African&quot; story.Whatis also forgotten is that the very concept of equality that the Africans seized on so eagerly is a construct of white people and the Western civilization. Africans themselves have enslaved each other for centuries - they heard about communism from the Russians and about Democracy from Westerners.And oh yeah, Christianity is all evil and bad - but those witch doctors and their chicken bones they are okay! The Christian missionary who wants to control the Africans - he's bad. But the scorcerer who controls the AFricans with fear and senseless superstition -he's good! At least the white man has some medicine that has real effect.I'd be returning my book, but all that paper seems useful in the bathroom."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is a character driven story as you may have read from other reviewers. Each character is very rich in description and motivation. However, there emotions are so extreme as if to prove pts about society. The good people in this book are sooo good and of course the bad are sooo villainous. I didn't care for most of the characters because to me they seemed very flat."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I wanted to like this book, I truly did. I have liked many of the books we've read for school, long and short. But this was simply awful. I couldn't even make myself like the characters, with the exception of the cussing bird, which was simply funny. The characters were flat and unchanging, and I completely agree with the post who mentioned all the mistakes Kingsolver made with Baptist rituals. I don't like to be preached at in any situation, but I especially hate it when it's in the guise of a real story. Whether or not I would've read any of Kingsolver's other books before I read this one, I cannot say. But I do know that I'll never read another one."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I didn't finish this book. I got 90% of the way through, got over it, and never finished it.The thing about this book is that it didn't make me want to read and read and never put it down. It was long, and tedious, and drawn out, and it didn't seem to have any structure. There were no highs and lows and expectations to keep you reading. It was just - boring.I was particularly drawn to any of the characters. I did feel like I was there in the Congo - but as soon as they left there, then it all went downhill for me.No structure."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"According to an interview I read, the intent of the author was to expose the US interference in the politics of Congo and Angola and thought that few people would read a non-fiction book about it. I emphasize with her. A lot of writers are preachers or prophets.The premise is good and important, but maybe a little one-sided. As a political moderate, I think that both sides have a story to tell. The story idea was very good, but the vague, poetic narration made the story less attainable. I wanted to see the beauty and suffering more clearly, not just through a veil. Nevertheless I read it all the way through and liked it okay. I understand that writers don't usually choose how a book comes out -- it has its own life and method."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I found it difficult to read a book about an orthodox Christian missionary family headed by an arrogant and neglecting father that traveled to a country unknown to them, with the notion that the native people were uncivilized, and that they were doing them a favor forcing their own beliefs upon them. However, I must admit that some of the plot was well conceived, and fairly interesting for it's part, especially the rising of the independent Congo, and how the Price family saw it. But for some reason I just could not bring myself to like it over all. The writing style was actually quite good in some parts, however much of the book struck me as unnecessary (especially the last 300 pages). However a lot of the book came off as sounding opinionated on the writer's author's part. Some of the characters were also quite boring. A good example would be Nathan, he felt quite underdeveloped. The question about whether the reader liked him or not was too black and white. There were few if any redeeming qualities about him, and he was not a complex character. He also felt unrealistic in that way. I doubt the existence of many people who are all that similar to him and I should hope there aren't any. That's the kind of perspective the book gives you of him. He's the bad guy. That's it, there's no underlying story with him no good qualities or even outstanding ones at that he was just bad. When reading this book I couldn't even help judging most of the characters as hopeless, on most of the characters. I mean they just seemed helpless. The only possible exception to that would be Leah, the one who seemed to have adapted the most and blended in with the Congo. And even then she was doomed to bear children and become helpless all over again. I say she's \\"doomed\\" to have children and that she becomes helpless again because Anatole is in jail half the time, and she can barley support her children and herself. I cannot say I would recommend this book to anyone, unless I strongly disliked them."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I was forced to read this novel for my English class, and I must say it's not something I'll be reading again.I give Barbara Kingsolver a well-deserved compliment for her ability to use amazing figurative language, and this novel contains a large amount. The concept behind the story is somewhat interesting, but after the first half of the book, the plot becomes rather pointless and boring.Kingsolver uses the last 250-300 pages to write a political satire which is not needed, since she had made her point throughout the first half. She also drags us through the next thirty or so years of the characters' lives, and it becomes extremely trivial.Most of the time the story is just way too drawn-out and can give you a headache.The book was not AS bad as I thought it would be (considering what I had heard about it), and Kingsolver can certainly write, so I will give her two stars.HOWEVER, I would NOT recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I loved the story of the Price family and how life in the Congo changed all of them. The rotating narrators of the story were a bit distracting, but it was interesting to see situations from multiple points of view. I started to really care about the characters by the middle of the novel, when the focus of the story suddenly shifted from the characters to a primer on Congo politics. By the time I got to the end of the book, I was just skimming the pages - try to pick out the eventual fate of the family from admist the political drudgery."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible by Barbara Kingsolver is a very good book that captivates its audience. It may begin a little slow, but after the first chapter, it begins to become more interesting. It keeps the reader on the edge of their seat, wondering what will happen to the Price family.The story is told by the four daughters (Rachel, Leah, Adah, and Ruth May) of Nathan Price who is a Baptist Preacher. His family travels to the Congo where they go to spread their religion. They take what they believe to be all of their necessities, but find that they really do not need them as much as they thought. The people living there are not used to such things and must live without them, as the Price family must also do.This story is about the Price family's struggles and hardships throughout their time living there. While they are there, the Congo begin to fight for their independence from Belgium.Throughout the story, we see how Orleanna Price feels and the hardships that she has faced. She is always seen second to her husband and she is tired of her feelings and opinions being disregarded. It also portrays the story of her four daughters. Rachel is the oldest and somewhat self-centered. The twins Adah and Leah are alike in many ways but differ in that Adah is crippled. Ruth May is the youngest. Their father is extremely strict in his religion, parenting, and views.Throughout the story,the Price family also learns to deal with their preconceived notions of racism. They go to the Congo thinking that the people there are different, but after awhile, they find that they are not really so different. They have different customs and such, but when a child dies, they weep at the injustice. As everyone else, they feel things the same.One reason why The Poisonwood Bible is so good is because it is telling one story through the eyes of five different people. Every chapter is told by a different person. This makes it more interesting. Barbara Kingsolver uses a different writing style and vocabulary for each different character, making it more realistic. This book captures the audience in the hardships of the Price family and how they overcome their problems. This is one of the reasons why it is so good."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I do not get what everyone has been raving about. I found the book longwinded and hard to follow. I did not relate to the characters and found them unsympathetic. I finished it because I felt I had to.....hoping that it would click eventually. It did not."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I buy a lot of books and this one was recommended by a little bookstore that I have truly grown to love. I wanted a book I couldn't put down and they have hit it right with every recommendation. Other reviewers who rate TPB highly have captured my sentiments exactly. I just want to add that the malapropisms, the &quot;politics on the sleeve,&quot; the way the story was told, and any other jab at this work only added to the depth, historical understanding and general enjoyment of this marvelous book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is indeed a remarkable piece of work by Ms. Kingsolver. The way she has built the story portraying different characters is simply great. I expect such great works to be repeated again."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Rarely have I seen such a gifted writer stymied by her own material. Kingsolver's technical skills rank with the best I've read in modern American fiction. That makes the long list of deficiences in plot and character in this book all the more disappointing. Suspending disbelief is impossible when one encounters 15-year-old American girls, even precocious ones, fretting over global politics in the Congo while fleeing a plague of flesh-eating ants. Or, a middle-aged Baptist preacher with a passion for God but who can not show even a conflicted, warped brand of affection for his wife and daughters. For that matter, what the heck was Nathan DOING while his family and his miniscule congregation starved to death and otherwise participated in the narrative? We are told he was &quot;away&quot; most of the time, but we can not fathom where he could have been, given the fact that it was a tiny village populated by people who'd come to despise him. As a sucker for great writing, I truly wanted to be swept up and carried into this book. But even a sucker can take only so much."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Written from the perspective of the characters in alternating chapters. It's a marvelous character study and narrative of the days gone by...I can see why this was on Optah's book list."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"B Kingsolver is a wonderful writer. She does her research. Her imagination is boundless. Sometimes she could use an edit."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book kept my interest. I couldn't wait to pick it up to continue reading. Each character in the book showed a different perspective on the teachings of the Bible."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Still reading the book and enjoying it very much. Interesting to see it from the point of view of each daughter as they watch their parents struggle with their life choices. Also makes you rethink what you may have thought about missionaries and their impact on those they are supposed to be serving. Good book, I would recommend it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book is one I've kind of sat and thought about for awhile. Which usually means good things about a book. And normally it does, but I bounced back and forth between liking this book and not caring for it at all. But I think it had more to do with the writing than the subject matter for the most part.When a brash commanding Reverend decides that he needs to be a Missionary, he forces his four children and wife to move out to the Congo with him where he starts preaching at the local people and expecting them to conform to his will. There they must struggle to live in a way they are unaccustomed. to until something tragic happens. And this tragedy will effect each of them in a different way and have them choose different courses for their lives.Obviously, the father Nathan, is not a sympathetic character in this book. The other characters can't stand him and he is portrayed as a tyrant. But Kingsolver is also careful to throw in the bit about him being injured in the army in there. It's well known that soldiers don't always come back the same person they left as in a war and it's quite a possibility that Nathan was changed in a way. So it leaves it to the reader to see whether or not he actually is a sympathetic character when weighing everything that has happened to him. The mother, Orleanna, I can't say I thought about much one way or the other. She was squashed down by Nathan and I dare say it left her with her own world in her head. Sure she took care of her kids, but there had to be some sort of escape for her and she does fade in and out in the book. The daughters were all distinct although you had to like some more than others. Rachel was too prissy and probably not a favorite of anyone. Adah was strange and hard to connect to, although she got better as the book progressed. Leah was probably the easiest character to become connected to, as she wanted to stand up for what she believed as right. And Ruth May is a young child filled with curiosity.There is a definitely stance on what Kingsolver believes in this book. Her view on politics and Africa is expressly stated through the actions of her characters. And she sheds a very sympathetic eye on the plight of Africa itself and a not so sympathetic tone with the foreign countries who mingle their affairs with it. And it would appear that she had to have had a bad experience with a reverend or missionary with the true terror she makes Nathan. Although there is a good missionary that appears in the book now and then. The writing itself is what I had trouble with. Kingsolver has a very poetic, descriptive way of writing and that's not the problem. The problem is that there is just way too much of it in this book. It could have easily been half this size and still told a good story. But after awhile I had to put the book down just to take a break because it seemed repetitive. And I enjoyed the latter half with the girls grown up than the previous half that detailed their first year in the Congo. It was just too slow paced for me.An interesting book and definitely one that you could tell the author did her research on. I don't know much about the politics of the Congo/Zaire itself, but I'd hazard to guess that Kingsolver probably did adequate research there as well. I think I still prefer her non-fiction though and would give this book a solid 3.5 stars.The Poisonwood BibleCopyright 1998543 pagesReview by M.

All she is doing is telling the facts. The Price's story cleary is a metaphor for what has become of the Congo, and how western values just do not work over there.

While reading it you feel as if you are actually in the Congo with the Price family. I can't say enough about this book, except that it is amazing. I did anthropology research in Kenya, and I can honestly relate to the character Leah in just about every way. The Poisonwood Bible made me miss Africa more than I ever imagined possible. There is a character in this story for everyone to relate to. It depicts the icredible and heartbreaking journey of a missionary family in the Belgian Congo in the 60's right before the Congoleese independence.

This book, her best to date, brings her to a new literary zenith. It is rich in metaphor and is told in a style incorporating magical realism. The writing is poetic, like a dream I've woken up from and wanted to hold on to like a misty smile, wanting to go back to sleep, continue the dream and go deeper into the mystery of myself and my connectedness to the word.This book tells the story of a family who goes to the Belgian Congo in the early 1960's. The father is a minister who hopes to bring Christianity to the African people. The experience is relived from the perspectives of each of the four daughters and mother, who share their narratives of pain, love, political turmoil and growth.The title is derived from the father's inability to understand the Congolese language and his misinterpretation of how they described the bible. This error by the father bespeaks his inability to connect with the people and his family.This is one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book was a little hard to get into at first, but it was definitely worth reading.

Not the kind of book most high school guys would enjoy. But I loved it. The story is certainly interesting, but I was more enamored with the writing style than anything else.

I don't think so. Moreover, I felt like the role of the Congo in this story was a gimmick--this story could just as well have been told in an American setting, which Kingsolver could have done more believably, because she apparently needs a bibliography to prove to her readers that she knows something about the Congo.

The thing that distinguishes Poisonwood Bible is that it is a work of deep, complex historical fiction and goes into some controversial areas. This is not a simple of tale of a missionary going into the Congo and &quot;subjugating or converting the Natives&quot; - maybe that was Nathan Price's original intent, but as is mentioned at one point, these &quot;natives&quot; like all human beings have had systems for conducting their lives for countless thousands of years before the missionaries came to teach them. I very much liked the way the book was written through the eyes of several different characters - 4 daughters and their mother - which was very interesting, as their personalities are quite different and well developed. I really liked how each of the characters evolved and took very different paths. There are some beautiful examples of the intermingling of different cultures and cultural conflict, and many surprises. I notice some people who reviewed the book feel that it doesn't do Christianity justice, but I think we all know, there are Christians and then there are Christians. Some with a good, pure, Jesus-like heart, and some with a self-righteous, egotistical agenda - this is no secret, and this distinction is well covered in the book. I also note that some people don't like how Barbara explores what they call her personal political views of what happened in the Congo - not sure I understand this, because as I read it, the things that happened were factual. Myself, I knew nothing about what happened in the Congo so found it both enlightening and disturbing - I guess we don't really like to hear about the arms of our country reaching into such dark places for such dark motives. Anyways, for me this book was a moving and very interesting read on many levels, that left me with much to think about, and it had a beautiful ending."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I absolutely loved this book! Whenever anyone asks me if there's a book I recommend, this is the first one that comes to mind. The story is told from the perspective of a mother and her four daughters. The various perceptions that each had about same event was fascinating! It is the kind of book that you get wrapped up in! I felt like I had really gone through something when I'd finished:D"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I'm almost done with this book, and unfortunately, I have to agree with the people who say it unravels a little at the end. I'm not saying I don't want to know about this period of African history, just that when the female characters decide they've finally had enough of Nathan and literally walk away, Kingsolver seems to abandon character development in favor of endless political commentary. Everything sort of shifts, from a story about a domineering preacher's relationship with an African village and his own family, to an essay about how the U.S. has wronged the Congo. Two characters suddenly become so one-dimensional it's annoying: Rachel becomes even more shallow and self-serving, while Leah becomes so self-righteous it's harder and harder to root for her as the novel goes on, even though intellectually I agree with what she's saying. My favorite characters are Adah, who remains complex and brooding but also mature and clever, and Orleanna, who doesn't get as much &quot;air time&quot; as her daughters in the second half of the book.Now, don't get me wrong, these are important issues and someone should write about them. I believe Americans often take for granted what they have and often have the attitude that &quot;third world&quot; countries wish they could be like us. But I think that Kingsolver is trying to write two books at once here. Maybe she would have been better off writing a novel about a preacher's family AND a book about this period of history.All that said, this is still an interesting and absorbing book and Kingsolver is one of my favorite authors. I would consider it worthwhile reading for just about anyone."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Rich and beautiful language combined with a fascinating and thought provoking story. Kingsolver knows her stuff, both in writing and in the history of the Congo/Zaire. The use of multiple narrators is extremely valuable. I have been waiting what seems years and years for a new Kingsolver novel, and this was more than worth the wait."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book was one that I read for summer reading. The book is divided into seven books: Genesis, The Revelation, The Judges, Bel and the Serpent, Exodus, Song of Three Children, and The Eyes in the Trees. Really, the entire book \\"Exodus\\" could have been omited from The Poisonwood Bible (it lasts from page 377 to 507). The novel is narrated by five females: Orleanna and her four children, Rachel, Leah, Adah, and Ruth May. They are all following Nathan Price, Orleanna's husband, into the African Congo for one year on a mission trip. There is far too much exposition in this book for my taste, lasting almost the first 100 pages. The climax comes oddly just past halfway in the book. After that, \\"Exodus\\" accounts for life after the climax, but like I said it could have been left out. It almost seems as if Kingsolver is just trying to make her novel long, like she wants to incorporate more actual history and doesn't know how. It is extremely dragged out and hard to get past the last 200 pages or so. The conclusion is bittersweet, and aside from the insanely long falling action, it's a good novel if you have some time on your hands."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Nathan Price, the father in the book, knows his Bible extremely well, being able to recite hundreds of verses from memory. There is this one scene where he is teaching Leah and he proclaims that the Lord helps those who help themselves. Hogwash... this is never mentioned in the Bible and to hear Nathan, the \\"knowledgeable\\" (at least legalistically) say it disheartened me because it showed the author's agenda. Christianity is pretty much given from only the author's perspective, subtlely different enough to think that the daughters and Orleanna think on their own, but not really. Or course, hardly anything good is said of Nathan Price, and it would've been interesting if 1 or 2 chapters were from his perspective.Another flaw, perhaps minute, is when one of the daughters goes to Emory, she studies agricultural engineering. I went to Emory and when I read that, I immediately knew that was impossible as Emory has no engineering program and a very weak math program.Nevertheless, the author is surely gifted and allowed me to go through the full range of emotions in reading this novel. She has a way with words, especially when speaking through Adah, which just stunned me at times with her wit... and then shifting over to Ruth May and reading it from a toddler's perspective was refreshing as well (although I wished there were more chapters from her point of view).Definitely an engaging read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I was very leary of picking this book up. I knew little of the author, and was afraid that the hoopla surrounding this book was just that - hoopla, and that this was just a simplistic treatment of complex issues such as - colonialism, proselytism, the politics of development, The Congo, Africa, etc.Boy, was I surprised! I was seized by this book and could not put it down without counting the minutes until I could swim in it again. This book is nothing short of brilliant! This is a work of historical fiction of the highest calibre. Ms. Kongsolver has done her historical, sociological, botanical, zoological, and political homework in ways authors of other historical-fictional works can only dream of.I won't go into what the book is about - you can read that from more professional reviews. I will say this however, to paraphrase &quot;The Nation&quot; - here is Africa's OWN voice: loud, clear, powerful, compassionate, angry, gentle, and brutally honest.Buy it or borrow it, and then read it!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book was quite moving and as others have stated, I am continually scrutinizing wasteful habits and inappropriate foreign policy after reading the book. I don't think Kingsolver's purpose in depicting Rachel, Nathan, and Leah was to advocate a certain way of life, but rather to offer the readers a look into how people cope with cultural and economic difference. At the same time though, I do think that Kingsolver is using the characters as foils for the reader's life. How do we compare with the characters? Well, while I'm not a Nathan Price, I'm not always the most culturally sensitive, I am too easily ignorant about damaging foreign policy, and I often minimize the struggle that others are going through in this world so that I can live more like Rachel. It is troubling and I can see why others have not enjoyed the book. At times, it not an enjoyable book at all. Rather, it points the finger to some degree and I appreciate that. Still, I do also wish that Leah or Kingsolver would have introduced liberation theology into the book. The books context was screaming for this, I thought, and it could have shown that there is an alternative to the rampaging of Nathan Price. Lastly, to those of you who thought Rachel was not realistic enough to be believable--I had a step-grandmother (who would be about Rachel\`s age) that was exactly as naive, ignorant, uncaring, ethnocentric and just plain dumb as she was. I was able to believe in her character totally!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I was initially intrigued by the premise of this book, having read over the years The Mosquito Coast and At Play in the Fields of the Lord, two books about earnest white people encountering cultures for which they were hopelessly unprepared. I got three-quarters of the way through The Poisonwood Bible and couldn't go on; it is overwritten in the way that much of Stephen King's work is, and this title could probably have been trimmed by a third. I haven't read any other work by Klingslover, but I hope her other books are better than this one.The premise is fascinating, the characters are nicely drawn, and the alternating narratives work up to a point, and then they start to become tedious. This book made me tired."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"For me, *The Poisonwood Bible* could have been on top of my personal list as an all-time classic. Alas! It does not.I thoroughly enjoyed the first half of this novel. In 1959, Nathan Price, a fire-and-brimstone Baptist envangelist/missionary, uprooted his Georgian family and takes them halfway around the world to the Belgian Congo. Including him, his wife (Orleanna) and his 4 daughters (Rachel, Leah, Adah and Ruth May) were totally unprepared for life in the Congo. I mean, they had packed boxes of Betty Crocker cake mixes.Though not one to give up, the Price women did their best to mingle and play with the natives. More often than not, they've had to \\"make do\\" while still holding on to some semblance of an American life on foreign land. Meanwhile, through frustration and bitterness, Nathan cannot understand why he cannot lead the native souls to salvation. The natives have explained why as well as their worldview. In simplicity, Nathan just had to modify to the natives' interests. However, remaining adamant to his style of belief and salvation, Nathan began to develop a personality that's similar to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. This transformation alienates him from the natives and even his family.All this change when a tragic event occurred. The Price women had enough and returned home in Georgia.At this point, it would have been great...along with a short story of what happens to everyone in the aftermath. But no, Kingsolver doesn't stop here. She continues the story well into the girls' adulthood, which they're the polar opposite than what they were as kids. And it just doesn't make sense, which made me scream out in frustration. Simply put, the second half killed my interest/liking of the novel."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is unlike any book I've ever read what is a very good book take place in South Africa totally be reversed from what happens in America sometime"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"An amazing story, Barbara Kingsolver is one of the greats. I loved each account as told by each character. Highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I first \\"read\\" this book years ago. Then I kept picking it up and reading parts of it again. (There are two copies in my house, because my daughter, not knowing I had it, got another.) Recently I read it through for the first time, though I did go back and forth looking up certain sections I recalled and favorite parts.Five women -- a mother and four daughters -- tell this story. Kingsolver has created five separate \\"voices\\" for these women (girls, in places) and the five people are all whole and believable. To be perfectly honest, there may be spots in which a particular person starts to sound too articulate -- places where Kingsolver needed to get some info in place. But mostly the five voices are fabulously real. One of them is riotously funny in her pretentious ignorance and use of malapropisms.But the book as a whole is not funny, any more than Life and its dance partner, Death, are funny in the long run. ***This is one of the best books I've ever read in my long life.*** I think the reason I failed to read it completely the first time was that it was too strong for me. Like the family of the book, I grew up with an autocratic father who spoiled things around him while being sure he was always right. . . .The people who are saying that you learn about the Congo are correct, too. I don't want to spoil the book for anyone by telling what is coming, any more than fate tells us what is coming in our lives.This book should come with a warning: CAUTION -- SOME PASSAGES FROM THIS BOOK MAY BURN PERMANENT SCARS ON YOUR HEART."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The 1,612 reviews before mine indicate the importance of \`The Poisonwood Bible', so this review is just a personal acknowledgment of Kingsolver's fine skills. The voices she gives the narrators during the epic tell the perspective, fears, strengths and weaknesses of the players better than in any novel I have read. She manages humour, renders disability, generates obsession, introduces fear and plumbs ignorance magnificently. Despite its imminent horror, I loved the dinner debate between the reverend and Anatole, and the chemistry between the confrontation (there's a few, but a special one) between Tata Ndu and the reverend transcends time and place. Rachel's views and vocabulary, narrated through another carefully crafted Kingsolver voice, bring increasingly perverse humour to the story.Kingsolver catalogues the relationships possible between humans and the environment with poetic flair and accuracy, and punctuates her descriptions with dramatic examples. Her care to trace the events of the novel with contemporary African and global politics is meticulous and highlights the hypocrisy of some big government thinking, past and still present. More importantly, she elevates the people of the Congo above the messianic stupidity of those who, in the name of myopic self service, have trampled them for centuries."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. This was required of a literature class I'm taking and it's incredible. I love how the author uses crazy southern slang in the novel, as the characters are from Georgia. Being from the South, I appreciated the dialect. This book is an easy read and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver is my favorite living writer. She crafts a story beautifully. The story's pacing and character development are written so well. It's difficult to not use hyperbole but it's not necessary really. I loved this novel. I read it years ago, and then most recently listened to it on unabridged CDs. the opening pages...the story itself rich with humor, history and terrible tragedy...and then its ending. All perfect. Thank you Barbara Kingsolver.I would also recommend Kingsolver's Lacuna. If it's possible, this novel is even better than The Poisonwood Bible."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"One of the best books I have read. I didn't want it to end. Set in the Belgian Congo, this novel deals with an American missionary familys experiences and struggles with everyday life in a war torn 3rd world country in the 1950's. It is written in the 'voice' of each of the four daughters and the wife. All have surprisingly different thoughts, feelings and emotions. It is a novel which, long after you have finished, keeps returning to your thoughts. Wonderful!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I find that the best way to make reviews helpful is by adding a list of books I love and books I hated. That way you can compare and determine whether you and I have similar tastes.

She brought alive in a very real way the nature of life and the international political intrigue of in the turbulent years of the Congolese independence, both from the perspective of a missionary family as well as locals. The story features viewpoints of happenings thru the eyes of a mother and 4 daughters in a gripping fashion!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This was a required book that I read when I was in high school. I typically hated reading, but this book was a pleasant surprise. The first probably 1/3 of the book was difficult to get through because of all of the history behind what was happening in the plot. It all unwound and became fascinating later on in the book though. I had never read about African history before so this book enlightened me so much because it contains so much truth while also telling an interesting fictional story. Kingsolver has beautifully written language in the book and it really puts detailed pictures in your mind. The characters are very well developed also. It is one of my all time favorite books."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I was very impressed with this book. Not only was it a wonderful story that allowed me to identify with the characters, but it left me questioning my own ideas and philosophies on life. The characters are very dynamic, and the different chapters are written form the varied perspectives of the 5 female members of the family. My favorite character was Adah, both gifted and disabled, who does not speak and sees the world from a &quot;backwards&quot; perspective.It seems like the kind of book that I will reread someday and enjoy and understand it more."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver delivers a compelling novel to be enjoyed throughout time with The Poisonwood Bible. Kingsolver is successful in adding both influences from her past as well as historical context into the novel, adding substance and giving a strong background to the book. While the novel seems to be simply a well-written work of fiction, there are many underlying meanings that all relate to Kingsolver's life, as well as the historical timing of the novel."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible, by Barbara Kingsolver, serves as a magnifying glass for readers to view the life of an American family and their self-destructive journey as Baptist missionaries in Kilanga, Africa during the 1960's. Kingsolver's superb character development allows the reader the clearly see the individual changes that occur in each Price family member as their family unit deteriorates amid the trials they face in the Congo. Kingsolver seamlessly transports the mind to a setting that is foreign to many. Her accurate descriptions of the culture, and environment, bridge the distance between what many envision Africa to be and how it truly is. The book is uniquely written from the perspectives of the four Price daughters, Rachel, Leah, Adah, and Ruth May, with Orleanna Price, their mother, interjecting a narrative every so often. The development of each character sheds light on the eurocentric culture that America is often prone to embrace, while at the same time highlighting Africa's simplistic nature. This work parallels Schwarz-Bart's &quot;The Bridge of Beyond&quot;, the story of a mother overcoming personal trials and tragedies in life, including the death of a child. While Kingsolver's mother character, Orleanna Price, is different in character and culture from Schwarz-Bart's Toussine, both prove to be mothers who are learning to constantly adapt to what life has given them and come out stronger in the end. The Poisonwood Bible depicts the reality that while people can overcome their past, they will always bear scars as a result. Although the Poisonwood Bible was written only a few years ago, it is one that can stand among the classics devoted to Africa's post-colonial period."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I read this a year or 2 ago but it stays in my mind as one of my favorites....intellectually stimulating, a real page turner, gripping politics."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible takes place in the Congo in the 1950's and 60's. It is about a family with a preacher for a father that is trying to christianize the natives. He is of no help to his family and they go thourgh hard times. When they are suggested to leave because a civil war was just won, but the father choses for them to stay. The rest of the book is about what happens to the family.If you make it through the first one hundrad pages it is a great book. The beginning of the book is a bit too slow but after that it has a lot more action. It has incredible detail that makes you feel like you are there in the jungle trying to survive. It is incredble to think about what a hard time the American would have to been in the Congo with no previous training in the languge or culture."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. It really caused me to think about how different life can and is in other parts of the world. It also reminded me that happiness does not lie in god, your possessions, or even where you live, but happiness comes from within. I was reminded that when we help others, we should truly be helping with what they need and not with what we want to give. I felt as though I myself have lived in Africa after having read this book. I learned what it was like to be truly poor and desperately hungry. It was one that I could not put down. I recommend it to everyone who loves to read, male or female. No one has been disappointed yet! I was enriched by reading this."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I can't even put into words how spectacularly amazing this book was.

It's &quot;I bought ALL the rest of Kingsolvers books and finished THOSE in a few days&quot; amazing. There were a few slow spots but none that I had trouble getting thru. I want more of this family - I want more of their live. I crave these people like I crave more Ya-Ya Sisterhood stories. (If you've read Ya-Ya Sisterhood and loved it like I did you'll know what I mean!!!)"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Full of intriguing, complex characters, and set in the wild, beating heart of Africa, The Poisonwood Bible makes it to my top 10 list of 'best reads ever'. Social commentary, spirituality, corruption, love and betrayal: Kingsolver tackles these subjects and more with panache. A must read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"By telling the story of a missionary family in the Congo at the time of Mobuto's rise to power, Kingsolver makes a valiant effort to inform and interest the reader in an event that Americans have little understanding. But in her use of different narrators (The four daughters of the missionary and his wife)Kingsolver fails to convince the reader that her narrators are speaking in their own &quot;voices.&quot; From a far too precocious 5 year old,the tomboy and her crippled genius twin, whose knack for palindromes and clever word play only distracted from the narrative, to the eldest child who seems to get less intelligent as time goes on, each character becomes less believable as the book continues on (and on and on...)A great book may have been written about this time of upheaval, this is just a missed opportunity."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is one of the better novels I have read as of late. The story begins when Nathan Price, a missionary, drags his wife and four daughters to the Belgian Congo in order to &quot;save&quot; the natives from eternal damnation by baptizing them in the river. The problem is, they do not want to be saved and even fear the river due to the crocodile situation. Meanwhile, the story is narrated by five different characters, the wife and each of her four daughters. The amazing thing about the book is that it works at all. You would think it would be tough to follow and confusing since it involves five different points of view, but Ms. Kingsolver pulls it off beautifully. The story flows almost effortlessly from one character to another without a break in the telling of the plot. She always seems to choose the right words to make the story work.I also must praise the research done on this novel in order to get the historical facts about the history of the Congo so right on the money. This is like a history lesson on the Congo except it is not revisionist history. It tells the truth and it is not always so flattering to the US. This novel took a lot of courage to write and publish, thanks to the First Amendment."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I struggled to get through this book. It certainly has some good points. The contrast in cultures is interesting, as is the drama of following a family as they venture to a new land. However, the book just perpetuates too many stereotypes. There's the narrowminded, arrogant white evangelical Christian man and his emotionally neglected wife. There's the four kids who, judging by the quality of their writing, are far smarter than any of the adults in the book. It's just too predictable...and horribly depressing."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This prize-winning book is exceptional in every way. It is a great read with some serious issues set in a mesmerizing plot."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Written from the view of four children in the Congo as a missionary family. This is the first book I have ever read that has the innocent and honesty of children. Life with a religious, narrow minded father, who does not even come close to being a good Christian when it comes to his family. He looks on his wife and four daughters as simple minded and not worthy of his time. I have not yet finished the entire book; but it will not put on the shelf until it is finished."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I've looked at many of the reviews and can't believe those giving it a 1-star. Those who rated it as such can't seem to try examining another person's point of view.The political content of the book was not overwhelming, as soom seem to suggest, but is hidden in their from time to time. I thought of it as an interesting experience, not as a trialing lesson. The metaphoric and poetic prose isn't something to wade through: it carries you along, like the river the people are afraid to bathe in because of the terrifying alligator.The main characters of this book are: Nathan Price, a strict, fierce, almost obsessive evangalical missionary who has gone to the Congo to teach the ways of God to the inhabitants of the Congo; Orleanna Price, Nathan's wife whose chapters come at big turning points in the book and are full of descriptions of Africa and poetry that, I admit, was hard to understand at first; Rachel, the eldest daughter who at 16 is forced to follow her parents to the jungle, and does not have the best attitude about it. First coming to the jungle, the children are always grasping at her blonde hair - this doesn't soften her opinion of the Congo in anyways. Leah and Adah are twins as different as moon and sun: Leah is a tomboy both in looks and actions who befriends the jungle, and Adah is her \\"crippled\\" twin who drags her leg as she walks, barely speaks, and expects pity wherever she goes. Ruth May, the youngest child, is a five-year-old who sees the world as a game and befriends the children of Kilanga, the village they are sent to.Life in the Congo isn't wonderful to the suburban-grown family. Nathan, our \\"Our Father\\" as the children timidly refer to him, constantly tries to make Africa bend to his will. His sermons hold little people; when he does receive some, he frightens them away with talk of baptizing. The Kilangese are terrified of the river, since a little girl was drowned in it by an alligator years before. He does not understand the different customs of the Congo: to him it is God, or nothing.Africa sends many different ordeals on the Price family, such as disease (Orleanna makes the girls stay inside for an hour, under the covers, every day to avoid it), hostilities from the chiefs, Tata Ndu, who thinks of the church as a way to get the \\"shamed\\" people off the streets and is concerned Nathan may be taking the good ancestor-worshippers, as well, and the witch doctor, Tata Muvunudu, who threatens horrible things if they do not go back to the old ways. In the end, it turns out Tata Muvunudu has planted mambas, snakes with the power to kill humans, in places where humans would run into them. One of these mambas ends up killing Ruth May in a terrifying and saddening incident. Other things upset the balance, too, in good ways and bad: Anatole, the learned man with scars all over his body as decoration, who later marries Leah, gets in a fight with Nathan about the church. The Congo gains independence, not a good thing as they cannot possibly run their own nation. Tata Lumumba, the savior of the Congo, is elected and then assisinated. An ant army runs into the camp and threatens to destroy everything and everyone.After Ruth May's death,the four Price women escape the Congo and head toward freedom. Each get it in their own way: Adah Price goes to a university and overcomes her crookedness; Leah marries Anatole and watches what becomes to her country; and Rachel owns a hotel and never gets rid of her snobby disposition. There are many aspects to this book, it has beautiful writing, and truly makes you think about life. 5 stars!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is that type of book that makes a writer want to give up writing since there's no way to do better than Kingsolver -- her style is fluid, engaging, flexible, smooth, and there are actually five styles, each from the mind of one of the girls or their mother.Her ability to tie-in minor details into the main theme, and strike home with them to engage the heart, is amazing. Muddah may I? It's a fun game the first time around, it's the nail in the book's theme at the end.It's not a book easy to put down; it's not a you want to end as abruptly as it does. But it ends as it should.What a wonderful view into Africa."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"From the mind that brought us The Bean Trees and High Tide in Tucson comes Barbara Kingsolver's epic novel The Poisonwood Bible. Many hours into the lives, customs, and cultures of the Congo and its denizens have culminated into this novel- a novel that is sure to endure the winds of time and that has already cemented itself into a classic, even though it has only been in print for about 8 years. The Poisonwood Bible, in its relatively small existence, has already garnered many prestigious awards and distinctions, including New York Times Bestseller and Editor's Choice, and an Oprah's Book Club Selection.Kingsolver's epic chronicles the unfortunate and odd events of a Southern Baptist family: Nathan Price, a fiery Baptist minister; Orleanna, his humble, hard-working, and occasionally hot-tempered wife; and their four daughters: Rachel, Leah, Adah, and Ruth May.Each of the six has their own faults and quirks, most made all the more obvious by their trials as a missionary family in a Congo that is ravaged by civil war and a conspiracy to assassinate the leader of a newly-christened republic. Nathan is notorious for assigning The Verse (a verse to be written out that pertains to the sin committed- and the previous ninety-nine verses [all from the Bible, including the Catholic Apocrypha]), and is hot-tempered and prone to lashing out at his daughters. Orleanna is known for her botched birthday cakes, her hard work, and her at-times violent temper. Rachel is surprisingly vain, especially concerning her precious blonde hair and has avery bad attitude when it comes to the living conditions in the Congo. Leah is trusting of everyone (sometimes to her disadvantage) and she professes love for, and marries, a young Congolese named Anatole. While alive, Ruth May had the ability to bring even the most complex subjects down to an understandable level; her childlike ways, however, were most likely a part of her eventual death by snakebite. Adah estranged herself from the world by not talking to anyone, in large part due to her debilitating condition; she chooses instead just to think to herself and conjecture about life, while at the same time creating palindromes (phrases that read the same backwards and forwards [i.e. ELAPSED OR ESTEEMED, ALL ADE MEETS ERODES PALE! , from the front of her notebook]) and reversing words to create a fresh new spin on old words and phrases; she also tends to get blamed for a lot of things, thus constantly getting The Verse.My personal favorite character, by infinitely far, is Adah. There are many reasons why her view appeals to me. I have often caught myself reversing words or attempting to give others the silent treatment because of something they did to me. I also was consistently amazed at her ability to create her amazing palindromes and her uncanny observations about life (\\"It is true that I do not speak as well as I think. But that is true for most people, as nearly as I can tell.\\" [p. 34]).More than anything, however, my appreciation for Adah's albeit quirky characteristics is more an appreciation of Kingsolver's writing prowess. In my opinion, if heaven had a book, it would be this one. Barbara Kingsolver's newest book is undoubteldy her finest. If anyone passes up this book without taking a look at it first, frankly, it's their HUGE loss."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"As I was reading this book, I felt myself take a red pen in hand and highlight all of the phrases that popped out at me or struck me. I found I was doing that a lot. It made me look at a lot of things that I had never really thought about, and it made me really appreciate what I have. This book helped to change my ignorant political views to more knowledgeable and well-informed ideas which I had been starting to acquire over a long period of time. I may be only 17, but this book seriously said something to me. I was so touched by it I wrote my National Peace Essay on the Democratic Republic of Congo as a failing democracy and quoted lines from the novel. I will always remember this line from the book for as long as I live (it doesn't really have to do with the essay but it's my favorite line): \\"This forest eats itself and lives forever.\\" Just think about that."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is my first Kingsolver novel. I picked it up knowing nothing about her other than she was considered a good writer, and nothing about the book other than a brief 2-sentence plot description. After just a few pages, I was struck with awe.Barbara Kingsolver is an amazing artist. Her prose is often poetic and full of wisdom and pith and truth. I'm not even going to give a synopsis. You can read that anywhere else on this page and quite frankly it is unimportant. It is the writing that shines here. Everything else takes a back seat.This definitely won't be my last Kingsolver novel."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Never having read Barbara Kingsolver before I was unsure of what to expect from TPB. It was recommended by several people who called it \\"compelling, but not a fast read.\\" From the moment I opened the book I found myself in the village of Kilanga, living right there with the Price family. I rooted for Leah and the love she so desperately wanted, I tasted disgust as I read about Nathan and tried to sympathize with a mother who did the best she could, most of the time. Compelling only scratches the surface. This book has much to show the world. The characters, trials, and triumphs will remain with me for quite some time."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book is an intriguing look into the lives of the wife and four daughters of a fascist preacher intent on converting the Congolese people to his form of religion. As though reading a continuing journal, each of the five women tells their own story of the trials and tribulations they were forced to endure during their time in the Congo. Interwoven with historical facts, vivid descriptions of the people and places, this is a wonderful book. Barbara Kingsolver is a fantastic storyteller, and I recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"At the begining I found the book to be boring and hard to follow becuse I couldn't pay attention. After I got passed a few books then it started to actually get good. The beining is just a lot of background information, of corse is necessary but i don't like all that. So if you have the patients to wait to get into a book then i'm sure you'll enjoy it, other wise if you're like me and you like a book to jump right to the point then i would suggest reading something else."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"While I found the story and characters compelling I grew very tired of the preaching...from Leah. I agree that Kinsglover was giving the reader her very one sided perspective of the many woes of the Congo..interesting but not why I chose to read the book. The best of the book comes from the various stories from Adah I believe. And, I really wanted to hear from Mrs. Price again. I would have been interested to know how she felt about her departure, her children, her tragedy, and the splintering of her girls. It occured to me that the struggle Rachel and Leah live with and through in their own ways, is the struggle to understand."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Nathan Price, a Southern Baptist minister, carries his wife and four daughters to Africa to do missionary work for one year in 1959. They find that the \\"necessities\\" they packed to take to the Belgian Congo are useless. They undergo numerous hardships while stationed in the Congo. Political changes give them the opportunity to leave, but the Reverend will not allow it. Despite the food shortages, illnesses, and uneasiness within the village, the Reverend refuses to leave. After the death of one daughter, the family leaves the Reverend behind. The story spans thirty years. It shows how the family recovered after life in the Congo. Two daughters stay in Africa while the mother and final daughter return to Georgia. The wife and daughters tell the story. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was difficult to stop reading it. The fact that it is told by the different females makes it interesting. You can see the change in personality and intelligence in each chapter. You can see a definite difference between the narration of the 5-year-old and the narration of the wife or genius daughters. It is a remarkable book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"It was a wonderful book..just sit down and enjoy it.

Warning - if you are not interested in the politics of Africa, don't buy it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Members of my book club were impressed by this work, and most stated that it was the best book that they had read in the last 20 years. With that, I eagerly picked-it-up but after fifty pages could not wait to put-it-down."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kingsolver shows us the real meaning of the story about the Blind Men and the Elephant. Each of her characters can only interpret the events of their daily lives through what they themselves can see, hear, feel, taste, smell, and understand. What little we learn about Nathan Price's prior life explains, but does not forgive, his zealous evangelicalism. Kingsolver reminds us that we, too, have our own set of prior knowledge and experiences that form our perspective of the world. Though a little tough to begin, this book is worth the late nights and missed television programs. You might also find yourself doing a little online research for information on the Belgian Congo and Zaire. And you will find you will never take for granted indoor plumbing, insect repellant, plastic-wrapped meat and pasteurized milk ever again."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"A clever look at language and cultures. Compelling and truly believable with unforgettable characters. Kingsolver's imagery transports the reader to another world deep in the Congo where a family is forever changed by their experience.This book was our Book Group's first selection and was unanimously rated a 5 by all members. I was so pleased that Oprah selected this book as it is an unforgettable read!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book is a nice way to pass the time. The description or the Congo are good enough to make you believe you've been there. If there was a lesson to be learned from all of the preaching however, I'm afraid it was lost on me. For the life of me I can't imagine what ending I was expecting but it certaily wasn't the ending she came up with."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I am only an occasional reader of contemporary fiction (mainly stick to non-fiction), but I have read most of Kingsolver's books and I'm happy to say that this is most definitely my favorite. Her writing is beautiful and her ability to develop the characters is what really brings the book to life for me. It did seem perhaps a little preachy toward the end, but it did make me more aware of the recent history in Congo."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"It's a great book, really something, super &amp; fabulous!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver has created a masterpiece. The writing in The Poisonwood Bible is exquisite, sharing the vitality and lushness of Africa while exposing the narrators' 5 different personalities. Having just finished the book today, I am intrigued about Africa's history and European influence - and beleive me, I am no history buff. Through a facsinating plot, beautiful imagery, and a real message in her writing, Kingsolver has accomplishd something wonderful - a novel that not only is fun to read, but reveals a deeper truth about life in the process. Bravo."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I found it to be very well written and extremely captivating. A man chooses his Teachings of God to 3rd world over his own family.

I bought it while on vacation with my husband and 3 year old daughter and couldn't put it down. I read it front to back in 5 days!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Few novels have inspired me, enthralled me and captivated me like this one.

Barbara Kingsolver has done an outstanding job of bringing each character to life. By the time I had finished reading this book, it was as if I knew each character personally. Thanks Barbara for a great hit! I was sitting with pen in hand when Oprah announced this was her pick, but I had already recommended this book to my friends a few months ago. Cannot wait for your next novel!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Plot; The plot of the poisonwood bible is not only intriguing but passionate in the way that it describes the different view points in which the characters express. What is most important in this story is that it is written from primarily a woman's point of view. This gives the novel a completely new approach. The fact that it gives almost all the characters a chance to speak greatly ads to the book's importance.Style: The style in which the story switched characters in order to show the different view points is very interesting. It gives the story a new side that most readers would not normally see. It allowed everyone from the older mother to the littlest child to speak and have a voice. It was also important because it showed the viewpoints of that child as apposed to the old mother.Language: I thought it was interesting the language that was used in the story. The contradiction of the so called primitive natives and the dignified Americans. It was a great clash of culture which proved to be both positive and negative."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Plot: the plot was intriguing and fairly easy to follow. While the plot was not very complex it was captivating and probably the biggest asset to the book. It was primarily written from a woman's point of view, which gave the story a different personality than most. It took literature from one narrow angle and made it dynamic and diverse.Style: the style in this book was very unique. It was captivating how the author wrote from so many different perspectives. I found this style much more interesting to read than that of other books.Language: The language in this book was mostly similar to that of other books. When the character Adah wrote, though, her language was very distinct. She wrote phrases backward, put in poems relating to various things, and the reader could really explore her mind."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver's The Poisonwood Bible is a magnificent piece of literature in which the author tells the story of a preacher, his wife, and his four daughters as they struggle to survive on a religious mission in the Congo. The book is written from the points of view of all five of the Price females, yet Kingsolver's own style is unmistakably present in each of the voices. She writes with an honesty that makes all her characters believable. Her prose that is neither dully straightforward, nor overwhelmingly lyrical.Each character uses slightly different language. Adah finds joy in the intricacies of language. Her chapters are erudite and full of dark whimsy. Palindromes are her favorite form of expression. Kingsolver abandons her grasp of English in Rachel's chapters in a display of the character's ignorance. Leah speaks in simplistic, down-to-earth tones. Ruth May seems too advanced for her age in her language, though Kingsolver obviously makes an attempt to alter her writing to sound like a three-year-old. Overall, her language is pleasing to read.The characters in The Poisonwood Bible are in-depth, though stereotypical. Leah is patient and boring. Adah is dark and silent. Rachel is flighty and the typical preppy American girl. Ruth May is an innocent toddler. Nathan Price is a patriarchal religious father. The redeeming quality is that Kingsolver herself has faith in her characters. She paints a vivid portrait of each one that makes them believable despite that our rational selves tell us that the characters fall too neatly into categories to ever show up as people in real life.The plot itself is intricate and incorporates the tragic history of the Congo. The family's daily life is easily believable. Kingsolver's gift is that she can make us, her readers, see the connection and balance of the entire universe in the simple actions of every day."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Plot- The plot of this book was a family of a mother, a father, and four girls go into the Congo to convert the tribe's people to Christianity. The mother and four daughters tell the story. The father is a stuck in his ways Baptist minister that thinks everyone should be a Christian.Characters- Nathan is the evil father and husband. He forces his family to come with him into the Congo. Orleanna started out afraid of standing up to Nathan, but then grew determined and left w/ her kids. She also takes all of the blame for Ruth-May's death. Leah is supportive of her father and falls in love with Anatole, who is the village teacher. Rachael is a prissy blonde that was forced to go. Adah is paralyzed on her left side but is the most observant of all of the women. Ruth-May is the youngest sister. She is very adventurous. A Mamba snake killed her.Language- The language did not seem to pose as much of a barrier to the family. They were able to regard to Anatole if they were ever confused. The kids communicated and got along with most of the village kids, and Nathan tried to force his ways into the village people no matter what language they spoke.Style- The family changed their style a whole lot throughout the book. Things started to be more important that were not important before. The valuables that they brought along slowly became less important to them. They spent more time worrying about food, water and sickness."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is what I thought about some attributes from the novelPlot. The plot of the poisonwood bible is the story of a Preacher's family who decide to become missionaries in The Belgian Congo. As the story unfolds it becomes clear that the father is abusive and the situation the family is in is quite dangerous. After the death of the youngest daughter the family splits up and live individual lives in various places.Style. The Poisonwood Bible is told through the perspectives of the daughters as the story goes on; and by the mother after she leaves Africa. This style of having one event discussed by more than one character gave it a roundness but sometimes it got a bit wordy.Language. It was written through how each of the women would have thought. This style was very effective in The Poisonwood Bible. Especially wonderful was the palindromes and poetry that the character Adah used.Characters. The main characters of the book were the price family. The protagonists were the daughters of the price family and the mother. I felt it was a good choice to have all of the women be protagonists, it helps the reader to understand each of them. And for most of the characters it was interesting, because they were all quite unique, though I felt that one of them was a tad boring."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The plot of The Poisonwood Bible was very interesting and creative. It moved at a good pace, and I was not bored too often when reading it. The story was very entertaining and it made me think a lot. It was rich with events, important and subtle, but each one keeping my attention and interest. The author really created a storyline that captivated its readers.The Poisonwood Bible's language was easy to read but really detailed and intriguing. The author used such grand descriptions that made a vivid image in my mind. Each section of the different characters was written differently. And so the language was constantly changing. This made it a lot more interesting to read.The style of The Poisonwood Bible was very creative and nicely written. The fact that it was written in sections made it very easy to read and very interesting. It almost seemed like a mix of nonfiction and fiction in a way. Because I felt like I learned a lot about Africa and what was going on there in that period. But at the same time the story was not boring at all because of its nonfiction aspects.The characters in The Poisonwood Bible were extremely rich and interesting. They seemed very real because of the way that the author portrayed them. Each character was different from the other. And their emotions and experiences were expressed very clearly so that it painted a perfect picture of the characters. Every character had their own separate personality, making them very intriguing."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Overall, I loved The Poisonwood Bible. In my opinion, it was the most beautifully written book I have ever read. The plot kept me captivated throughout the entire book, even the first and last pages that many say were pointless. The plot was interesting, based on something that I have never really read about before. Reading the book made me think constantly of what it would be like to live in the book, be in that plot. It is such a fascinating topic, what would happen if a family of white Christians in the 60's came and tried to change a completely black village in Africa. Having a plot that automatically interesting kept me interested in it the whole time. The plot was a real backbone for the book, and the words never really strayed from the plot. I loved that the plot extended onto the lives of the Price family many many years after they came to the Congo, which really put an ending to the story, wrapped everything up, and didn't leave you hanging on what might have happened to the characters.The characters in The Poisonwood Bible are also really brilliantly written into the book. Each and every character is described in detail, and the reader can always really relate to them, or rather, can really understand what each character feels, thinks, and what they do and do not understand. For instance, Ruth May is described perfectly as a child; someone who is outgoing, smart, strong, but obviously oblivious to many of the things that are happening around her. Each different character is there own person, has their own individuality. Adding to that, the characters in this book are also wonderfully written in how each interacts with one another. For instance Rachael discarding everyone but herself, and each one's personal relationship with each different person.They style in which this book is written was perfect for me to read, as it is the same style in which I would like to write. For some, it could have been boring, because the book is not necessarily incredibly eventful, or action packed. But to me, the way that it was written in description was awesome. The style of this book was not happenings, not people always doing huge interesting things, but slower, stopping to tell about what was around each character, the smells and sights. This style was absolutely captivating for me.When I first read The Poisonwood Bible right before I went to Africa myself, my mother told me that even if the plot was completely uninteresting to me, just to close my eyes and picture the images that the author draws in words. That is also what I ended up doing. Finding the plot almost slow in the beginning the first time I read the book (though I didn't find it slow in any way the second time), I literally just stopped reading and saw everything that was described. This book was written so beautifully that the writing was all I really needed to love the book. I could almost live in the Congo with them, I could see while reading the book the atmosphere, feel it and smell it. There was nothing bare or plane about the writing either. It never really just stated anything, just described a place or sound boringly, there were always creative and beautiful, or even revolting words to illustrate everything.All in all, in conclusion I would by far say that this is one of the best books I have read so far, and would most definitely recommend it to anyone that would enjoy beautiful images and words. I was never bored in what was happening, and the plot was so different from anything else, that I never wanted once to put it down and not find out what would happen in the end."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible set in the Belgian Congo during the 1960's, releases the story of a missionary family and their journey to Africa. The Poisonwood Bible is a historical based novel, where much happens politically in just a small amount of time. Within five hundred pages of mostly fiction plot isn't the main focus of the novel. The story is made of mostly thoughts and reflection, and some of this could have been replaced with more action and adventure for some extra balance to the overall tale.Kingsolver seems to make a huge effort to drive this book by its characters. The characters seem so real, because the reader can see inside the protagonist's heads. Kingsolver allows five women, four being only children for a majority of the book, to release such strong views, beliefs and emotions. Within the family of characters, each person was given such a different personality; this was key to get the broadest sense of the story possible.The language is consistent through out the entire novel. I wouldn't say it was an easy book to read, but I wasn't sitting next to a dictionary looking up three words per page. The content of the book is what was more difficult to undertake. Depending on what stage of life the reader is in could change the book entirely. Kingsolver makes it easy for the reader to relate to book by incorporating \`every human' thoughts into the characters thoughts.The beautiful and unique style of The Poisonwood Bible is what kept me turning the pages in a smooth rhythm for so long. The images and writing techniques used in Kingsolver writing of this book, is what made it seem so real. After finishing this book it was hard to believe it was a work of fiction. Detailed descriptions and portrayal of the big picture are two aspects of writing Kingsolver managed to use and put together to keep the equilibrium of the book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The plot of the Poisonwood Bible was a little slow moving because almost everything that happened had to be analyzed in turn by each of the perspectives. One would think that this might make the book boring, but it doesn't. Because each of the perspectives is so different, it is like hearing about an entirely different event. Overall, the way it was told added enough to the plot to help it stay interesting throughout the entire novel.The language changed constantly in the Poisonwood Bible, depending on who was speaking, and that made it easier to read because one wouldn't get tired of the way that it was being written. The language never got old because it was constantly switching, which made the story much more interesting. Even though the language changed, there were always beautifully constructed sentences and description so that the book flowed easily from one thing to the next.The style of the book was ingenious. There was very little third person narration except when Africa was speaking. In most novels like that, it is difficult to get the whole picture because the way a person sees things is often very different from the way they actually are. In this book, however, they managed to do almost all first person narration and still portray the full picture, by their use of switching perspectives from character to character.The character development in this novel was about as good as it could be for the five women of the price family, because it got inside each one of their heads. We got to know the thought process of each of the girls and a little bit of the mother's. The father however, was portrayed as a static character, and we never got to actually hear what he was thinking because the author left his view out of the novel. The characters were also very stereotypical: there was the ditz, the cripple, the religious fanatic, the strong one, the baby, and the submissive and oppressed mother."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is a book that entertains, educates, and envelops the reader in the story about a humble preachers family that takes a missionary opening in the Congo. The book takes place largely in the 70's, during the period where the Belgian Congo severed its ties with Belgium and started their own independent country. The Price Family, a family of six (Father-Nathan, Wife-Orleanna, and Children-Ruth may, Adah, Leah, and Rachel.) Is sent to the Congo to preach to the Congolese the teachings of Jesus Christ, but the political uprising, harsh living conditions, and general madness causes the family to quickly start a downward spiral into the disintegration of a family.The story is presented in an interesting format; all of the female family members take over the job of writing a chapter. So, for example, the first chapter may be told from the viewpoint of a very young child named Ruth May, but a much older child named Rachel would write the next chapter. This technique works as a very viable alternative to the tired and old Omnipotent overseer of events/narrorator. The writing style of the book is also another strong point about this book, not only is it beautiful, and able to envelop the reader with the sense that they are experiencing the situations themselves, but the writing style changes from character to character. Some characters have a very simplistic writing style, but others are complex and poetic. This really helps get across the idea that the reader is getting a different perspective on the situation from each character.The overall style of the book is different than most, just because of the different characters perspectives, and the historic background setting. It's almost like a history book with characters, because it creates emotional situations for the characters while also showing what was going on at the time, and how it affected the characters way of life. Also it's a very realistic style, so it feels like the book is actually a compilation of journals of a real family, living in the Congo at the time. This creates an even deeper sense of meaning for the book. If it were presented in a more normal format, the impact wouldn't have been nearly as strong. Barbara Kingsolver's novel really conveys the situation of a political movement in the heart of Africa, while carefully crafting a family drama, and presenting it in an unusual style, and executed with beautiful writing and precision."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"A masterpiece of literary craft and social conscience. A well-researched and biting critique of American imperialism in Africa in the 1950s and '60s, and a matching parable of religion at its worst (and best, thanks to Brother Fowles), all rolled into a gripping story of growing up and finding meaning in life. The multiple first-person structure (wonderfully easy to follow) is pure writer's genius. (I fell in love with Adah!)"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Certainly a great book exposing how one culture whether miles apart or continents apart do not understand one another. I have a son who has an austism spectrum disorder, and although this book is not even close to anything to do with autism or any other kind of disability...this book somehow made me able to \\"see\\" how one set of people does not understand another and for no particular reason, other than they are different from one another in such a way that one cannot possibly comprehend. I'd say if you arent reading it for the actual story, and you know of someone with a disorder, try to think of that person as a 'native' and you as the 'colonist' as in this story and you may have your answer or be able to pass it along to someone else."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"One of my favorite books of all time from one of my favorite authors.

I'm excited to read other Kingsolver novels!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I'm going to have to study a bit more to separate fact and ficiton - don't know if I still \\"like Ike\\" after reading this. Ms. Kingsolver effectively lends distinct voices to her characters. I missed the father's voice, though, and wondered what he would have written. He's a charicature which left me wishing for more depth from him. Perhaps this fact strengthens the voice of the women in this tale - makes them more real. Amazing in detail, very compelling and achieves success in allowing us to peak into the hearts, minds and culture of the people of the former Belgian Congo."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I hated to see this book end! I wanted it to continue following the lives of the family that lived (lives) in the Congo. It's VERY interesting and educational all at the same time. The author has an interesting way of writing each chapter through the eyes of one of the characters. I have to say that when I started the first chapter, I almost put the book down. It was in English but hard to understand what it was saying. There was a reason for that which you'll learn as you read more chapters. I usually don't keep fiction books but this is one I enjoyed so much I'll keep it so I can read it again in the future."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I just finished reading The Poisonwood Bible and it has instantly become one of my favorite books. The style of writing is vivid and poetic. Barbara Kingsolver is a master wordsmith, writing sermons, prayers, poems, and palindromes. In one sermon, Nathan Price declares that Jesus is Bangala. He means that he is most precious but because of a mispronunciation it sounds to the villagers as if he is saying Jesus is poisonwood. She blends in words and phrases taken from Kikongo, the language of the Congo as well as French. The storytelling is amazing and unique. Each chapter is written from the perspective of one of the main characters. The foibles and quirks of each character come to life in the telling. It is an absolute must-read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is a story about a Baptist minister who takes his family to the Belgian Congo in 1959.As with many of the books that Oprah has chosen to be part of her infamous book club, The Poisonwood Bible is a fictional story that has a darker aura.

I've read many excellent books through the years but this was one of my favorites. Even when stories don't \\"grab\\" me and hold my interest, it's hard not to enjoy good writing. Kingsolver does both. She's an excellent writer, and she tells a stunning story. Having been a preacher's daughter myself, I ordinarily would not be drawn to reading about missionary life in the Congo. But \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" is life-changing as the reader lives vicariously through the eyes and hearts of a mother and her four daughters who struggle to survive in a foreign culture. The overly-zealous, abusive father is the personification of what Christians DO NOT want others to think about Christ and his church.

As hard as I tried I just couldn't get into it.I am never without a book and will read just about anything I can get my hands on, so I'm surprised that so many people gave this book rave reviews - I just can't see the appeal!In defence of Oprah's book club, the best book I have ever read is &quot;I know this much is true&quot; by Wally Lamb. If you read one book this year, make it this one!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"i began this novel capitavited by the themes. africa, missionaires, the congo in the time of independence, religiosity, politics, culture immersion and dissonance. i was unfamiliar with barbara kingsolver's work, but the general happy hailing the novel was receiving in the press, and the richness of the subject, pushed me to purchase.i have to say i'm disappointed. i don't know where to begin. to have such a great story, one harbored for years inside her, as kingsolver has said, and fed with her own experiences as a child of African medical and public health workers, and to result in such a wash of pop style and excess, is a regret.just some thoughts. her editor should be fired. since this book sold well, i doubt they will be. a good author was betrayed by the editor and herself. the writing much of the time is popular(as in, go with the first word you think of while writing), at best. occasionally, it is flagrantly bad and irritating. most of the characters, in fact, are seriously underdeveloped. a hard achievement in 543 pages! kingsolver spends to much prose describing the mix of cultures, often repetitively, and with only surface insight or circumstance, or the easiest angle view to achieve. astonishingly, the few actual events of the novel that occur (as in plot) are left minimally tended. particularly, one deeply saddening loss. the political exploration is the simplest of presentations, even on the character level.i could go on. indulgent to poor writing, excessive description, pop psychology, a casual, anti-intellectual writer, few actual situations and events driving the narrative(i felt like i was reading a screenplay in paragraph form), and an endless redundant, descriptive style.i would suggest not reading this. save your time. i would recommend 'the catastrophist' by ronan bennett, which i read right before 'poisonwood bible' a recent novel of the congo at the time of independence. sharper, literary writing, a good story and a good presentation of complicated politics manifested in personal lives, both black and white, african and european.sorry, ms. kingsolver. this reader knows writing novels is hard work. (that's why i'm willing to pay so much money for them). you're a success. with talent like yours, don't squander it. don't let another great idea for a novel get so compromised. find a new editor(a tough one) and if it takes an hour to write a good paragraph, stick to the same one for a whole day! then maybe we'll be reading kingsolver in fifty years. if that's not what you want, maybe you can option the screenplay, but get a percentage of the profits. it made bruce willis a multi-millionaire!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I was really expecting this to be a great book. I'd first come across Ms. Kingsolver when I read her Prodigal Summer about five months ago, and absolutely loved it. It was a great, well-written story, and despite the fact that I came out of it feeling a little bit used, I could not wait to sink my teeth into this one.The subject matter made it even more attractive. Like Paul Theroux's \\"Mosquito Coast,\\" this one has an atypical American father taking his wife and family into a jungly, tropical wilderness to carve out a new life. Perhaps more exciting was the idea of getting a glimpse of an utterly foreign land, seen through the eyes of people with whom we can relate.It is told in the first person in alternating chapters by the mother and her four daughters, and although it takes a bit of getting used to, it works. Each of the five has an identifiable personality and a distinctive voice. It gets off to a flying start: within the first twenty pages the family is dumped into a steaming, isolated part of the Congo; a ramshackle group of hovels right smack-dab on the equator. They get off the rickety plane and are immediately surrounded by a mob of sweating, chanting natives, pushed and pulled to the church where a large animal is roasting, then handed chunks of it and other horrible-looking gruel on tin plates. Nobody even has a chance to change their clothes.This is just the beginning, and things don't get much easier. Father, a zealous, bible-thumping preacher, proves woefully incapable of relating to anybody, and his efforts to convert the Africans are ineffective and ridiculous. In fact, every idea he has, from planting crops to baptizing converts, is disastrous. The family tries to cope in a myriad of ways, but the African continent is almost too daunting. There are days and days of unbearable, steaming heat, causing drought; followed by days and days of pouring rain, causing flood. There is the brown, dirty-looking river infested with crocodiles. There are snakes and wild beasts in the jungle. There are insects everywhere, mosquitoes and flies and beetles and even a wild, scary ant invasion. There are the diseases: sleeping sickness, and elephantiasis, and malaria. And then there are the people, whose customs and language are almost incomprehensible, and who occasionally exhibit hostility to the white strangers. (All are fascinating, though. In the skilled hands of Ms. Kingsolver they come across as unusual, three-dimensional, individual, and completely believable.)In the middle of this Belgium announces that the Congo will become independent. Everyone expects chaos, and the family is told in no uncertain terms that they must leave. It will be too dangerous to stay. But Preacher Dad isn't going to go, by God. He has a job to do. So they stay, things get even worse, and the family begins to disintegrate.If you think this sounds interesting, you are right. It is great stuff, culminating in a disaster that even the all-suffering mother can't take, and the family decides to get out, with or without father. Their escape, through mud, mosquitoes and jungle, also makes for a fascinating story.But at this point, with about 150 pages or so to go, the book pretty much runs out of gas. The plot dies, the characterizations end, and a long series of thinly-disguised lectures begin, apparently in an effort to enlighten the pampered, overfed, rich and ignorant Americans most likely to be reading this thing.You see, we overthrew the noble and democratic Lumumba in 1961 and installed the horrid, greedy, and despotic Mobutu, all because we were afraid of a little communism (small C). The communists, don't you know, feel that all people deserve to live in their own house. Everybody! What's wrong with that? And if that wasn't bad enough, we then stupidly backed the opposition group in Angola against its wonderful democratic leader, but at least the brave and noble Cubans came over to help him. How TERRIBLE it is to be an American, and how ashamed we all should be.And look at the shelves in American grocery stores! Filled with useless things, like shampoo, and carpet cleaner, and shaving cream. Why should anybody need these things? People in Africa have NOTHING! What a bunch of arrogant, overfed, ignorant morons we all are!Okay, I get it. In fact, I'm even willing to admit that there's bound to be a little truth in what Ms. Kingsolver says about our incessant political meddling. And yes, okay, coming back from Africa after two years to the plenty of America had to have been a disorienting experience. But for goodness sake, can't she try to make it a little more even-handed? Is it too much to ask that we get even a tiny little glimpse of what the other side of the story might be?Even worse, she sacrifices one of her characters to overbalance the political argument in her favor. Rachel, clearly the most superficial of the sisters, is nevertheless an interesting, fully-developed character early on. But in the later chapters she is distorted to become selfish, ignorant and racist in order to prove the author's point about ugly Americans, and furthermore to set her against her nobler, more Africanized and therefore oh-so-progressive sisters. It is too much.Much too much, and really a shame. The book is a flop. And it didn't have to be. If the talented Ms. Kingsolver had simply and quietly illustrated the fascinating differences between Western and African cultures, the reader would have been allowed to draw his own conclusions. Instead, we are spoon-fed a bowl of ill-tasting and indigestible propaganda, and told in no uncertain terms that the world will be a much better place when white people are no longer left in it. Please excuse me if I choose not to jump on this bandwagon."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"My sixteen year old son bought this book for me for Christmas on the advice of the sales clerk. He told the clerk that I was an avid reader and would probably like something with a christian theme. I can't imagine that she, the clerk, has any more of a clue than does Ms. Kingsolver. At first I was totally engrossed in the lives of these women. I am at once a mother, daughter and sister. And a child of the 50's. If this book were a tale of the entertwining of lives, the rain and shine of existence..one that could be told on any continent in any era, then the first part of the book was absorbing, even though the author does not include an ounce of how true faith can affect our lives. The second half left me wondering if the author was a man-hater, America-hater, dictator-hater...what? The entire history of mankind is filled with similar stories of injustice and outrage. However, I STILL was forced to look at myself squarly. So, maybe she got her point across anyway. If, as others suggested, she were to have written two separate books, a tale &amp; a treatise, I probably would have only read the tale. And then, would I have asked my God, &quot;What can I do?&quot; or would I have just thought, 'nice story, a bit sad, but oh well, that's life&quot;.

Before you judge me for saying these things, please notice that the great majority of the book's reviewers have feminine names."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kingsolver doesn't welcome me with hospitality in the first 200 pages of The Poisonwood Bible (For my first adult novel it was the most pages I ever read and difficult for me to relate and get into the story). The first half of the book seemed to go on and on describing Africa, that was a cram of description for me-details on details about detail and more details. Who knew 200 plus pages could go on and on describing Africa's people, customs, and landscape and still include a story embedded within elaborate description?Don't get me wrong the descriptions were well written and Kingsolver style with words were avid. I felt she wrote a picture worth a thousand words, her words helped me picture Africa with it's color and primitive beauty that seemed to flow off the pages(seeming too heavy for the pages to support). Once I got accustomed to Kingsolver's language and it began to flow off my tongue easier, I began to feel like I was on the same page. I'm glad I persevered, because now I have a greater respect for English class and it's attempts to broaden my horizons. I couldn't imagine a future of having my hand writing, \\"She can feel the touch of his long, curled tongue on the water's skin, as if he were lapping from her hand.\\" It must have taken Kingsolver a great deal of time and research to write The Poisonwood Bible, the descriptions, Bible verses, politics, Adah's backward poems, geography of Africa, and the Price family's journey.The beginning of the book was an uphill climb for me, familiarizing myself with Africa and the Price family. For me, the pace picked up. It then became in the down hill reading -words rolling off the pages becoming pictures in my head. With information that Kingsolver thought necessary, I was able to follow along with what was going on with the Price family. It didn't seem like we were spending forever on one topic and there was less jumping around from one setting to another, which at first was very confusing. In the second half, Kingsolver wrote about politics and places I never heard about, Kingsolver made all the necessary information available to me, helping me understand the Price family's story.Kingsolver didn't break me in easy to adult reading, but The Poisonwood Bible turned out to be a good read. I got through a 649 page book and I'm now ready for more challenging reads. The Poisonwood Bible is a book for people looking for a story about life discovery, politics, nature's strength, and the value of open-mindedness, acceptance and forgiveness."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I thought this book was lovely, truthful, and ambiguous enough to be great literature; it's just that we are so used to hearing the propaganda of the &quot;other side&quot; (white, Christian, male) that any fragrance of dark, pagan, female knowledge is extremely threatening (to many writers on this list, anyway). It is true that the character that draws all of the women together, and all of them to Africa --Nathan --is a one-dimensional character (and as one reader noted, Rachel also threatens to become one-dimensional in the latter half of the book). But Nathan is purposefully one- dimensional. Compare him to the central character, Singer, in Carson McCullers' _The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter_. This novel is structured similarly to _Poisonwood Bible_ in that it alternates among several characters' perspectives, there is no omniscient narrator. Also, Singer, a deaf visitor in town, is the one who draws them all together and influences all of their lives. This is an example of a central character that is relatively silent, yet who strongly influences all the other characters. You could argue that _Poisonwood_ might be a more perfect book if it had drawn Nathan more sympathetically --my own rageful father is also capable of great love --but this does not take away from the truth of the fact that his rage, his dominance, his control damaged some lives, including his own."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"To read Barbara Kingsolver's ambitious and beautiful \\"The poisonwood Bible\\" is to travel to another time and place - being Belgian Congo, circa late 1950s. At the center are the Price family: the father Nathan, a Baptist missionary, the mother, Orleanna, and their four young daughters. He is the only one really interested in going to Africa. His aim couldn't be other if not to convert natives.Each of the four girls and their mother are the narrator of the novel. We see the travel, Congo, Nathan, life in Africa and Religion through their eyes. They didn't have a choice. The haven't moved because they wanted to, but they couldn't say I don't want to go. Life changes dramatically once they are in the other continent. If in the beginning they focus on practical changes - lack of comfort and treats they used to have back in the USA - and they spend more time in the new home, the changes get under their skin, subverting their characters and world view and religion.One of the major challenges that Kingsolver certainly had to face was to create distinctive personalities and, above all, dramatic voices for each daughter: the oldest Rachel, the twins Leah and Adah, and the girl Ruth May. To be grow into a woman and a dutiful daughter in Africa should be the obligation of each of them. But they subvert the expectations that life and their father weight on their shoulder.Rachel represents the material culture. Comfort, expensive and fancy clothes, exquisite food and so on - these are what she misses most. Early in the novel, she complains turning sixteen away from home, and not having a sweet sixteen. Adah's physical condition makes her a special observant - sometimes bitter, but never dull or accurate - of her family. Ruth May, being a child, is the most open to the new experiences. Deprived of fear or prejudices she can make new friends easily;And then there is Leah, the most complex character in the novel. She is exactly what her father wants from a daughter - dutiful and God fearing. Her observance of the new life and family dynamics brings to her character and the novel a nobility. She is the novel's - and the family's - conscience. When politics take the center stage in \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" is through Leah's eyes and voice we get the most perceptive comments.Nathan is a character alienated in his own world - no matter where he is. Religion plays the most important role in his life and to convert the natives is his lifelong duty. Neglecting his wife and daughters bring disastrous consequences. he doesn't become friends with the people of their village, and is never able to enter into its heart.When Congo becomes an independent nation, \\"The poisonwood Bible\\"'s narrative becomes denser and complex. Kingsolver is able to combine political changes with its effects in personal lives without neglecting the dimension the subject demands. Her complex prose takes the reader to another place and time, guides us, but also leaves us freed to explore by ourselves."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I was given this book as a gift and enjoyed every moment.I first assumed the story was of a black family, but discovered I was wrong.

I HIGHLY recommend this novel."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible, unlike most current literature, follows the points of view of five unique women's (all of the same blood) congolese experiences. What intrigues the common reader about this highly detailed novel is that the story is not told by a single narrator, but by five (all of which are females). While reading this intellectual novel, one is overwhelmed and taken aback as Kingsolver uses this unique writing technique to further immerse the reader in the Congo. Kingsolver also manages to add a slew of themes (such as, mental suffering) which create a strong foreground for classroom or personal argument."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Thoroughly enjoyable and highly readable. Great characterizations, unique plotline and lavish attention to detail make this a book you'll hate to put down! And you'll hate when it's over. Author Kingsolver masterfully speaks in the different voices of her characters and structures the story with magnificence. Buy a second copy to give as a gift."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"To describe the utter frustration over the way this book was put together is very difficult. The first part is enticing, full of rich, sensuous images and well defined characters. The second part of the book in no way matches the storytelling power of the first. Homer's Odyssey works the same way, telling first the story of Telemakos and Penelope, then the actual journey of Odysseus and then the tale of Odysseus' return to Ithica. Throughout the Odyssey the reader is treated to a feast of sensuous detail and a list of characters which could almost step off the page. While I am not juxtaposing the two books, I am trying to illustrate that when a work involves the telling of a story which has already completed itself, the detail and emotional level must be the same throughout. There is a loss of the cumpulsion to want to turn the page in the second half of the book. I think the second almost reads as if it were meant to be a sequal, meant to have it's own thematic climax. Read the book knowing that it will slow and become a labour to read at the end, but it does tell the complete story of each character by the end."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I loved the first half of this book, but the second half seemed stuck on to me, like it was development work she did to understand her characters, that grew so large she didn't want to toss it. I felt it dragged on. Maybe if it was shorter, it would have read better, but I felt it needed a second climax, if she was going to devote so much of the book to that part of the story.The first part of the book is very absorbing. The other reviews articulate what is great about this book so well, no reason to say anything more about it.BTW, I took anthropology from Barbra Kingsolver's sister, Ann, in college!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book follows a family of 6 (father, mother and 4 daughters) into the heart of Congo, where the father will work as a Baptist missionary about 40 years ago. The mother obediently follows her husband and so do the 4 girls, ranging in age from small child to teenager. Each chapter is written from the perspective of one of the females, which makes the book very diverse and enjoyable, because the same incident can be seen from different angles.We read about the time the family spent in Congo, but also what becomes of the females of the family in later years. The tone is very well set: the description of the stifling heat in Congo and the stifling power of the father almost makes you feel it.All goes well that ends well, but things are not going well from the beginning, mainly because the father refuses to accept that different cultures do things differently for very good reasons. So the seeds drown in the garden, the people refuse to come to the church and even the birthday cake is not what it is supposed to be. The father's power is slowly but surely eroded by the events that take place and leave their mark on the rest of his family.The six characters are all completely different. The unbending father tries to convince the villagers that Jesus is love, pronouncing it in such a way that it comes out as &quot;Jesus is poisonwood&quot;, a local plant that can give you an immensely unpleasant rash. The eldest daughter is stupid and superficial (leading to hilarious misuse of difficult words), and even though she stays in Africa for the rest of her live, she always remains an outsider. The tomboy middle girl for a while really tries to please her father until she falls thoroughly in love with the continent and especially with one of its inhabitants. Through her accounts we are able to follow the sad history of Congo. Her bright but handicapped twin sister returns to the USA, but somehow Africa has made a lasting impression, which influences the choice of her career. And as for the youngest daughter: read for yourself..."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I have to admit that I am not a fan of the Oprah book club. I picked up this book because friends recommended it to me. And, now that I've just finished reading the book, I am amazed at how powerful it really was. It is an epic story about the human heart and the human condition.The Poisonwood Bible tells the story of family of missionaries that leaves America to go change the world of the Congo in 1959. The father, a religious fanatic, puts his beliefs before his family, something that will become highly fatal both for him and his family (his wife and four daughters). As their lives becomes entwined with the political situation of the Congo as well as with the lives and beliefs of the natives, their souls become drenched with despair and desire to return to their homeland.So it comes as a surprise to see the decisions these women make when they grow up and try to deal with the teachings of the Congo. The book spans over four decades, starting in 1959 and ending today, told from the point of view of the daughters of the mission priest. These girls are as different as night and day; the author gives each of them a very specific voice and tone.I have to admit that it takes time to get into the narrative (it took me about a 100 pages to really get into the book) and that the book does run on for a little too long near the end. But overall, The Poinsonwood Bible is an amazing book about the power of life. It tries to tell us that what we learn in life is invaluable and that we are each our very own individual that is defined by what we learn through our life experiences."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is about a Baptist evangical father that takes his family of four daughters and his wife to the Belgian Congo to spread the &quot;word&quot; of Christ to the natives there. The family is totally unprepared for their new life in the Congo. The father thinks he can convert everyone and his tactic for conversion is often times forced and actually turns against him. However, his daughters fare much better in the Congo, from Leah befriending the villages teacher, and Ruth May bridging the gap with the younger childern with a simple game of &quot;Mother May I&quot;. As the family settles into their new lives in the Congo, things start to go wrong. From dealing with the pains of constant hunger, floods, drought, killer ants, and diseases, the family realizes the Congo was nothing that they expected. Their lives in the Congo dramatically changes with one catastrophic event that pinpoints the opposition of most of the village to Nathans bullying attempt at conversion to Christianity. From then on, the family is forever changed and all of them go there separate ways. The rest of the novel chronicles the lives of the daughters and the mother and how they struggle ahead with their lives with the overshadowing of one event that had changed it forever. The book is a wonderful book and written well with the differentiating voices of the daughters clear and precise. Be careful though, it's a long book and alot of political opinions. All in all, I enjoyed it and missed the characters when I was finished"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible was enchanting. The realism and frank viewpoint moves slowly, but the annecdotal and entrancing subject matter keeps it moving quite steadily. It's like eating chocolate slowly. The story is told through the eyes of the four daughters, ranging in age from 5 to 16. The two middle daughters are twins, one being a girl with disabilities and slight dementia. Once in a while, the mother will also have a chapter or so. The story is told and continues from every viewpoint, and so each chapter, though having a different narrator, is a continuation of the story instead of a repetition. The story is spellinbinding. It incorperates a viewpoint of history unbeknownst to (majority, to be politically correct) of the modern world. The indepdence of the Congolese from the Belgan government is not only told from the eyes of the mother, who understand the political element, but the eyes of the five year old, who sees the trauma and celebration indepdence can cause. This book, in some reviews, was called to feministic. Though, yes, it is told from the perspectives of five females, and yes, it is written by a female author, I think this a false alligation. Having read the novel, it's interesting how this patriachial family is really ruled by the women in it, despite the father's (who is an angelican protestant minister) moving the family to the Congo. It's a rude awakening of the dedication of some people, who will risk their own, and their entire family's life for one cause, be it religious, political or any other form. This is the theme woven throughout the pages of this novel. I believe this book can be thought about and read by both clergy and atheists, for its &quot;stand back and look at things&quot; viewpoint can lean either way, and being a person with little religious background, I not only depended my understanding of religion, but also saw the other side of things too. I'd like to add, I'm 13 years old."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"My first Kingsolver novel. Reading this book is much like the journey taken by the price family: Long, interesting, laborious, and ultimately rewarding.Kingsolver developes her characters incredibly well. We are annoyed by some, intrigued by others, and are moved deeply by their stories. Her characters never stray from their personality, and sadly, also fail to grow much (with the exception of the daughter with a disability--). But you feel as if you know incredibly well by the end of the book.Her prose and pace are even and her word pictures draw you in and you can see through her eyes, feel the jungle above you, hear the hum of the mosquitos, smell the dank air of the village.There are important lessons to learn in this book--one of open-mindedness, humility, and true Christianity; however in the end those conclusions are skimmed over and the focus settles on a political theme.Still the writing is excellent, the journey through the book a worthwile one."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Every now and then I read a novel that, no matter whether the subject matter is tragic or comic, I just hate to see end. Usually it is a story of a diverse family and I become so absorbed in their lives that reaching the end is like being disowned, cast out no longer to be an intimate. This was true for The Poisonwood Bible. It is a peerless look at one family and how, basically, it grew, nay, flew apart caught in the torrent of one particularly turbulent time of modern history. The Prices are led by the zealot humorless missionary father into the heart of the Congo, 1960 just as the climax is reached of that country's colonization. Barbara Kingsolver makes familial and colonial politics interact and parallel each other. Tragedy is utterly inevitable; one only waits, in much pain, to learn its specifics.The tale is recounted through chapter to chapter alteration among the mother and four daughters. The voices are aptly distinctive from the cunning but willfully ignorant eldest, Rachel through the two gifted twins Leah and Adah (the latter of whom is idiosyncratic because of being born with apparent brain damage) to the youngest whose fearless and childish musings are no less insightful and revealing of that special time and unique place. The mother's parts of the narrative are mostly looking back from the 1990s and it is from these that the foreboding descent into tragedy becomes most evident.In the well crafted background is a tiny rainforest community of unthinkably poor and colonized tribes-people. Kingsolver avoids political correctness and preachiness in showing,, episode by episode, how the villagers' wisdom and spirituality so greatly exceeds the missionary's. This is a story of individual and family love. It is also wonderfully informative on the political economy of the Congo (and I am sure the truths are no less relevant in the post-Kabila era as they were in the time around the assassination of Patrice Lumumba (January 1961). Kingsolver is also a biologist and she uses her impressive knowledge of rainforest denizens to poetically teach about the natural ecology of this stunning but troubled piece of earth."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I think a lot of people just assume that if Oprah recommended a book that it must be wonderful. I had heard so much about this particular book that once I finally got around to it, I was expecting an inspiring and enlightening story of strong women and a new insight into Africa. I found that it was none of these things. I thought that for most of the book the women were exceedingly weak. In the later half, I didn't find their lives believable in the least. I persevered to the end, but felt that Kingsolver didn't live up to her potential in this disappointingly long effort."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"There are books, and some of them are good books, some of them are not. Then you have literature, and only a few books can fall into this category; Snow Falling on Cedars, To Kill a Mockingbird, Of Mice and Men, and now, The Poisonwood Bible. I have never read a book that consisted of such beautiful writing. Does anyone write a better sentence than Barbara Kingsolver? Those of you that find this book too wordy don't realize the complexive beauty of her writing style. This novel can be rated with the best works of the 20th century, and maybe surpass some of them. Kingsolver tells the story from the viewpoints of five individuals, a mother and her four daughters and details their experiences on their father's mission to Africa. But of course things do not go as planned and as stated very early one of the daughters falls to death and the chain of events sets of the discourse and downfall of the family. Redemption, a main theme, is discussed in this book with each character searching for it, even the reluctant Adah. Reading this book is reading a masterpiece, and don't kid yourself that it's &quot;too wordy&quot; or &quot;too descriptive&quot;, because if you feel this way than you cannot appreciate the beauty of writing."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I don't want to take pot shots at some of the smaller flaws (Rachel's narration, some of the shoddy narration for the first quarter or so of the book, an overwhelming amount of Kingsolver's political analysis) because overall I was very impressed with the book. It's been a while since I've read such an ambitious book with such an epic scope, so I have to hand it to Kingsolver who did spend 20 years doing the research. If anything, the sheer heft of the book gets in the way -- the first 100 pages are SLOW -- then the narrative picks up. After hundreds of pages, we have an abrupt transformation to post Africa and what each child is doing. The last 100 pages or so are not nearly as vivid as the middle. A bit anticlimatic in fact. She's best when she's describing day to day routines and behaviors -- not as good when she's adding her political views.Despite some flaws, it's quite an accomplished book in lots of ways, especially the creation of such memorable characters like Adah and Nathan. At least it's a &quot;pop&quot; book that has some depth and texture. Those who rip it apart should try some Richard Paul Evans first and then go back to appreciate Kingsolver's enormous tapestry."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I am almost finished with this book. It is an very good read--it has held my attention quite well. Some of the reviewers believe it is too PC and anti-Christian. I do not see it this way--it simply questions whether we, as Christians, have a right to shove our beliefs down the throats of unwilling participants and whether we should be endangering our families in the name of Christ. Some things simply can't be solved with Christianity. Many Christians have a bad history of doing this in the name of Christianity--and I consider myself a rather devout Christian! I highly recommend this book for both education and entertainment. I loved the characters in this book--even Nathan. I see a screenplay in the works!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book was definately a 5 Star for the first half - I couldn't put it down!! Although I have an interest in politics of Africa, I found the last part to be a bit dull and even preachy. It is like reading two separate books. Even so, the first part is so rewarding, I would strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Well, If you have come this far (reading this review), you already know what the book is about. Let me tell you how I felt after I finished this book. Exhausted! Melancholy! I needed a nap! I further felt like exploring more of the history of the Congo. I was a child who's knowledge of anything to do with the Congo was limited to the pictures in National Geographic. I have been exploring other mediums of history on the Congo since I put this book down. I bet you will too! What else can I say? Read this book! It will enrich your life!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Originally, I was going to reject this book because I found my first Kingsolver experience, \\"Prodigal Summer\\", to be a drag quite frankly. However, a friend of mine loved it, so I figured I would try it. I am glad I did; once I started it I could not put it down.This story is about a family consisting of a mother, minister father, and four daughters aged 5-16. They leave the comforts of their American home to arrive in Africa so the father can perform missionary work. This story is told almost entirely through the eyes of the four daughters, adding a richness not experienced in books told in first person, third person or omniscent style. Every word they utter tells you exactly how they feel, and they take you right to Africa with them where you see a world so different from the one we have in the USA. The girls grow more in that year and a half in Africa than they do during the rest of the time the book spans.The tragedy in the book was very real and moving to me. It also resulted in a final chapter of the book that made me cry, but also experience the closure that the family sought. You are not left hanging, and you experience a diety that is much more gentle than the one Mr. Price worships.I would recommend this book to anyone, but particularly women/teen girls that have sisters. This book will make you more grateful for these family members than anything else ever could."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I am a type of person who has to get into the book within the first 40 pages. If I don't get hooked, I know that I will not like it. I gave &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; three stars because it does have a good message, but I did not like how long it takes to get the point across. I recommend this book to anyone who has patience, but if you are like me and want to know the meaning of the book from the beginning, make another selection."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I love this book, I liked it so much I used it to write a very important paper in a college english communications class that resulted in an A!@!!!! Barbara Kingsolver is so brilliant, this book really makes you think about your life in general. It really touched me since I grew up in a christian family and have always heard about missionaries, everyone should read this book. I want to go to Africa because of this book.. . I would love to personally thank Ms. Kingsolver for writing this book. My personal copy is well loved, highlighted and has even been to the beaches of mexico, I love this book!!!!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is one of the most amazing books I have read in a while. It is very involved and very deep; make sure you have the time to really sink your teeth into this one. It is an elaborate tale of a family of a father, mother, and 4 girls who travel to the African Congo as missionaries. The father is a Baptist preacher who is to convert the natives. Each chapter is told from a different perspective. For example, one chapter is told by one of the daughters, another from a different daughter, one from the mother, and so on. The writing is phenomenal. Definitely a book to buy. A+."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Let it be understood, all ye who enter here: Barbara Kingsolver is a Yank through and through, as American as apple pie and wormwood. This magnificent, ghastly, unfair, and transcendent novel places Kingsolver at the forefront of American literature and specifically as the latest classic practitioner of that most American of genres: the Southern Gothic. In fact, what she has done in \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" is to bring the Southern Gothic home to its origins in slave-trading Africa. Understand that, and one will be able to swallow the book whole, just as it is meant to be, while coming out shaken and morally reversed, just as one is supposed to do.To say this is to say that while John Leonard was correct in comparing Kingsolver to Nadine Gordimer and Doris Lessing, the comparison hinges on his identification of Kingsolver as an American writer of postcolonial literature. Gordimer and Lessing write with patience: a detachment and insight born of being born guilty and having lived with guilt over long, productive lives. They may suffer from it, but compared to Kingsolver, they don't complain about it. As such, they have a more authentic hold on the actual experience of reckoning without being able to reproduce it one-tenth as overwhelmingly for the reader. What Kingsolver does, much like the Faulkner she most resembles in this novel, is to immmerse her reader in the experience of atonement to such an extent that when we begin to question what the Price family is paying for, the answers--cogent in themselves--have the frustrating effect of seeming somewhat beside the point. The political arguments between Leah (the nearest person to a hero) and her sister Rachel (one of the most frightening fictional villains of all time, in the skin of your average 1950's Redbook girl) are interesting, even convincing in large part, but in the context of what has gone before, they sound just a little as if Job and his comforters were climactically debating the relative merits of skin balms and delousing agents. \\"Oh, Rachel, Rachel,\\" Leah bursts out, before starting a lecture on the ruin wrought by world capitalism; I may not be the only reader to have heard its echo as \\"Oh, Goneril, Goneril.\\"All this, however, may be the point, too. The Southern Gothic is unique among genres of American literature in being able to afford bathos; it takes itself seriously enough to be able to take itself preposterously. The world-improving agendas of writers as diverse as Faulkner and Flannery O'Connor have sounded hubristic before, when reduced to brass tacks, and come out sounding all the more Biblical for their sense of the ultimate futility of efforts to root out original sin with good intentions. No wonder that missionaries are the ideal Southern Gothic subjects. The bathos of the Prices' downfall only adds to its grandeur. In point of fact, what the Prices do in the Congo is unpleasant, but petty and precisely beside the point; none of them, even Rachel (potentially a more powerful emblem of prerevolutionary negritude in her blank whiteness, her unstirred passivity, than the assertive near-monster, Leah), is bad on anything like the scale of the engineers of Lumumba's death, or their parallel in the bigoted witch-doctor who brings about the novel's most tragic episode. This event, though horrible enough, is (as Kingsolver would remind us) not on the scale of the fate of the Congo: the fact that we're made to care about it as a form of divine retribution, and accept all that follows more or less sheepishly, is an example of Southern Gothic technique at its most masterful. None of it would work if there were any nice people in the book--not excluding a saintly child, saintlier Father Flanagan, and brave African rebel from central casting. As Stephen King writes of the Southern Gothic denouement in another context: the odds are evened; \\"the [protagonists] pay with their lives. The problem is that the reader may think the dues paid were just ones.\\" The problem, but also the solution.None of it, also, would work if Kingsolver's prose were not able to sustain its gorgeous heat, reminiscent of Sylvia Plath and Andrea Dworkin, over the course of nearly 600 pages. This is a feat in itself, making up for the fact that we are never allowed to identify with the character whose mad righteousness should give us an insight into the attraction of missionary evil: Nathan Price. It is a subtle choice on Kingsolver's part to permit us to do so only through his daughter, Leah, most like him of all, and finally most opposed to him. If other characters in \\"Poisonwood\\" exemplify other deadly sins (Orleanna, despair; Rachel, sloth and avarice; Adah, envy; Nathan, wrath; and Anatole, just possibly, lust), Leah exemplifies Pride, naturally the most tempting of all to the engage. Leah is humbled with the rest. By novel's end she realizes that all she must do to rid herself of whiteness is to adapt to a changing world, rather than saving it; it's perhaps excusable that this is only the penultimate revelation, the ultimate being a sentence in praise of Communism--Communism, not socialism. (Really? Everywhere in the world? Surely a chronicler of shattered dreams can do better.) Leah should know better, but she doesn't; perhaps a sequel could take her up on it. But one of the requirements of the Southern Gothic is that it allows for no sequels. Any affirmation sounds pale at the end of a novel of such total condemnation, and an affirmation of a truly noble, truly lost dream is probably as good as any."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I was enthralled by the character development and the insights into jungle life. The relations between the family members and the villagers were most interestingly presented and further developed over time. I could but only marvel over the author's genius. I loved the characters still even in the last half, which many reviewers decry. However, the characters assembled become gradually Luddite, and this may reflect the author's own personal philosophy which may be viewed from her inspiration references which include Al Gore's Luddite environmental work. Still nevertheless, I accepted the Luddite philosophies of the characters because the author displays them with such ease and rationalizes them, given the conditions of those characters. Having read many reviews herein, the author does make historical mistakes, so I would like to say that her characterization of the Portuguese Catholic clergy as slavetraders is false. Her favorable view of the Cubans in Angola is overstated. Many Cubans returned from Angola infected by some of the diseases that Adah observed as native to the region. The author is not afraid of the Marxist-leaning leaders even in Angola. She cleverly avoids marking the leftist government of Angola as saintly, yet only in Angola in an agricultural quasi-commune, may happiness be found. I think that the author is clever in the insinuation of the Luddite and leftist thinking into the thinking of her characters, because the experiences of the characters justify their conclusions. Am sorry to see that so many reviewers found errors of contemporary fact and of Christian religious practice. Yet this is a great tome, and I gave it four stars because some of the historical errors detract from a great read. I love the subtle aspects of some of the observations of the characters, the insights into language usages, the poetry, and the changes in development of some of the complex villager characters."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"People who say this book is awful need to read it again. I am a picky person and I don't read many novels although I do enjoy reading, but the first sentence grabbed me. I must say I am quite anti-religion and being the granddaughter of an Episcopal bishop felt \\"put upon\\" when my mother's friend, an extreme Christian, put this book in my face and said, \\"Read it.\\"I opened it and there was the first sentence: \\"Imagine a ruin so strange it must never have happened.\\" I had to go on, trudge through this thing that I thought I would hate, yet I must say now this is one of my favorite books I have ever read in my short sixteen years of life and I've read quite a few (although this coming from someone who thorougly thinks War and Peace is great and people look at me oddly for that one).My father told me his stories of being the child of a missionary in the same era in Africa and thus I was compelled to read on. Nathan Price's views are not offered here, yet they need not be, for the characteristics of this novel are the voices of the women. I would NOT say this is a feminist novel. I would say that it's a book of self exploration and degredation, of what has happened these past years, the cruelty and the intrigue and corruption all over the world. Life isn't perfect and it sure as hell wasn't in the Belgian Congo in the 50s, believe you me!But this book is great. It drags a bit at the end and people whine about how Rachel says \\"jeez oh man\\" at age fifty, but, Rachel's the \\"stupid one out\\" of the characters. They age yet in ways no one would expect due to their trials in life, especially poor Leah and Adah. Kingsolver has yet again created an epic out of a story out of reality and man I feel like reading this again."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book is so amazing. I could not recommend this book enough. Everyone in my house has read it, and everyone has cried, laughed, and felt for the family within the story. I absolutely love this book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I think the rest of the reviews cover it, I just want tosupport this book. It is both educational and emotionally driven without the fluff. Excellent read!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is about a Southern Baptist, Nathan Price, who moves his family to the Congo to work as a missionary. Kingsolver creates a clear view of the Congo through narration by Nathan's four daughters (Rachel, Leah, Adah and Ruth May), who each have unique experiences. While Nathan struggles to convert the community of Kilanga, his daughters grow into strong, opinionated young women. The Congo has a truly lasting effect on the family. The book is very riveting and suspenseful. The family is trapped in the revolutionary atmosphere of the 1960's Congo. It is only after tragedy that the family finally disobeys Nathan and attempts to exit the Congo.I truly enjoyed this book and highly suggest that you read it!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I LOVED THIS BOOK! It is literally my favorite book of all time. I chose it initially because I had read and enjoyed Barbara Kingsolver's earlier works of fiction. This is her best novel thus far. I traveled in Africa a couple of years ago, and this book brought back all the happiness, guilt, anger, fear, and sorrow that I had long since pushed from my mind. Africa is a tricky place to discuss; most people think of the game parks or maybe the Sahara. Kingsolver manages to correct these assumptions. She personifies the region so well that one can easily find themself &quot;in&quot; the book, involved with the true-to-life characters. I read all 543 glorius pages in one weekend! I simply couldn't put it down. It is a masterpiece, and will be enjoyed by all."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I am an avid reader and I put this book way up there with Gone With the Wind, which I was reading in the delivery room in 1974. I couldn't put either book down. I know that this author spent 4 years researching for and writing this book. She wanted it to be historically factual and I believe it was. This is what made the book so great. I could picture being there in Africa with this missionary family and could relate to all their trials and tribulations, but better yet, I got a real lesson on what the US role was in helping the Congo become &quot;free&quot; and how in reality &quot;we&quot; sordidly raped this land and violated the peoples living there. You don't want to miss reading this book. I was surprised and disappointed that it doesn't have 5 stars, because it should really have 10!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"When I started this book, I just couldn't put it down. The story was so interesting and the depiction of the Congo and the missionary family intrigued me. The author is truly poetic and weaves a wonderful story with beautiful imagery. I also thoroughly enjoyed the way she narrated the story, from the viewpoint of several characters (the mother and daughters). It helped keep the story moving and strong, plus you were able to really delve into understanding the characters more deeply.I have to agree with a few of the other reviewers, sometimes the narration was either shallow and annoying, or wierd and dark at times, but I believe that was the authors way of really showing character development. Some people are shallow and annoying, or dark and irritatingly artistic and deep...and a couple of these characters were at times.BUT, than I got to the last 1/4 of the book, and found myself skimming!!! I loved the beginning, how could that be? Kingsolver, just went on too far to tell the after effects of the Congo's experience on the girl's entire lives. It became a bit boring actually...quite a contrast to the start. I also have to agree with the other reviewers that mentioned the overuse of political narrative about Africa and it's history. It wasn't necessary and I found myself drudging through the last quarter of the book because of it. I am not a big fan of a lot of history in my fiction novels...sorry.All in all, I think it was a good read, and also quite deep and thought provoking, but watch out...the end may get too long for you too. It is still worth reading...I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is the first of Kingsolver's books that I have read, and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. Her characters were well drawn and complex. Her descriptions were vivid and the story was engrossing.My one complaint was that the book seemed to climax about three-quarters in, and then it just leveled off. However, I would still recommend this book to any and all."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"&quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; is a powerhouse of a novel, brillantly executed. Barbara Kingsolver uses multiple narrators to tell the story of an American missionary who takes his family to the Belgian Congo in the last days of colonial rule. It is compelling reading, there are many memorable scenes and images, and several very suspenseful moments. The characters, both the missionary family as well as the local Congolese, are well drawn. The book's historical background is equally interesting. This is a must-read for anyone who enjoys a good novel, even moreso for anyone interested in Africa.There have been few English-language novels set in Congo (Zaire), but two of them (&quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; by Joseph Conrad and &quot;A Bend in the River&quot; by V. S. Naipaul ) rank among the best in English literature. &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; will take its place alongside these classics. Taken together, the three novels tell the story of the Congo in the 20th century: Conrad's story covers the early Belgian Congo colonial period; Kingsolver's novel is set at the end of the colonial period and the coming of independence; Naipaul's novel is set during the rule of Zaire's first strongman Mobutu Sese Seko.&quot;King Leopold's Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in Colonial Africa&quot; by Adam Hochschild is a non-fiction approach to the story of the Belgian Congo and its aftermath."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I recently saw that Oprah has selected this book as her Book of the Month. Normally I don't agree with many of her selections - but in this case I do. Kingsolver has created rich, believable characters. Each character has her turn at describing the events that she witnesses. What I found interesting is the recurring events, being told through different characters and how they, in turn view and process what they witness/encounter.Without giving too much away - I can say that the book is laced with excellent uses of symbolism. The witting is easily understood and at times, you can hear the distinctive voices of each of these ladies as you begin to read their story.There is a message contained within the story and it is not difficult to pick up on it - and if you think about it after you read the book - you will find yourself referring this book to other people."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"My Christian book club read this book, and we were facinated with the range of characters. The father was burning to preach to the &quot;heathens&quot; as he thought they were, and the Mom was just a wonderful-style 50's Mom, who just wanted her four girls to have a birthday cake in deepest Africa! Each girl has a distinct voice, from the oldest, self-admiring daughter, to the disabled daughter and her twin, to the baby of the family. I raged at the prejudice of &quot;ugly Americans&quot; from that time period, and prayed that there would not be such prejudice today. I thought the ending was weak, but I enjoyed seeing what happened to the family in later years, after much revolution in both their lives and their adopted country."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is one of the few books I've read in the past couple of years that created a whole world for me, showed deep insight into a wide variety of characters, provided the structure of an epic novel, and resonated with the greatness of classic themes. I would put it on a short list with works like Anna Karenina, Heart of Darkness, and A Thousand Acres. It was one of the few books I've read that gave me insight into my own values and cultural blind spots and made me question how I will spend the rest of my life. I will read it again."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"When I first started reading this book I couldn't put it down. I found this chronicle of evreyday life of four American girls growing up in the Congo very engrossing. The way Kingsolver was able to so effectively write in five different voices was amazing. The characters were all so distinctive that there really wasn't a need for all the chapters to be labeled with the name of the girl writing it. The chapters by quiet brooding Ada I devouered yet savoured as I read through her palindromes backwards and forwards. Rachel's chapters were the most amusing with her twisted sense of reality and her missused words and phrases. I found myself most frustrated when reading about Leah, the leader who so desperately wanted to follow. It was Ruth May's chapters that made me smile the most as I read about a stubborn, bossy little girl that never came to realize that she was the glue. It was after the Price girls left the Congo that the story lost some of it's magic for me. Part of the reason I was so involved in the first half of the story was that it was so detailed, no event was brought up as an afterthought - it was like a play-by-play. The second half seemed more rushed. I was forced to take a more passive role as a reader as I no longer felt a part of the story. And dear Ada, my favorite sister who reemerged as Adah, seemed placed on the back burner. I was able to forgive this when I read the last line in Adah's last chapter, the definitive line, &quot;I am born of a man who believed he could tell nothing but the truth, while he set down for all time the Poisonwood Bible.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver has written an amazing story of a southern missionary family in Africa. I would recommend it for the disfunctional family story or for the setting in revolutionary Africa. Together it's a complex, well written, compelling read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I just finished reading this book. What a refreshing change of style from the average novel of today. Exquisitely researched, but it did not bog down in minutiae as a Clancy novel would. Although I don't agree with Kingsolver's apparent politics any more than I do Steinbeck's or Orwell's, she presents the story so compellingly that I didn't seem to notice (unlike Grisham's Street Lawyer which whined and preached from each page). Destined to become a classic. I'll not soon forget the Price clan, just as the Joads' live on in my heart. Thanks Barbara!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Exquisite. Although the African world may be what lures the reader in, the family dynamics is what holds the excellent story together."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Although any writer with a huge political agenda to dump out in between plot and characters usually scares me to death, Kingsolver doesn't. Her earlier books deal mostly with Native American culture, supression, and injustice; now she takes on Africa in the Cold War. It's been called the war that wasn't a war, but we only mean it wasn't a war on the American front, and at last someone has brought to life the tragedy of the third world, the people through whom the Cold War was fought. Kingsolver has been criticized for attempting write 'what should have been a black woman's story,' but I find that she writes exactly what she, as a white American, can -- the story of the Congo through twentieth century American eyes. The division of worlds is excellently drawn, and the religious musings as well as the political commentary is fascinating. Still, the characters are, correctly, the core of the book. Their voices are convincing and their development is wrenching, as Africa shatters and sometimes rebuilds each of their lives in ways true to the individual. As Rachel's denial is preserved and Orleanna's shattered, as Leah finds her own way to flourish and Adah at last learns to deal with reality, I found myself seeing a piece of myself in all of them. Beautifully crafted work."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book holds special meaning for me as someone who has also grown up overseas. The joy and sadness associated with life in and out of a foreign setting are very real and understandable as are the ways that everybody deals with their attachment to Africa.And, although all 5 of the major characters in the novel are women, Kingsolver avoids overdealing the feminist cards. However, she does get a little preachy herself (like the character of the father) when she takes on the subject of the U.S. and the Congo, however true she might be.All in all a very good novel, though, from a fellow overseas traveller."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Funny (learning a new culture), Scary (disease,plagues etc). Interesting to read about the life of missionaries and the take over of the Congo in the 60'S and 70&quot;s. Written from the perspective of 5 very different women who went with their father and husband to save the africans and learned that they were more changed than the africans."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"A joyous, yet heart rending account of individuals caught in the societal structure of the time;( 1959 Congo) not only as female members of patriarchal conservative missionary family, but also as unprepared visitors to an area in Africa, swelling with beauty/devastating poverty and political upheval.The stereotypes shatter under the weight of harsh realities and those involved come out the other end of the venture having endured too much, yet having become more strong and understanding.Incongruent as this comment may seem, this book if filled with good humor as expressed by the four daughters of the missionary family. I &quot;read&quot; this book in the unabbridged audio version. The &quot;reader&quot; has a lilting southern touch which ads a depth to the characters. I felt they became my friends. At books end Africa seems no more majestic than the regal characters brought to us by a wonderfully skilled author."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Having just returned from Africa, I was hungry for more about the mysterious and facinating continent. Kingsolver is my all-time favorite writer, so I was delighted to read the book and savored its length and detail. Now, I need something else to read but fear that nothing will satisfy me as this book has. I feel a great deal like I did when I finished The Handmaid's Tale. Thought provoking, troubling and delicious book, makes me want to talk about it to everyone. I love the evolution of the characters and the history that I learned from reading. I am still wondering what to read now. I hope to use this book in my high school literature classes."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I was captivated by Barbara Kingsolver's latest book and couldn't stop reading it. As a US citizen who has lived overseas for the past eight years, I identified with some of the frustrations encountered by this tragic family. I felt it was an excellent commentary on the evils of colonization - how white men have tried for centuries to impose their wills, and their religions, on indiginous people who neither want it or can benefit from it. I cried to think about how a beautiful culture was tampered with by outsiders, not only in the Congo, but all over the world."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"For days after reading Poisonwood Bible, scenes from the Congo came to mind, little snippets of the mad minister's deep misunderstanding of the people he tried so hard to &quot;save.&quot; To the reader, his conservatism is maddening, as is his autocratic family rule. If you've ever watched a conservative preacher yelling out his message, you will recognize him in this book, yelling louder and louder to get his message across. The format of changing narrator with each chapter was at first irritating to me, but soon forgotten as each character grew when her voice was heard again. This is a wonderful book, a must-read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"A truly great read from the perspective of African Congo history. The story was told through the eyes of four, very different sisters. It was well written, and a beleivable story on most all counts. Kingsolver did her homework, and it shows.This is not an easy read. It's challenging and requires some focus and determination. It was more a history lesson for me, than a story of a family experiencing tradgedy and healing.I recommend it and only caution you to be prepared for a confusing and long journey through the lives a dysfunctional family."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is an interesting story of a family thrown into turmoil by their move from a Southern state to the Congo. Motivated by the Father's rabid belief that only through Christian baptism and beliefs could the local people be &#34;saved&#34;, the 4 daughters and the wife become distanced from him and begin to question his judgement. I found the book interesting and enlightening until it turned into an anti-American rant during the last fourth of the story."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Nothing I could add to the praise this magnificent novel has already garnered would add anything that hasn't already been said: so consider that I'm only adding a flower, basically, to the splendid bouquet already presented in appreciation of this richly deserving gift to great literature and the readers thereof.This novel is a throwback to the days when writers sought to encompass an entire world and a view of that world into their work. It would not be hyperbole, as it so often is with comparisons, to think of \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" in the way we think of \\"Moby-Dick.\\" Christian missionary Nathaniel Price leads his unprepared family of less-than-willing women into Africa with the same tragic single-mindedness that Ahab led his crew to pursue the white whale. So it is that Kingsolver, like Melville, expands her plotline to cosmic proportions, making \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" a vehicle to meditate upon nothing less than the human condition in its awful and heartbreaking entirety.Historical, political, personal, spiritual, this novel does what so few novels dare to do today: it offers a vision of the whole human comedy from inferno to paradise. By daring to fail big, Kingsolver has captured a prize few contemporary authors even acknowledge is still there for the winning. To look outside themselves and beyond the dramas of their own little lives to grasp the world in its ungraspable entirety and try to make some sense of it--that is the endeavor of the artist in it's most exalted sense. In \\"The Poisonwood Bible,\\" Kingsolver accepted the challenge and, with few flaws and missteps given the reach of her ambition, created a towering work of high art that also manages to be highly readable.The \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" has surely got to be in the running as one of the truly defining novels of our time."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"A missionary family goes to Africa, cultural differences are misunderstood, hilarity ensues.

Why should Tata Ndu, the chief take a guy seriously whose 15 year old daughter hunts to provide for his family?The story is told in sync by Nathan's wife and four daughters. I love all of the sisters. My favorite narrator is Adah the witty cripple and wry observer. And Orleana's sections are some of the most beautiful bouquet of words I have ever heard.She really grows as a woman in the Congo and is finally able to live a life of ones own.The history of the Congo during the late fities early sixties is very interesting. It made me sad what the U.S. did in the name of Greed. It shows that our god in America is GREED.I was disapointed by the last part of the book. It was just too rushed and laid on too thick .All the of the characters except Orleana have become Cartoons of what they were. Made me mad that Rachel became such a narcistic ,racist old bat. I liked her at 16, even with all of her flaws. She stood up to her father and stayed self sufficient and kept a sense of humor. And Adah's story was just to idealistic to be true.I was also disapointed by the author's ignorance of religion and the fact that all of the characters were athiest by the end of the book. Ms.kingsolver Doesn't seem to know anything about the Catholic Religion or Primitive Baptists.I went to a primitive Baptist school and knew some fathers like Nathan. It was a bad experience,but I still believe in God. (Kind of the way Brother Fowles does) It was like the author had this agenda for what her readers should believe. In the end and felt she was beating me over the head with it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I'll start by saying that if Amazon's star system were out of ten, I'd give this book nine. It's a truly engrossing, beautiful novel with only a few things keeping it from being the masterpiece. Rather than focusing on the plot, as several others have done, I'll focus on what I liked and didn't like about it.I decided to pick it up after Stephen King said it was one of the best recent novel's he's read, and then was disappointed when I read the back cover, because the subject matter didn't really interest me much. But when I started to read it, I was instantly captivate, and that held throughout the novel, which I read in about a week.The Pros: The characters in the novel were some of the best, most realistic characters I've encountered in recent literature. They were subtly and fully developed, and all had distinct personalities and outlooks. My favorite of the four girls was probably Adah, mostly because her narrative sections always had a very different feel than the rest. Her outlook on things was unique and incredibly interesting.It was good that to my admittedly limited knowledge, she was historically accurate, as well as accurate in describing the landscape of Africa. I know some, but not too much, about the history of Lumumba and other political struggles, and she seemed to be very accurate with it.Kingsolver's writing, simply put, is astoundingly beautiful. The words honestly flow off the page, and blend seamlessly together. It's a rather long novel, but her writing makes it flow really fast.The Cons: I think it was Salon that reviewed this book saying that it had the potential to be great, but that it felt shrill, and she was too quick to condemn, rather than understand, evil. I actually agree with quite a lot of that. There were times I felt, particularly with Nathan, that she should show a different side of him, rather than just a cruel religious nut hell-bent on converting all of the Congo, for reasons that are too quickly and not satisfyingly enough justified. This is a very minor, knit-picky thing, but I feel it should be brought up.One other problem is that while the last 150 pages or so are good, they simply aren't as great as the rest of the novel. It might just be me, but I felt that way. It was still just as interesting and well written, I think I might of just been because towards the end Adah wasn't as unique as she was in the rest of the novel.Kingsolver's themes, while good ones, are sometimes exhausted, and are sometimes made a little too obvious, I feel. I think they should have been more subtle at times. Ones again, knit-picky, I know, but I still feel they should be pointed out.Fortunately, the good things in this beautiful novel strongly outweigh the bad things, and it's still one of the best books I've read this year. Kingsolver gives good messages, but usually isn't overbearing. Overall though, it's a good, entertaining story, and I recommend to anyone who loves fiction in general."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Dear Ms. Kingsolver,Your book,The Poison Wood Bible, took me into my past. I am an MK(missionary Kid)I was born in Korhogo, Ivory Coast,(then French West) West Africa in 1948. I am a third world kid, neither African nor American in culture.Your book reveals the dogmatism, religious fervor, the western mindset of the 'great' missionary movement. It uncovers the reasons for being, that exist in many sectors of mission denominations, namely....to \\"save the lost at any cost,\\"(My phrase.)My parents went to Africa in the late 40's. My twin and I were born just 8 weeks after their arrival, poor Mom!As we grew to school age, we were shipped to boarding school in Africa, to Guinee(then a republic)3000 miles away. We stayed in that place of horrors for 9 plus months out of each year, four years straight. Each four year term was interrupted by a one year stint in the USA, for fund raising at supporting churches.We grew up in boarding school starting at 6 years of age.The dialogue of each family member in your book, from mother to each child,is striking. I see and remember things I had forgotten with each chapter. This book resonates with my life in personal ways.I am writing my own story.I am tying together the issues of abuse and their impact not only in my life and the lives of an army of missionary kids who are now grown, to the Native American boarding school experience. There is linkage between our histories.You have brought the glory and terror of living in a foreign country for years at a time, to the fore front of my mind.Thank you!Nyinge (third daughter)aka Vivian Harvey"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"To read a summary of The Poisonwood Bible does not give justice to its complex originality. Watch. A fiery Baptist preacher with flaming red hair, an albino late teen daughter who must fake an engagement to a diamond smuggler to avoid arranged marriage with a Congolese chief, a smart younger teen daughter who becomes an expert huntress causing a village riot, a brilliant twin to the huntress who is crippled, mute, and nearly devoured by a lion, a youngster daughter who won't take her malaria pills, an African ant infestation the likes of an old Testament plague, and more. Sound like a whole heap of soapy melodrama? It's not. Cleverly narrated through the interchanged voices of the four women who accompanied Brother Nathan Price to the Congo in the mid-twentieth century, The Poisonwood Bible delivers rich prose, haunting images, and deeply respectful political and spiritual insights. While I agree with other reviewers that the political science talk was not a welcome interlude, the majority of the narrative bespeaks storytelling at its finest."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"For a brief time, I was there. I saw the green mamba snake in the tree. I was with the eyes in the tree. Did it ever really happen? Can we look away from the truth? The girls all told the truth, but each was a different truth, filtered through different eyes, melding into different spirits. Mother child sister daughter. Who is to say whose truth was right? Even the slanted truth of Adah rang as true as any. And the truth of the children sang through it all. How long can another keep that in her pocket? Children's tongues spoke the truth. I never wanted it to end."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"An excellent book that grips you from the start.As I am not religious I had a few reservations about reading it when I saw it was about missionaries, but the story is essentially about their family life in the Congo and the dangers they faced. It is written from the point of first the mother then each of her four daughters and is very skilfully done. I love this author and this is one of her best. It is entirely different from anything else she has written."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This story is told through the internal voices of a mother and her children as they are conscripted by the head-of-the-family to go on a religious mission to Africa.Each of the family members into whose minds we enter has a somewhat distinctive voice. But they all are strangely literate voices, down to the youngster in the family, hardly more than a toddler. So they all immediately strike the reader as different shades of the author's mind. This sort of ubiquitous autobiography is almost impossible for a fiction writer to avoid. But in this case, such self-centeredness comes off as a virtue. A reader can soak in the polished thoughts of an author of superb intelligence, soak in the words - such words as never seem to come out of the everyday people one meets in real life. So this book can be read as pure pleasure, as an escape into a salon of fine minds. In that sense, it really is fiction. But it can also be read as pure pain - as a factual account of the crushing problems experienced by all the people of the Congo in the throes of colonial rule.This is a wonderful, memorable book. There is only one drawback to reading it; and it has only one flaw in its writing.The drawback is that it plays into the mounting pessimism about Africa's plight. Many African-American leaders in particular object to the current representation of the Continent simply as a place of problems. And this book can only increase that sense of Africa as being an irredeemable, almost cursed land. There is ultimately no celebration of African culture here - no sense of the possibility of triumph. Africa is experienced as an all-downhill experience along a slide of megalomaniacal leaders, of dangerous beasts, of nature's adversity in the form of alternate droughts and mudslides. Perhaps as a result of this depiction of unrelieved misery, Kingsolver might perpetuate a sort of racism, when surely it is her intention to do just the opposite - to show how humankind is welded together by universal tragedy.The one flaw in the writing of the book is that the father in the family is given no voice. We do not hear his inner reflection and philosophizing. We do not get an insight into his motives. He comes off only as viewed and judged by others - as a religious fanatic who impresses the rest of his family into service to his vision. And it is so easy, almost inevitable, to make the one who is not known, the one in whose shoes we do not walk - the villain of the piece. If to know all is to forgive all, it is the father who is the most unforgiven here, and he therefore becomes the biggest victim of the story. So for all her command of the English language and all her ability to find the right phrase for every nuance of sentiment, Kingsolver perhaps arrives at a second unintended consequence.However this is still a very good book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Despite the excitement of finally seeing another Kingsolver novel in publication, I did not rush out to buy this book when it finally hit the stores. After reading a synopsis of the book, I decided that this story wasn't for me. I can't express how wrong I was! I LOVE THIS BOOK! My entire self was consumed with this book, these characters. I found them whole, with a range of complexities. I NEVER became bored or lost. The smells, taste, languages, thoughts, emotions, etc. - everything captivated me. I look forward to savoring it again. I recommend this book to my friends and anyone else who will listen.To Barbara Kingsoler: You've created a wonderful bit of work. Thank you."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Thouroughly enjoyable novel by a great writer. Kingsolver totally sucked me in and made me care about every character. Highly recommended for its expose of life on the other side of the world"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This was a great book for me. I enjoyed the weaving of the story and the voices of the different characters. The whole while I was reading this it reminded me of the many devoutly religious &quot;fanatics&quot; I knew. Thanks to Ms. Kingsolver for bringing these characters to life for me. I look forward to reading other works by her."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book was truly ambitious, the story unfolding through no less than five different voices. I loved the biblical imagery: Patrice Lumumba as Christ-like figure, Adam &amp; Eve/serpent imagery, etc. Kingsolver brings the full measure of her wit and character development abilities to this book to make it an absorbing page-turner as well as a substantive read. I've never read anything of Kingsolver's I didn't like (and I've read all of her books) however, in my mind, she now joins the ranks of twentieth century greats such as Jane Smiley, Margaret Atwood, and A.S. Byatt."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"&quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; is the most absorbing book I've read in a while. I agree with readers who say it was difficult to get into, but I'm so glad I stuck with it. She managed to make each narrator a total person, yet universal so that I could identify with them all (except Nathan Price). I enjoyed some of her earlier work, but I LOVED Poisonwood Bible for what it has taught me about history (that I'm ashamed to say I should have known about), human endurance, and the old &quot;East meets West&quot; nexus. I am absolutely in agreement with its philosophy regarding how missionaries or other outsiders relate to native cultures. Reminded me in parts of Elspeth Huxley's &quot;Flame Trees of Thika.&quot; We white Westerners have a lot to answer for in our arrogant attitudes toward so-called Third World countries and also in our appalling ignorance about Africa and the diversity of its own countries and cultures.Congratulations to Kingsolver for her important, educational, soul-touching, and just plain entertaining book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kingsolver's novel is a rare, wonderful combination of intellect and emotion. Readers who &quot;just don't get it&quot; must be the &quot;Rachels&quot; of the world. It is not the sort of novel one finishes, because its lessons live on in the mind and in the heart."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Having read all of Kingsolver's previous works, I was a bit apprehensive about how she would do with a change of period and setting. Although slow to get into (stick with it - you'll be glad), this tale of the Price family successfully weaves a story that is equally about family, God, politics and race. Although certainly not perfect (often didactic), what impresses me most about The Poisonwood Bible is that it continues to be thought-provoking long after you have turned the last page. Perhaps even growing richer the more you think about it!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I liked this book from the first paragraph. I knew that the author had the ability to write in an intoxicating style from that first chapter. I was disappointed a bit with her Rachel character. I didn't think we needed to be repeatedly slapped in the face with how self absorbed she was. That was the only drawback to this wonderful story. I loved her Congolese, and all the other female characters in the story. I learned quite a bit about recent African history. This was a very good tale. Take this book with you on your summer vacation and let yourself be consummed with this story and these people."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"In The Poisonwood Bible, Barbara Kingsolver has painted a broad and deep fictional portrait of a family of innocents abroad in a very real world they neither control nor - at least initially - understand. She has also painted a very clear picture of that world as it actually existed and unfolded. Although it is possible to quibble with certain aspects of the telling of this story, I nevertheless found this to be compelling and deeply satisfying reading. The author tells the story of a rural American religious missionary whose personal demons lead him to drag his family of five women (a long-suffering wife and four young daughters) off to the African interior (the Belgian Congo) in 1959. The story is told through the women's voices, and very distinctive voices they are. One is intentionally obtuse and materialistic and consistently quite irritating, the others varied, interesting and generally quite perceptive in their own ways. The history of the world in which the characters find themselves is itself at least as complex as any of the characters themselves, and is - in my moderately educated opinion on the subject - true to the actual course of modern African history. The novel, in fact, pulls no punches in describing the nature and consequences of Western (and especially American) involvement in Africa through much of the period from first contact through at least the mid-20th Century, and this is likely to stick in the throats of readers who like their history sugar-coated. Ms. Kingsolver has brought recognizable and articulate American sensibilities to a clear-eyed story of private and public betrayals of trust and, in so doing, has done her readership a real service. She has also told a wonderful story. If some of her readers are uncomfortable with that, then so be it. Thank you, Barbara."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book was not easy to read but well worth the work. The different perspectives add much to the telling of the story and had quite distinct voices. I am still processing the book -- there were so many levels to consider -- the history, the relationships and the personal growth of all of the female characters. This definitely did not contain any strong or growing male characters. The good ones were one demensional and the bad ones were evil women haters. I was moved to tears, thought, outrage and to read the book again."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I had been anxiously awaiting this new Kingsolver novel and looked forward to delving once again in the Southwest culture which she brought to life so vividly in her previous novels.I was initially disappointed when I discovered that the subject of her new novel was Africa. It took a while for me to get into the &quot;flow&quot; of the book but when I did I was delighted. She made each character believably unique. My only criticism is that the final chapters became political lectures which were tedious and unnecessary."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"As an audio book experience it was very rich. The different characters each had a cadence and speech pattern that was immediately identifiable. Rachel's malapropisms got wearying and Scarlet O'Hara - like. Adah's reading and talking backward fortunately stopped near the end of the book. The Congo has never interested me very much but after reading this book I'd be much more interested in reading more about it or even going there. The last quarter of the book is why I didn't give the book 5 stars: it is a diatribe of narrative completely unrelated to what has gone before. If I'd wanted a biased history lesson I'd have reached for nonfiction. All in all it was nice to have the 5 girls/women do the storytelling, even if Ms.Kingsolver never did get into the nitty gritty of how they handled first menstruations and other rites of passage that were oddly ignored in a novel rich with mundane uniqueness. I have read the author's other books and found this one to be a treasure. But next time Barbara, trust your readers to draw their own conclusions - even if they do not agree with yours!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I find myself with the need to research. After completing Kingslover's The Poisonwood Bible, the library calls me for more reading. Perhaps this is an author's greatest accomplishment: to stir us to learn more. With a wonderfully sketched story of a missionary family in the heart of the Congo, Kingslover has brought to the forefront of her reader's mind a country which all to often escapes the page of history textbooks. In the literary sense, Kingslover has excelled. Her tale, told through the eyes of five individuals, is able to capture five different reactions and five different attitudes to life in the Congo. Therefore, Kingslover creates an almost omnicient story-telling capability. But, besides the story, politics seep into her writing, specifially in the final chapters. This is where I question her tale. This is why in feel the need to learn more. If Kingslover's goal was to send us to the library, in search of more information on the Congo; she succeeded. But, if this was meant to be an all-encompassing plot, heralding the history of the Congo, I am afraid she left too many questions in my mind. I desire to meet her after reading this book. There are so many symbols and theories that I fear I would need her explanation. But,my mind has been provoked. Thank you for a taste of a world so different from my own."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I just finished this book and I loved it as I knew I would. The physical description of this part of Africa and its people was lovely in its detail and respect for the subject matter. I also enjoyed the way the book was written, through the voices of the different women. More than once I was moved to tears. Ms. Kingsolver is a terrific writer.I did have some problems with the simplistic politics. While I enjoyed the history lesson, it screamed for balance. Leah reminded me of so many white guilt types I found in college, as I studied international relations. I don't argue that the white man brought great despair to Africa, but please, we're not the source of all evil. Ms. Kingsolver's attempt at balance, the girls' reunion at the Abomey palace, wasn't enough. Leah cut the natives a bit too much slack when confronted by Rachel about all the death in that palace.World history is full of individual villains and saints and lots of people in between. Leah's worldview is too black and white and not big enough. The actions she railed against made sense to someone else. I'm not defending colonialism or despotism, I'm just saying that history tells many different stories. Who you are and what you have lived color what you remember and believe.In the author's world, the darker you are the more noble you are. The world is a little more complicated than that. Ms. Kingsolver's political voice in this book reminded me of Isabel Allende in The House of the Spirits, another great book. Her description of Salvador Allende was just a little too whitewashed to believe.The book is great, but don't let it define African history for you. The story must be more complicated than presented in this book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kingsolver has topped herself with this one. I have never been so moved by a novel. The book is not only outstanding because of what she says, but how she says it. With brilliant writing and remarkable facts, Kingsolver's book is a joy for anyone to read. I only warn people to read it when they are sure they have the time.

I found the book extremely easy to read, and even easier to enjoy.I really enjoyed the books diversity...using each girl's/woman's perspective to narrate different situations. I particularly enjoyed how the characters evolved into completely different people as their experience in the Congo affected them. They became what they never expected.This was not the best book I have ever read, but it was close. I found myself enjoying the authors choice of words, as well as her symbolism. I definitely forgot myself, and became an observer of the family as it struggled in the foreign environment of the Congo."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I must be the exception rather than the rule but I didn't enjoy this novel. I highly anticipated the arrival of Kingsolver's newest book. Although vivid in description of the Congo and its lush surroundings, I found it difficult to like the characters.The story seemed to jump to much and at times and tended to get way to &quot;wordy&quot;. The book was purchased in October and I just finished it tonight.(this is very rare for me to take this long) I found myself hoping the story would pick up and for me it just never did. To sum it up.....250 pages would have been sufficient to tell the same story. &quot;It just wasn't Bean Trees&quot;."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I loved the way Kingsolver narrated this story throught the eyes of these four women, each with a unique perspective. I feel so enlightend by her descriptions of the Congo and the people who inhabit it, that I hope to travel there one day. The coming of age of these young, Southern girls under the conditions in which they live is worth reading even if you may disagree with her political points of view. I loved it!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Ok, so Animal Dreams is also on that list. I'm so impressed that Kingsolver took such great risks with this novel and succeeded.

I loved the narrative structure: chapters written in first person from the point of view of a different daughter. Each daughter is well drawn and very different from the other three. I could not put this book down and stayed up late two nights in a row to finish it. I wish they had more than 5 stars that I could give!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"In this book the portrayal of the characters generally follow this unfair pattern; if your a woman you are good. If you live in a third world country you are good. If you are a white male you are bad. That's kind of it in a nutshell. Also, this book attacks the United States. Personally, I'm tired of this kind of hatred directed at me and my country. In this book the US can do no good, no matter what. Negative, negative negative.

The product I received was of very poor paper quality. The pages were unevenly cut and as a result I will be very wary if in the future I consider purchasing another book from Amazon.

Anyone who would purposely seek out the input of a cowardly murderer to critique their book doesn't deserve to get it published, no matter how good it is."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Please don't buy this book unless you don't mind 200+ pages of Anti-American, Pro-Communist diatribe! The first part of the book was okay, although I found the voice shifts irksome after a while (okay, only Adah's). Perhaps most tiresome, though, is the attempt to have the Price family be the embodiment of all whites (the Prices were especially bigoted and ignorant).(FYI, Barbara Kingsolver, not all Christians are evil missionaries. The last part of the book tries to imply that anything Christian is bad.)The second half, however, was highly annoying with it's continual Anti-American sentiment. But funny, too, because of the hypocracy of the author: (1) Just because the Congolese do things differently than Americans doesn't mean they're bad or stupid: they're just different, so don't judge. (2) Anything done the way of American norms is not Congolese and is therefore BADYOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS!!!Perhaps the saddest thing was that I didn't care a fig for what happened to the Price women"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book was okay but I really can't understand all the tremendous hype. For my money (which isn't much) the character I liked best was Nathan. The women were weak, simpering fools and, as a former reviewer noted, it is hard to identify with fools. I wish the author had done more with Nathan. He was strong. A real man. I liked the way he dominated the women. But Kingsolver rarely let us see much of this enigmatic and fascinating man. Had the book focused on the wonderful character of Nathan and his thoughts and feelings I probably would have given it five stars. But it was still an interesting story."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This rating has nothing to do with my opinion of the book. I am less than half way through it and, therefore, have not performed an opinion of it. It was, however, highly recommended to me."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book was so good, I've had a hard time enjoying any other book since I read it. The writing is fantastic!This story is about a missionary family that travels to the Congo during the late 50s and early 60s, to spread the word of God to the natives. The narrative alternates between the mother and four daughters, which keeps it very interesting. How does Kingsolver manage to write in 5 voices that are so very different?The family arrives in Africa with all of their 'worldly' possessions--Betty Crocker cake mixes and all, and immediately set about showing the natives the proper way to get things done. As the story progresses towards an overthrow of the government, a powershift within the American family takes place as well. The Congo, as well as the missionary family, will be forever changed.If you enjoy writing that contains an excellent narrative, lots of historical research, and layers of symbolic meaning, you will really appreciate this book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This was the first Kingsolver book I'd ever read. Several of my college professors were reading it and talking about it, so I decided to give it a try. Having lived overseas myself as the child of missionary parents, some of the issues in the book hit very close to home. I understood the cultural faux pas and the shock of moving to a strange new world, and Kingsolver's portrayal of these things was believable. It is not the best written book I've ever read. The multiplicity of voices at times makes for a rather cluttered narrative, and some of the word play gets a bit annoying. The techniques Kingsolver uses are not highly original, but it is a good read because of the conflicts it presents"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is one of the most thought provoking and thoroughly enjoyable books to come out in the last ten years. I finished it last night and have already sent the book off to my mother so that she can see into the lives of these women as I did. Ms. Kingsolver's use of the English language was wonderful and intriguing - such as the backward/ forward reading by Adah. As some of the other reviewers metioned the book did slow down at the end but how would we all have felt if we did not get to see into the sisters lives in their 30's, 40's and 50's. I would not have changed one sentence in this novel and I thank Ms. Kingsolver for sharing this story with us."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kingsolver has written a beautiful book of women's voices. I believe she handles the different voices of her characters very well, skillfully showing us the different impact the experience of the Congo had on each, and how it shaped their lives. Like others, I enjoyed the book until Ms. Kingsolver switched from story to political diatribe. I believe she conveyed the political situation well through the characters earlier and that her final chapters were simply preaching as if we, like Nathan's congregation, just didn't get it.....so she decided to pound it into our heads, much like Nathan's final &quot;baptizism&quot; of the children. Ironic, huh?"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I am not a writer but a reader so forgive this review if it is too simple for you. This novel focuses on the Price family who are transplanted to the Belgian Congo due to their minister father's, Nathan Price, need for redemption. The novel's first half displays quite vividly what the Belgian Congo would look like to an American family during the 1960's. To say it lacked the comforts of home is an understatement. It also shows how different people, namely the Price women and Nathan Price, view the people of this place. The way Kingsolver writes each chapter with a different voice lets you know exactly what each member is thinking and why. I couldn't put the book down after chapter 3. The second half of the book does get somewhat political, yet because I knew almost nothing of African history it was very interesting. Again, we see Africa through the eyes of Price women. However, it is not the Africa that they first came to and it makes you wonder if it is not the Africa that they once loved. I read this book in my &quot;spare&quot; time, which says a lot because I have a 3 month old so the only sleep I got was from 2am when I put the book down to about 5am. Quite a sacrifice for me an 9 hour a night sleeper."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"In the Poisonwood Bible Barbara Kingsolver exemplifies the art of storytelling. Others writers write prose, Kingsolver writes life. When reading this, it is impossible to not feel for all of the characters; it is impossible not to identify with them. The book has been criticized for dragging on and covering too many years in too little time--this is nonsense. If Kingsolver did not continue the stories of these women, if she ended with their escaping Kilanga, the book would lack closure. Instead, she continues their journey and in many ways, the last parts of the book are the most compelling. It allows readers to see where these fascinating characters go and what they do. The circle of life completes--brilliant. One criticism, no room for a sequel!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"A very well done novel! Both engaging and informative. Kingsolver takes the reader on a journey into the Congo of old via a missionary family whose patriarch is determined to bring Christianity to a people whose belief system expands beyond the confines of that doctrine. His determination to deliver the word of the bible to the people of the Congo results in the total destruction of his family. The novel is revealed through the voice each family member. The characters' evolution is dynamic, realistic and certainly indicative of the skills of a talented writer. Kingsolver intertwines political, cultural, biblical, and historical information in a manner that educates as wells as enlightens. She deserves kudos for challenging the universal applicability of Christianity and examining the virtues of belief systems that sustains its people however non-Christian the beliefs may be. The Poisonwood Bible contains powerful symbolism delivered in prose that is both concise and colorfully descriptive. An excellent novel that deserves all the exposure it can get. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"After hearing Oprah's review and all the praise for The Poisonwood Bible I was really looking forward to reading it. I also must clarify, I use my reading time for pleasure, entertainment and escapism, a time to relax and really enjoy something. So, I thought I was settling in for an adventure and not sheer and utter misery! Granted Barbara Kingsolver is a gifted writer, the reader is able to picture in their minds eye all the characters and scenery very well. But what more could happen to these people? How much were they going to have to endure, it was painful to follow along. And at the end! I listen to people gush about how poignant and inspiring it was when all I could think of was how the characters failed themselves and their families, their ideals and beliefs turned out to be their persecution. But maybe that is why this is a good book, it conjured up all these strong feelings and arguments. It is definitely a thought provoking book but again, not my definition of pleasure reading. Life is difficult and trying enough I don't need to experience it even more in my down time."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The multiple narrators in this book DO make it worth every second of the long read. It gives a view of Africa, and the ruin of a family you can taste. Reading the persepective of five very different women on foreign soil, where they become the minority in a world that does not want to know them, makes the book impossible to forget. I think as far as literature goes today, this book is a great read. It is a little heavy, but definately worth the trip. I am sure many people who have never ventured to foreign soil where they have eaten bugs to survive, and been in a world of unknown can still identify with the madness, and the oppression in this story. An excellent read from a mature writer who is not afraid to share her deepest fears with the rest of us."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book started out great. The subject matter was fascinating, and I enjoyed hearing the story from each of the four daughters' points of view. However, after about the halfway point, it just got boring, suddenly becoming almost solely about politics. If I wanted to read a boring, seemingly endless treatise on African politics, I'm sure I'd be able to find several in the nonfiction section, but I read for enjoyment, not to feel bad. I also found the mother's narratives to be very boring and hard to follow. And please, let's never again be burdened with another character whose mental tic makes her spell everything both backwards and forwards! You'd think Ms. Kingsolver was getting paid by the word."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Really good book! Interesting to read from all different family member view points.

I liked the way the story was told from the perspective of the different characters. It was entertaining and thought provoking at the same time."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"My last review--\\"The Secret History\\"--I enjoyed because of the style of writing. This work was enjoyable, and deeply satisfying because of its content. It is a very rich, deep, and thorough work that few will find lacking. Barbara Kingsolver's opus raises many questions, not only about the nature of missiology, which historically has been the facade to colonialism, but about human nature, how another country's riches can cause a \\"Christian\\" nation to sell its soul. The book is a thick forest, and there are many inroads that intersect in the deep recesses of the forest.Into the forest go the American Baptist missionary, Nathan Price, his wife, Orleanna, and their four daughters, two of them twins. Nathan is out to convert the continent, or at least his corner of it. He has a one-track mind, and even when told the dangers of his mission, he does not relent. It is his demise. It is too bad that there are no redeeming qualities to Nathan, and I wonder if Kingsolver has burnt him as an effigy of Christianity, or at least the way it is usually practiced. The women tell the story of life in the Belgian Congo in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Orleanna relates how the years there scarred her, especially the tragedy that happens. Rachel, the eldest daughter, wants little, if anything to do with her new home, and longs for a way back to life in Georgia. Leah and Adda, the twins, are the ones who learn the most. This is no easy task for Adda, who is a hemiplegiac, partially paralyzed. Ruth is the littlest one, and even she finds a way to touch hearts in a cross-cultural fashion through child's play. The tragedy, when it happens is powerful, and I wonder if Kingsolver stopped typing at that point to ask \\"who?\\".I found the book fascinating. I am sad that Christianity comes away with nothing positive about it. But such is the post-modern view. The book is a pleasure for the senses, and will challenge the squeamish with the encountered dangers it presents. I wonder if there are more books out there that are as plush as this one, and deals with the issues of our time."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book opened my eyes to so many things: the horrible crimes committed by the CIA and the Christian missionaries in the Congo, the ignorance we all have about our own relative wealth, and the amazing talent Barbara Klingsolver has for telling a story (in multiple voices and from multiple perspectives!)."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"For some reason I did not read this book when it first came out.

No matter how hard we try to make it better, life will always suck.In addition to life, men suck.Religion also sucks.The suckiest thing of all is, therefore, life with a religious man.Of course, that summery of the main themes in the Poisonwood Bible hardly does the book justice."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is an excellent and original novel with a unique premise. Four daughters and their mother travel to Africa with their fanatical preacher father, all from the USA, to do missionary work in the 1950's. The story is told in the first person through each of the daughters eyes and the mother's.I learned a lot about the Belgian Congo. Or, at least Barbara Kingsolver's interpretation of the Belgian Congo political situation.I am taking one star off for the lack of peril and conflict through the last 1/3 of the novel. The first 2/3 of Poisonwood are action packed as the family encounters lots of unusual situations and find themselves in a variety of jeopardy. Things get pretty slow towards the end; however, because the reader has already fallen in love with the interesting characters, you do want to read on, even through the slow finish, to find out how they all make out. Because the characters are so humorous, individually unique with voices all their own----great characterization can overcome plot defects later on.Unfortunately, Kingsolver has never come close to the success and acclaim of Poisonwood in her other novels. Both Pigs in Heaven and Prodigal Summer are horrible. Poisonwood is the only Kingsolver novel of hers I would recommend reading."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The five Price women, mother Orleanna, daughters Rachel, Leah, Adah, and little Ruth May tell of their trials the year their father Nathan took the family to the Congo in answer to his mission call. Each of the women tells of her experiences, but this disjointed style does not tie a story together. Each person tells their version of seperate incidents. While the others may refer to an episode, the reader only gets one person's perspective of the incident. A perplexity pervaded as to how the story tied together. By the end of the book, the conclusion was that the story is how the time in the Congo affected the futures of the Price women.Recently it was suggested that this is more of a literary work--the richness of the words and the pictures they paint are the story. Quite true. The reader needs to savor the prose and not rush through the book looking for the tale."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I have read all of Barbara Kingsolver's previous books, essays, and short stories. I enjoyed them all. That is not the case with The Poisonwood Bible. I found this book depressing, preachy, and not at all enjoyable. I felt like reading this book was a penance I was being forced to do. I donated it to the local public library, so maybe I can save some other unsuspecting reader from having to pay for it. I got the message that the white man should not change the Africans way of life, and that culture is a function of environment. I hope Ms. Kingsolver has done her preaching for her career, and can get back to writing that is of the high quality of her earlier works. She does not have the only truth, as the Baptist missionary did not have it in this pitiful novel,"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is the only book I have ever returned to Amazon -- I couldn't bear to own it a minute longer. Kingsolver jumps into new territory with this latest novel and from page 1 you have nothing to hold onto. Chapters jump from one of five characters, Kingsolver's interpretation of young thoughts, teenage insecurities, adult regret is nothing but contrived. I am an avid reader, enjoy challenges, but this just left me wondering who Kingsolver is writing for and why she went so wrong with this book. She's lost one formerly devoted reader."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I read half of \\"The Poisonwood Bible,\\" which was on the top of many must-read lists and purports to be \\"literature.\\" I had hopes of gaining real insight into African culture, and to experience a well-written female narrative (like the voices of Atwood and Diamant). For the first time in 35 years of reading, I couldn't finish a book. Barbara Kingsolver's blathering feelings-oriented tome was, well, tedious, neurotic and sleep-inducing. By the middle of the book, I was hoping the Congolese would strangle the four female protagonists -- to put them out of their misery, for being such stupid pitiful \\"victims.\\" The only victim, alas, was me the reader. The characters were one dimensional, and the tale of shoe-horned Western-Civ gone wrong too often told.

It is a plesantly exciting read and quite intellectually stimulating."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"In response to some outrageously inappropriate methods of international development, The Poisonwood Bible, a solemn work of historical fiction, makes its American audience rethink development. In the last half-century, America has acquired the means to help very many people throughout the world. Unfortunately, she has also acquired the attitude that she has all the right ideas and answers to development problems. In order to overturn American arrogance and to remove deeply held cultural prejudices, Barbara Kingsolver effectively appeals to her American readers' pathos and logos, which help them to question their misguided sense of ethos.Nathan Price is one big infuriating appeal to pathos. A hardheaded Baptist preacher, he decrees that the Price family will go civilize and Christianize the African heathens. He extracts obedience from his wife and daughters, but he does not provide for them or protect them. Instead, he abuses them verbally, physically, and spiritually. He condemns the Africans for behavior that is frowned upon by his brand of Christianity. This is an example of an appeal to pathos because Kingsolver's American audience fears to be like Nathan. He had good intentions and he was firm in what he believed. Readers might initially expect him to succeed, because he possesses traditional American values. But the readers see for themselves the ruin he brings on himself and his family when he assumes he had all the answers. These negative effects of the Law of Unintended Consequences effectively reveals the possibility to Americans that they are causing more harm than good. Some Americans believe the institution of religion, especially Christianity, is universally applicable and useful, and many hold it as authority. Yet Kingsolver portrays the South's edition of Christianity here as a worthless appendage, perhaps even harmful. She does this to break down the barrier of stubbornness that is assembled by a sense of ethos, or deference to authority, when that authority dictates \\"ideal culture.\\"Kingsolver makes another appeal to pathos when she shows the human consequences of America's international policy in the 1960s and 70s. The altruism of the United States is called into question as well as the altruism of the institution of religion. Kingsolver leads the reader to rejoice with the Africans when they gain independence from Belgium and then to mourn with the Africans over the assassination of the democratically elected leader, Patrice Lumumba. This is an appeal to pathos because the reader has formed relationships with the characters in The Poisonwood Bible, so the readers experience what the characters experience. The appeal is strengthened when they learn that America helped orchestrate the assassination. They can't understand why America would oppose democracy and cause so much suffering to those characters they consider friends. In this way the author's appeal to pathos overcomes the audience's sense of ethos. They begin to question the preconceptions characteristic of American developers.I will point out one final appeal to pathos. This appeal turns into an attack on U.S. business, coming right after the attack on U.S. politics. The African perspective of raw material export is shown. \\"Poor Congo, barefoot bride of men who took her jewels and promised the Kingdom\\" (201). Stories are told of the riches of the Congo. It is replete with natural resources such as copper and diamonds, but the Africans don't benefit from them. Instead, fleets of American jets make off with them. Africa still starves. Those characters with whom relationships have been formed suffer because they have no access to their own resources. The very nature of it feels unjust to American readers who, upon learning the true source of African poverty, question the legitimacy of U.S. business.The author appeals to logos by showing characters doing something illogical. The following example illustrates how swallowing American pride would have led to better solutions: Nathan Price is determined he will plant a garden, just like in good ol' Georgia, to show the African half-brains how to farm. He is fixin' to single-handedly solve world hunger. However, his manner of gardening is adapted to Georgian soil and weather patterns. It turns out that Africa is different from Georgia. (Go figure.) World hunger remains unsolved, to say the least. It is logically clear to the readers that Africans have developed methods that work for their land and climate. Readers wonder, with exasperation, why Nathan refuses to also be logical. They learn to respect others' solutions, just like Nathan did not.Another example of an appeal to logos comes in Nathan's obsession with baptism, which shows how obstinacy can be dangerous. At first he tries persuasion to get the villagers to agree to baptism. Then he tries any way he can to con the villagers into the river for the dunking, but they will have none of it. Deep into the book, we learn why Nathan never succeeds. There are crocodiles in the river! Of course the Africans are not going to get in the water! Once again, Nathan assumes that he knows best.When readers see just how illogical a character can be, that character loses credibility. This happens even if that character is the U.S. government. A favored method of the United States is to grant large sums of money to the government. It seems that the United States assumes that all countries run under checks and balances and the sunshine laws and whatnot. They're not all run like that, by the way. In the Congo's case, that money is spent by the corrupt dictator (that the United States placed in power!) for personal extravagance and waste. His cronies also got some of the spoils, but starving orphans and malaria victims never saw any of it. Clearly, money in the hands of a corrupt dictator is not going to his people, no matter how hungry they are. This is undeniable logic for the audience, but the U.S. government fails to come to the same conclusion. This loss of credibility causes readers to question the government's actions, which teaches them to observe the situation before stepping in blindly.The readers learn, along with Nathan's daughter Leah, that \\"you can't learn anything when pretending to be the smartest person in the room\\" (229). Kingsolver masterfully teaches this lesson by appealing to reason and creating emotional responses that weaken respect for the developmental approaches of religion, politics, and business. These institutions have dictated America's outlook on international development for sixty years. But with respect for the \\"dictator\\" gone, at last readers find the need to look for better answers and methods."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"In her novel, The Poisonwood Bible, Barbara Kingsolver conveys the message that change and hardship stimulate emotional growth. The novel explores the gripping journey of a southern Baptist family of missionaries into the Congolese jungle in the 1950s. The story is told through several perspectives: of the skeptical wife of a Christian zealot preacher and of their four young daughters. Spending several years in a small village and expending unimaginable labor for basic needs like health and safety, they are faced with challenges they never thought they would encounter. The novel is skillfully sprinkled with poignant metaphors, symbols, pathetic fallacies and allusions, all threading together an incredible tale of survival and hope.Being told through the family of a slightly insane religious wreck (the preacher), the book has themes of questioning spirituality and conflict over religious worship. The women of the story, the wife and daughters each have their internal battles, as does the village as a whole. Adah, one of the middle daughters, frequently discusses spelling errors of the different Bible versions and professes that Christianity is wholly a joke. Leah initially accepts Jesus as her savior and works hard to be a \\"good Christian\\". After being in the Congo for a while and exploring different indigenous faiths and after the death of her youngest sister to a snake bite, she loses her fundamentalist edge and becomes more focused on survival and unity of the village, as opposed to converting everyone. The collective village struggles with faith when there is conflict over what to worship. They hold a vote to determine what they should believe in, with hopes to rid the village of a streak of bad luck. Everyone votes out Jesus and the Christian God.The novel continues the theme of choice in a natural disaster when a flood of red ants covers the land destroying all livestock and forcing all inhabitants to flee. It strikes in the middle of the night when the family is awoken to screams and a pulsing, burning sensation, they discover is due to submergence in red ants biting their bodies. Orleanna, the mother/wife of the story, instinctively rescues her youngest daughter who is in bed sick with malaria. She leaves behind Adah, the middle-child cripple, deformed at birth and unable to move quickly enough to save herself. Adah ends up being pulled out of the ants by a neighbor and dragged to safety. Everyone in the family survives the ants and all relationships are strained because they didn't help each other. Rachel, the eldest daughter, is left to fend for herself as well. She discusses her experience with a maturity brought on by the serious nature of the situation. She relates how she survived the red ants to how she survived the Congo altogether: by \\"sticking out your elbows and holding yourself up\\" [p. 517]. Rachel's growth can be traced through the story to where she finally begins to be self-sufficient. This happens more so as a result of necessity rather than choice, when she discovers that growing up, people will not take care of her anymore. The hardships she endures force her to develop an indispensable life skill.Leah struggles through a process of self-discovery and identity in the village. In the beginning, she identifies most with the values of her father and she desperately wants to be accepted by him. She works hard to live up to his standards and after much disappointment by her father's fickle interest and constant criticism, she gives up on him and begins to work on fitting in with the community at large. During a drought with very little food in the village, she hunts with the men causing controversy. Adah compares Leah with her bow and arrow to Hester Prynne with her red \\"A\\", in allusion to The Scarlet Letter. Leah eventually becomes very committed to the Congo and ends up living in several different Congolese areas as an adult, married with children to a man she met in the original village. She grew to be very loyal to her beliefs after much difficulty searching for values as a teen.Adah, Leah's twin, was born with a limp and considered herself \\"slanted\\". She speaks to the reader in riddles and palindromes. She is mute and extremely intelligent. She analyzes such literature as Emily Dickinson, Nathaniel Hawthorne and the bible throughout the novel. Adah basically lives in her own little world and even develops her own language. She calls herself Ada, reinforcing her obsession with symmetry, a result of her crippled body. Adah is convinced in the beginning that she is unwanted and unloved and even that her family intentionally tries to get rid of her and leave her behind. By the end of the story, it is her and no one else that Orleanna brings out of the jungle and back to America. This is where the story climaxes: Adah and Orleanna leave the Congo, Leah marries, and Rachel elopes.Ruth May, the baby of the four sisters, encounters many troubles. She contracts malaria and suffers for a long time. When she finally recovers, she is bitten by a poisonous snake and dies instantly. The snake in this book is an allusion to Eve's serpent in the bible. In both cases, evil is brought into the world and God becomes a punisher. Orleanna feels Ruth May's death must be some sort of punishment from God. She discusses her anguish and acknowledges that her grief will trail her \\"like hair in water\\" for the rest of her life. Although her death was foreshadowed very early on in the book, as Orleanna flashbacked about one of her children's bodies resting in African soil, her death is still horrifying and gripping to the reader.Orleanna recounts her tale as a series of struggles fully conquering her spirit. Her voice is broken until the end of the novel when she decides to make peace with her daughters and Ruth May's memory. Her journey was about finding inner strength and allowing herself to heal.There are several obvious symbols in the book. Firstly, the poisonwood plant is symbolic of several things. Learning the language of the Congolese was very difficult for the family. Saying the word for \\"lord\\" with a slightly different inflection means \\"poisonwood\\". Poisonwood was a weed causing horrible rashes and strangling vast amounts of crops. The preacher tried to incorporate the Congolese language into his sermons and always meant to end them with \\"Jesus is Lord\\", but always said instead \\"Jesus is poisonwood.\\" This was very representative of how the village felt about the religion the family was bringing. The villagers felt the local gods felt disrespected and brought bad luck to the land in the form of disease, drought and death. The poisonwood plant also represents the family falling apart. When they first arrived in the jungle, the father tried to create a garden on their land. It wasn't very long before all their vegetables died and the garden became overgrown with the poisonwood plant. It coincided with the time where the family as a whole began to lose faith about their stay in the village.Another symbol in the book is the okapi. The okapi is an animal that Orleanna sees in the jungle one day and addresses her \\"entries\\", or chapters, to throughout the book. I think this animal is representative of the wild and unpredictable nature of the Congo, constantly bringing an ebb and flow of natural disaster/blessings/lessons. I also find it interesting that Leah, in her controversial hunt with the men, kills an okapi. This is symbolic of her taming of the wild, and coping with the hardships of the Congo by embracing the challenge and taking it down. This thought is further proved by the fact that she was the only one to stay and \\"rough it out\\", as she stays in the Congo throughout her adult life and fights for social justice in a time of political upheaval (another sub-plot of the book.) The okapi haunts Orleanna's thoughts and she receives a small wooden carving of the animal at the end of the book corresponding with the time she makes peace with her tumultuous history and guilt for not leaving the jungle sooner.In Orleanna's words, \\"It's frightening when things you love appear suddenly changed from what you have always known\\" (236). All of the characters of the novel grow and come to terms with the changes in their lives. They cope and learn that no matter how frightening, change helps them to evolve into emotionally stronger people."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I read (and think I reviewed this when it first came out in hardcover). I loved it and the consensus among everyone else I know who has read it has been unanimous. Fascinating characters, nonstop action, great historical setting. Well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisionwood Bible was recommended to me by my mum and I was reluctant to try it because it was so long and I have very little free time in which to read. However, it took me no time to become immersed in this fascinating book. I just could not get enough of the suspense, the adventures, the characters, and the surprises in each chapter. I found myself relating to the characters a bit (especailly Rachel in her younger years). One flaw I saw in the book, though, is that it was bout 100 pages too long. It would have been fine to have stopped when the girls left Africa and if Kingsolver left the rest to the reader's imagination. After the family left Africa I felt that the best of the book was over; I didn't really care about the rest of it, but I read through it. I also felt the separate characters' voices for each chapter was &quot;gimmicky&quot; and a little hard to believe-- each character being defined as &quot;just so&quot; with their personality and manner of speech. I loved to hear Leah talk; Kingsolver really has a way with similies and metaphors. This book was wonderful and I spent all of my free time-- on the bus, during study hall, at breakfast-- reading this book. It really was a beautiful read and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book moved me. I hadn't expected to love it as much as I did -- I must agree with the reviewer who said they can't stop thinking or talking about it and are recommending it to everyone they know so they can discuss it.I read this in three days. Right from the first page, I couldn't put it down...and even though I agree that the ending wasn't quite as powerful or gripping as the beginning, it is still easily one of the best books I've read.Kingsolver kept me entranced with her prose and the vivid characters she drew for me. I don't think the novel suffered for its lack of a similar &quot;voice&quot; for Nathan. I think we're meant to know him only through the eyes of these women, as we see all the other happenings around them. I loved each voice in a different way: Ruth May's innocence and precocity; Leah's fierce righteousness; Adah's marvellous facility with language; Rachel's silly malapropisms (I didn't find them excessive at all!); Orleanna's quiet resignation.The story and characters kept me up late into the night even after I put the book down and I still think of it often.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I waited a while before I read this book, because I thought it might not be as personal and character-driven as Kingsolver's other novels and short stories. However, I was in for a happy surprise when I did read it. Kingsolver writes a meticulously researched account of Congo history and creates a number of believable and compelling characters as well. I liked how she told the novel from multiple perspectives; she switched points of view frequently but not in a disorienting way. This approach provides the reader with a number of different voices to listen to, and presents a fuller picture of conditions in the Congo and in the Price family. The only problem with the book is its length, but the bulk of the book is really a blessing in disguise. By the time you finish, you'll have the feeling that Kingsolver has written a great epic and left no (or few) stones unturned in her account. Many readers may disagree with her politics, but the book is still educational, insightful and beautifully written."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The characters in Poisonwood Bible are confronted with two essential questions: &quot;Why are we here? What then must we do?&quot; If you're a careful reader, by the book's end you'll not only know how you would answer, you'll understand why others choose to answer as they do. A great book, moral to its core, Tolstoyian."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"this is the crowning achievement of barbara kingsolver, obviously a labor of love, and so rich it is to be savored as slowly as the fluid style allows. historically accurate, with a true inside view of events that are not fully reported on in this country, masterfully developed characters that are obviously related, yet incredibly unique. this book is one of my top three...i don't lend it out, i buy copies for friends."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The character development was magnificent and the story told by each of the daughters with their different perspectives was fascinating. I actually didn't want it to end it was such a pleasure to read. Delicious and thought provoking."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The book was a fasciniting insight into the conflict between the arrogance of the westerner who always knows best and the indiginous population who actually do know what they are doing. The conflict between the two was clearly outlined. This was relected in the internal conflict present within the family structure. The use of the females family members to narrate the story gave it a slant which would not have been possible if the father had been narrating. It could even be said that the males are for the most part described in less than flattering terms. I noticed that the official reviewer found the 'malapropisms' of one daughter annoying. On the contrary, I found that if you think about the word mistakenly used in context with its surrounding thoughts, that quite often one could see a meaning just as relevant yet totally different from the surface meaning. Please look again!All in all, this was one of the most riveting books I have read in a long time."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book is so beautifully written, I enjoyed savoring each word. Kingsolver weaves an amazing story, and the way the whole tale is told, from the point of view, separately, of each of the women, makes this read all the more wonderful. It allows you to know many different, beloved characters, and get a different p.o.v. per chapter. I have not read a book this good in a long, long time. What a pleasure."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver outdoes herself in this powerful story of a tyrannical Baptist missionary who never fails to say and do the wrong thing in his quest to convert the Congolese natives.Kingsolver employs a masterful narrative style through the voices of the missionary's wife and four daughters. As each woman narrates a chapter, in turn, five distinct voices and perspectives begin to emerge. Layer upon layer, the events and emotions of their years in the Congo unfold. I laughed and cried with and for these characters.This novel is a must read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"It's simple: this book is for those who like to think. If you just want a simple read then don't read it. All in all, this book is very well-written. Kingsolver covers what she believes without saying it outright, contrary to &quot;One Woman's Review&quot; from St. Louis. She does not get &quot;too preachy.&quot; Her thoughts are just displayed outright, which gets you to think about what you actually believe."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is a superb book, and a must read if you want to understand the mind of Africa.What struck me most about this book is the insight it gives into the development of Africa. The details are almost an aside, a flicker in the plot, but by the time I had finished I understood far more the terrible rage that burns in this land. Barbara Kingsolver handles it with great sensitivity, but she does not hide the role that the West has had in creating (and washing its hands of) Central Africa."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book combines some of the best writing I've ever seen with an emotional story and a great deal of enlightenment. Never have I enjoyed and learned so much from a single book. This is by far the best book I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"In short: The Poisonwood Bible is astounding. After I read through the first 15 pages (which, albeit, was a bit confusing), I could not put the book down. For anybody who grew up in the 50s, or who has an interest in learning about life in the Congo and Africa, or who simply loves sitting down to a gripping novel, this is for you. A masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I simply cannot rave about this book enough for you people. It is beyond words how great the book is. Even though the first section is slow, by the end you will be blown away. It is a powerfully moving, eye-opening piece of literature. I have personally read this book three times and each time, new ideas and questions are revealed to me. I have found that each person has a new perspective on the book, and has favorite characters and characters that they do not like so much. The characters that I believe no person could stand are loved by my friends, while my favorite character, Adah is deplored by others.A truly great book and a fantastic addition to any library."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I seldom read novels, much preferring fact to fiction, but this book is wonderful. It is related of course to real life and tells the story of how an American family try to adapt their lives to living in a village in Congo with their bible-thrashing father.Each of the 4 daughters and the mother relate their own story throughout the book and it is possible to feel akin to each of them as they bring the reader into their lives and the difficulties that each of them encounters.Struggles, sadness and difficulties are all a part of the story but it is possible to sympathise with each member of the family, even the father, as they go about their daily lives in the remoteness of an African village.I loved this book and couldn't put it down. There is much to reflect on and learn about life and (having lived overseas myself in developing countries) oh so true!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I think I just found myself a new favorite author in Barbara Kingsolver. Ms. Kingsolver is such a talented writer with an uncanny ability to use well-crafted and entertaining fiction to reveal a fascinating period of history - the political development of the African Congo. Not only was this an intelligent history lesson and a study of Western ethnocentrism, it was also a tale of family bonds, cultural adaptation/tolerance, and forgiveness.The writing style alone was intriguing. This story was written as a Biblical parable, and includes the Books of &quot;Genesis&quot;,&quot;the Revelation&quot;, &quot;The Judges&quot;, &quot;Bel and the Serpent&quot;, &quot;Exodus&quot; and &quot;Song of Three Children&quot;. But this is not the Bible as we know it - &quot;Genesis&quot;, for instance, represents the beginning of the Price Family's African experience. Nathan Price was an evangelical Southern Baptist preacher who leads his wife and 4 daughters to Africa to spread Christianity to the natives in the Belgian Congo in the 1950s. While his faith blinded him to the cultural differences and political realities that surrounded him, we are told the Price family's story by Orleanna, Rachel, Leah, Adah and little Ruth May Price. Each segment is told in the first-person and each character has her own voice - what amazed me was how real these women were!The history of the Congo and Africa as a whole was fascinating and I guess what amazed me most is how the policies of our own government toward other nations in which there are serious economic interests have not changed that much since the 1950s. Ms. Kingsolver discussed how American interest in the mineral resources (diamonds, copper, cobalt) of the Congo led to American involvement in the Independence movement there. ...Not unlike the relationship between oil and Middle Eastern entanglements! Very timely reading!If this book is indicative of all Ms. Kingsolver's writing, I can't wait to read more!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is one of the best books I have ever read! It chronicles the journey of the Price family as they travel to the Belgian Congo as missionaries. Although the book is over 500 pages long, the story is so captivating that the length is not an obstacle to enjoyment of the novel. This book is not only a provocative story, but also inspires the reader to reflect upon his or her own questions regarding faith. I absolutely loved this book and now consider it to be one of my favorites."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible, written by Barbara Kingsolver, embraces the imperialism present in the Belgian Congo in the 1960's and beyond. The novel is based around the missionary experience of the Price family in the Belgian Congo. Rather than use conventional chapters, Kingsolver writes each new chapter in the perspective of either one of the four Price daughters or Orleanna, their mother. Each daughter shares her experiences from completely different points of view, which enables the reader to relate to each individual character more and more as both the plot and the characters develop.Each aspect of the American dream, as well as lifestyle, is completely distorted when the Prices attempt to integrate it into the African society. They go from outcast missionaries to practically natives of the land in the amount of time (around thirty years) covered in the book. The lives of the daughters are traced from adolescence to adulthood, and as each of their personalities develops, the reader is able to feel proud when they accomplish something, sad when someone or something is lost, and an overall familiarity with the characters that few other novels can offer.The Poisonwood Bible has earned its place as one of my favorite books. Although I sometimes found it difficult to agree with all of the information, the ideas and issues are thought-provoking and intuitive. Barbara Kingsolver's novel truly depicts the trials and tribulations of missionaries, their struggle to adapt to the African lifestyle, and the impact it has on their futures. Universal themes and controversial issues make this book a must-read for anyone willing to open their mind to it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Five Women in the Congo Living Together to survive Five Voices, One StoryThe Poison Wood Bible is a novel about a family from Georgia who went to the Congo to live for a year. Nathan Price, the father and a Baptist preacher, took his family to the Congo so he could reform the sinners. His actions determine the choices of the mother and her four daughters, and the novel is about the women. Barbara Kingsolver does an excellent job of letting the reader get to know the four daughters in the book. She also gives the reader a great view of how beautiful and dangerous the Congo is. The only thing that bothers me about the novel is that from page 389 all the way to about 533 the book started to be more about political problems instead of being about the women.The oldest daughter, Rachel, is a spoiled, self-centered child of sixteen. Her main concern throughout the book is how everything affects her and how she is above the Africans. &#65533;We aren&#65533;t all that accustomed to the African race to begin with, since back home they keep to their own parts of town&#65533; she says; &#65533;I didn&#65533;t see there was any need for them to be so African about it.&#65533; (p. 45)Then there are the twins, Leah and Adah, who are highly intelligent and down-to-earth children. Leah is excited and intrigued about her new surroundings. She learns as much as possible about the people and learns how to hunt with a bow and arrow. In her eyes this is a positive step to help her family survive, but in the eyes of the men in the village she is a girl and has no business doing the jobs of men. But Leah is determined to hunt with the men. She tells her father, &#65533;I&#65533;m going with the men and that&#65533;s final.&#65533; (p. 340) Adah, on the other hand, had been deprived of air in her mother&#65533;s womb and was unable to use one side of her body. She grows up believing that she was the one left behind. She always feels unneeded and thinks she is a burden to the others in the family. She says, &#65533;I should have been devoured in my bed, for all I seem to be worth,&#65533; and &#65533;In one moment alive, and in the next left behind.&#65533; (p. 305)Ruth May is the youngest and is the apple of her mother&#65533;s eye. She gives us a sweet, innocent, child like view of her experience in the Congo. &#65533;I thought they were all fat, but father said no. They&#65533;re hungry as can be, and don&#65533;t get their vitamins. And still God makes them look fat. I reckon that&#65533;s what they get for being the Tribes of Ham.&#65533; (p. 50) In addition to all the different personalities and ages of the girls the author gives a magnificent view of the Congo: &#65533;Sunrise Tantalize, Evil eyes hypnotize: that is the morning, Congo pink. Any morning, every morning. Blossomy rose-color birdsong air streaked sour with breakfast cookfires.&#65533;(p. 30)This is how I saw the Congo after I finished reading the book. The Congo is a place of beauty where people still live together to survive. The people of the village work together to have food for their children, and if one of them receives a blessing of too much, they share what they have. But it is also a very dangerous place. The people in the village have their own beliefs and laws. When the Price family steps on these laws they pay a dear price. Leah says, &#65533; Ruth May, honey, it&#65533;s all right,&#65533; I said. &#65533;The bad snake is gone.&#65533; The witch doctor puts a snake in the hen house because the Price family has gone against the laws he feels are important and needed for the people of the village to survive. The Price family just did not understand that these people had a strong belief system that they were willing to protect.When the women separate to survive, the novel starts to get more political, and that bothered me. It made me feel that the author changed directions on me. I continued to want to know about the girls. But over all I thought the book was a must read. It is well written and gives me a sense of being there."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I recently read The Poisonwood Bible by Barbara Kingsolver, and I thought it was fantastic! It is about Nathan Price, a Baptist missionary who decides to go to Africa and convert people of the Congo. He, his wife Orleanna, and his four daughters, Rachel, Leah, Adah, and Ruth May, leave for the Congo in 1959 with only their most important belongings. Life in the Congo is not easy, and Nathan Price is making it worse for the five Price women. He has develpoed a fanatical need to convert the Congolese people, something they are not interested in. After several horrifying events, the Price women decide that they have to get out of Africa - and away from their father.The book is told in the views of the five female Prices. Orleanna, the mother, narrates the first chapter of each section, and the four daughters narrate the chapters in between. I like the fact that you get different views of a different situation, because it shows the major contrast between the characters.I also liked how each experiences the Prices went through were unexpected. Living in Arizona, one does not usually see elephants or green mamba snakes. I learned very much about Africa, just from reading about all the different wildlife and also the style of living.I think that the moral of the story is: When desperate, human beings will go to the extreme. This moral helps to explain the story in some parts, mainly towards the end of the book.I hope you enjoy this book as much as I have!~Sarah Hofstadter"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I learned about this book through my English teacher, and it seemed interesting; the idea of an American family going to live in the Congo looked like something I could enjoy. It turned out to have a very different perspective than I imagined.The story starts out with the Price family leaving their home in the American South to go to the Congo. The father, Nathan, is a preacher and is going there as a missionary. The story is never told from his point of view. However, the mother occasionally tells the story, revealing events in the past. The majority of the story, the events that occur in the Congo, are told by the four children. The oldest, Rachel, is about 15 years old and absolutely despises the Congo, sincerely wishing to be back in the United States. The youngest, Ruth May, is maybe 7 years old, and gets along best with the natives, even teaching some children to play \\"Mother May I,\\" despite the fact that none of those children share a common language with her. In between are twins, Leah and Adah, both eleven. Adah is unable to use one side of her body, and does not talk except in emergencies. Leah follows her father around and explores the area more than any others. As a result, she eventually learns the local language (though late in the book).The part that I did not expect was the religious aspect of the story. The Price family is religious, and this plays a part in the book. The father spends his time preaching and trying to convince the locals to be baptized, and meets some resistance, partially due to bad translation, and partially due to the fact that Africa is fundamentally different from America. Also, it turns out that many of the things that the family wants to do -- like keeping an owl as a pet -- are for some reason bad luck or not allowed by the tribe's social customs (the owl was considered evil by the villagers, for example). The subtle conflict between two religions makes the book memorable.The end result is an exciting story that pleasantly surprised me and had an interesting (if long) ending that left everything pretty much wrapped up."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is my absolute most favorite book! I've read it countless times, and given copies to many of my friends.Written beautifully from 5 different points of view, the story comes to life with twists and turns that leave me laughing, crying, or totally shocked!I've traveled to Africa 4 times, and her vivid descriptions of the Congo's jungle made me pause in rememberance.Ms. Kingsolver, we want MORE! :)"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Book was great and the the READER on the CD was Very GOOD. I got a whole new insight as well as a good read!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"After reading this book, I feel like I myself have lived in the Congo. Some parts were annoying/slow (especially the chapters narrated by Adah in the beginning), but it's worth reading the entire thing just to get the experience of raw Africa. It's been over 6 months since I've read the book, but I still think about it from time to time and look at the comforts & conveniences around me in appreciation.This is NOT a pro-religion, evangelistical novel, so don't get turned off by that aspect of the plot. Read it for the extremely trying experience of living, nay, surviving in Africa."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I love this story. I think Kingsolver did and amazing job of writing the book in 5 different voices. I thought it was really interesting- I learned a lot about the history of Africa. I think that the author paints a vivid picture of the area- I could picture the people and the places while I was reading. Occasionally the narration seems to get a little long-winded, but overall I really enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I recall that the first half of the book was hard to read - a bit slow and hard to push through the different voices. But I can only vaguely recall this after completing the second half rather quickly. This is one of those books that should change your perspective - everything is a few inches sideways from here on out. I find myself listening differently, reading words other than the ones my neighbor might see, and intuiting issues and needs in a new way. I thought I was pretty \\"aware\\" before I read this book, but the long build, and the strong, personal, matter-of-fact discussion was wonderful."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I've enjoyed her other novels, always thick with nature & the natural world. I've been resistant to reading the Poisonwood Bible because it was an Oprah Book Club Book. (I usually find them banal) Kingsolver uses several characters to (all of which you can probably find within yourself) depict the hardships of the people of Africa & the political goings on the East is so unaware of. When a book influences my ideals in anyway or gives me a perspective I didn't previously have I consider it a good book. That's what Kingsolver did for me in this novel."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Set in the Congo, this book spans the politically turbulent decades that followed independence from Belgium. A Baptist preacher, trying to atone for his past, drags his family into the jungles of Congo to preach Christianity to the poorest. The impact of living in such alien circumstances, among such poverty, will shape the rest of his family's lives. The story unfolds in alternating narratives from the daughters, with periodic flashback narratives from the wife. This book paints a vivid picture of the cultures and political turmoil of the period, and draws the reader ever deeper into Africa. Each of the characters has her own flaws, and while some are easier to empathize with than others, none are perfect, and the narratives help make the reader a silent member of the family.There are so many themes in the book, discussing them all could form the basis for an entire course of study. There certainly is a cautionary note about the dangers of trying to impose solutions without understanding the local conditions (a relevant point today in other parts of the world). The author also explores the impact of centuries of foreign involvement on the ongoing political strife in this unfortunate nation. There is much to think about in this book, which is well written and generally pleasant to read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I remember when Poisonwood got powerful reviews and I didn't think I was sophisicated enough to read such a book. I was a novice reader and skimming through the first few pages scared the wits out of me. Years later, I finally read the book and it is indeed a highly mature novel. Most books take a few chapters before I am entyced, but Poisonwood took well over half the book! While I usually get into countless hours of reading and can often finish a book in a few days, I found myself putting the book aside after each chapter and not quite excited enough to keep the dust off the cover. But if you bought this book and find yourself in a similar feeling, do keep reading because it somehow does a complete turn.It is the story of a Baptist minister and his family's missionary voyage to a Congo village - being told by five narrators: his wife and fours daughters. Each narrator takes such different views and tones that although Kingsolver provides an introduction each time, it is entirely unneccessary. Through their story telling, they each take on such strong individual characteristics that you wonder if Kingsolver went through a multi-personality phase while writing this book. Even as decades and life changing events pass, you follow the evolution of each family member but can still identify their everlasting roots. From the comical innocence of Ruth May, to the deep dark twisted sarcasm of Adah, with a balance of simple self indulged wits of Rachel and the complex truth seeking Leah - it is only right to top off with a powerful Southern mother who relies on her instinct and maternal will to survive the Congo in spite of her obsessed and imminent insanity of her minister husband. This balance is much needed as some characters are so intense while others lack the oomph to last an entire novel.This book will have you question its factual possibilities and can easily be mistaken as a memoir or collection of confessions. It will make you want to learn more about the Congo and its pre-indendepent natives. You will feel a whirl of emotions - anger, guilt, fear, hope - to finally, contentment.1 out of every 10 paragraphs are pointless and boring, but the other 9 are so capturing that you resolve Kingsolver's intent is a delicate balance."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I bought this book when I was about 14 years old. I'm a book-worm and usually almost inhale literature. For example I finished The Life of Pi in 8 hours. But with this book it's been 5 years and I've never been able to finish it. I've picked it up many times and though the story seems interesting it's difficult to get into the world Kingsolver has created. I find myself putting it down and finding something else after only a few pages.This has nothing to do with her writing style or the storyline. Just a warning to those of you who prefer more action, fun, or fast paced books. Or younger people like myself, it's probably not something you want to buy.I'm going to keep it on my shelf for a few more years and give it another try. Maybe I'll be able to read it when I'm older?"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I must say this book is simply amazing. Barbara Kingsolver has really outdone herself. Nathan Price, the overzealous baptist on a mission to the Congo, dragging his family along. The plot thickens as Nathan tries to bring Christianity around to the Congolese. Leah, wanting to be just like her father, slowly loses faith and begins to rebel. After a year of being in the Congo, Nathan will not allow them to leave. Ruth May falls ill and dies from a snake bite. Leah focuses on her crush Anatole, whom she later marries. Rachel and Adah also become successful. The characters change and mature over time. It's a great book and entertaining to see the growth and change in opinions. The book has you going from beginning to end."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Although I felt the book was well written overall it could not keep my attention. The book spouted off too much religous jargen and I cannot say I enjoyed the ending. As a matter of fact I had to force myself to read the ending."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"One of the greatest things about this novel is the author's use of perspective. Each of the four Price daughters take turns telling the story. Orlenna (the mother) also opens each book. Barbara Kingsolver does a wonderful job of establishing the 'voice' of each character.The story however, is very depressing. I kept waiting for it to take a slightly positive turn, but it never did. The only character I ended up liking at the end was Leah. And I even felt pretty lukewarm about her.The thing that disturbed me the most about this book was the author's tendancy to equate Christianity with Americanism and missionary work with imperialism. I admit that Nathan Price's brand of Christianity had little to do with service or love. He cared nothing for the physical troubles of the people of the Congo. All he wanted to do was dunk them in the river. Brother Fowls went to the other extreme and seemed to care very little about the spiritual well being of the people around and tended to concentrate on the here and now. Not that he is a bad character--he truly loved the people of Africa. I just believe that neither Nathan Price or Brother Fowls is an accurate picture of a true missionary.Is this book worth reading? Yes. But I believe it needs to be taken with a grain of salt. It does raise some important issues but I do not believe Ms. Kingsolver fully addresses each of them."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This was a very good reading. I can strongly recommend to anyone who has any desire to deeply think about life. This book is addressing the issue of the fact that neither good nor bad are absolute categories.Also, a good starting point to think about overusing natural resources in modern societies knowing that one day we'll be out of them..."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I must admit that when this book was choosen for my book club, I was more interested in the debate the book would cause, living in a conservative babtist driven area of the world, than actually reading the book. Forcing myself to keep going, I began to realize that it really didn't have anything to do with religion. To me, this book was a channel for the author's political opinion and memory scrapbook of the scenes of Africa, intermixed with four daughter's challenge to survive their parents. The four daughters are a riot- the best parts of the book focused on their individual growth and survival, being born in America and raised in the Congo. The weakness of the book was all the in depth information on Africa or the political upheavel. At times, I would re-read the page or chapter, thinking I had missed something. This is definetly a book that caputures Africa during a significant time in History, but I wouldn't recommend it- I can bet that everyone who reads it will go away with a different meaning."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book is definitley one everyone should read once a lifetime. It is beutiful, witty and deep yet surprisingly easy to read!I thought this book would be one of the more challenging I have read, and I put off reading it for a few months after I got it- but I wished I hadn't. The story was unbelievably touching, the character devolpment extraordinary and zealous- How much I wanted to reach out and just spend ONE DAY with these girls. Kinglsover is a genius writer and I can't read to read the next one of her books on my list. The theme, timeless and tireless- was the backbone of such a spectacular work of literary art. I am sure that future generations will look back on this as a masterpiece of our time and being read in Highscool English Classes."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is one of the best books I've read in years. The story is absorbing and teaches the reader a lot about tribal life in the Congo, circa 1960. The father in the book is a rigid, self-righteous missionary who shows as much disdain for his wife and daughters as he does for the Congolese people. The author did an excellent job of writing the story from the viewpoint of the women, while keeping each woman's personality distinct. (The father is not one of the narrators; but this seems fitting since he does not allow his wife and daughters the opportunity to vocalize their own opinions.)The only reason I gave this book four stars, instead of five, is because of the heavy-handed preachy, political tone the narration takes near the end. I would expect some of the characters to become political when thrust into the situation they endured. However, one of the preacher's daughters, who is most respectful of the Congolese, becomes so ashamed of her race that she wishes she weren't white. Here, I think Kingsolver went too far. Why not allow this poor creature to see that people of all colors are part of God's plan, that no person -- white, black, or otherwise -- is inherently bad for being born a certain color -- least of all this woman?"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book is quite boring. The story is toooo slow... you can practicall fall asleep, plus the characters are not very likable. I found it very hard to identify with any of them. There have been very few ocassions when I have found myself skipping pages of a book in order to finish it but this was definitely one of them."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I really, really enjoyed this book. The characters were interesting, and the multiple points of view kept things moving. The latter portion, after they leave the mission, seemed choppy and heavily didactic. I can't help but think that the author could have streamlined this portion of the book. And Rachel could have done with a few less malapropisms. Sure, a limited number fit with her character, but the device was definitely overused. Overall, though, I thought this was a wonderful book, and I want to re-read it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I have two friends, who are not well-acquainted with each other, and who both spent a year in Africa. Both of them have told me, at different times, that they wanted to write about what it was like to go to Africa to return to the United States and then try to sort out what their experiences had actually meant to them. When they each read The Poisonwood Bible, both commented to me that they probably did not need to write that book themselves, since Barbara Kinsolver had written it for them. I think that is a very important endorsement of this book.I have not been to Africa, but it has become one of the personal &quot;filters&quot; that I use when I think of Africa, recent African history, and evangelical Christianity, all of which are major topics in this novel. It is very different than Kingsolver's earlier novels, and it has places where it drags or is repetitive, but I think it is an excellent, thought-provoking book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible held me in rapt attention for days. Five voices tell the story in different, and equally important ways. I don't know of another book that tells a story so strongly throught the eyes of a cast of women. It was interesting, foreign, new, exciting, and significant. Additionally, Kingsolver is a master of language. I must add that the political portions of the book toward the end were a bit in the grandstand-ish vein, and maybe more toward the side of a judgement on western culture than part of the story. Still 100% worth the time to read. Emotional and important."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Well articulated, deep, and paced. Ms. Kingslover has a knack for words that you rarely see in mordern writers.You can imaging the sights, the smells, the heat and the pain that each of these characters feel all throughout the unraveling of the family.Everything about this book is likely to make you forget which continent you are still on when you are reading it. You get as easily in the head of a mother of four daughters dealing with her over-zealous husband as much as you can follow the thought pattern of her 6 year old child and the palandrome thinking of her quietest twin.The characters are fully developed, (think of it as along the lines of Mosquito Coast, but better written, more intense and easier to follow and sympathize with), and the plot is amazingly realistic for fiction.It would be easy to imagine classrooms of the future (as it is already) using this book in their English classes to show how beautiful the written language can be, as well as provoke thought and discussion, plus give those with fully developed imaginations a sense of a country that they might not have visited yet."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I was assigned this book for summer reading, and I was expecting it to be typical Oprah book material. I was pleasantly surprised. There is a lot of hidden cynical thoughts, and some sassy comments. This book was a delight to read, and kept me turning the pages. It can be a nice story, or if you want to look deeper, it can be a book with a lot of umph to it. There is a lot of symbolism. The story is about a semi-mad missionary who drags his wife and four daughters into the Congo with him, during Independence. Kingsolver follows not only the Congo's transformation but also those of the mother and daughters. Brilliantly written, the author can switch characters with such skill. This piece of work is written in a very believable, likeable style. You will be drawn into their struggle."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I LOVED this book! From the first page I was hooked. I loved the way the story unfolded from all the different sisters point of view,and the mothers. I loved what I learned about Africa and the Congo. I felt every joy and sadness as if I was a part of it, and the loss was almost unbearable. I can't say enough about this wonderful story, or these characters, it stayed with me long after the last page. Debbi"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I have read most of Barbarba's earlier books, and found them funny and loving. I picked up this book, out of couriousity and started on the winding emotional and historical journey of the Piosonwood Bible. Wonderfully written, albeit somewhat different form her earlier works, but no less touching. She opens the readers eyes to a different world, where you will question the Industrialized nations' commerical,obsession with &quot;things&quot;. The characters are amazing...heroic...weak...human. Do yourself a favor pick this up today."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I was reluctant to buy this book, given that it strayed so far from her stories situated in the Southwest that I've loved so much. After hearing from friends for the past few years how wonderful it was, I finally picked it up -- and have been truly rewarded!It's an amazing book -- one of the rare books that creates a real dilema when you are nearly through with it: &quot;What am I going to do when I finish this book?&quot;If you are discouraged from reading this book by the thought that this is just another of the &quot;Americans-go-to-Africa...&quot; genre, set that thought aside and prepare for a whirlwind of a journey. Kingsolver delights the reader with her poetic, playful and truly witty prose, and her accute sense of observation of human nature."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I stumbled over the &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; almost by accident while backpacking around Latin America. (Truth is, &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; was the only book the 2nd hand bookstore would let me swap my old book \\"I know this much is true\\" for, without charging anything extra. On a backpackers budget and running low on money, this was a good argument for choosing a book *smile*).At first I thought, \\"There is no way I am getting through this 600 pages book\\"!! It seemed incredibly boring. Honestly, I feared the book would last for the rest of my trip! However, after struggling through about 150 pages or so I really got into it and after that I found it hard, if not impossible, to put down. (I actually read while I was having dinner at a restaurant with my boyfriend!)I found myself to enjoy both the story of the characters (a missionary, his wife, and their daughters) as well as the political history lesson I got about the Belgian Congo. &quot;The Poisonwood Bible\\" gave me a better understanding of the politics of Africa and the difficulties of its people. I learned heaps about a lifestyle very different from mine, despite the fact that the story was built on fictional people.If you can be patient and give the book some time, you will find that you enjoy \\"The Poisonwood bible\\"."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is a wonderful piece of literature. The caharcter development is excellent. I love a book that can transport you to a different time and place."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible was my first foray into the world of Barbara Kingsolver. I bought the book many moons ago, long before Oprah graced it with her ubiquitous sticker, and I started it twice without getting further than the first few chapters. I've talked to other readers since then, and the general consensus seems to be that the novel is indeed hard to begin. I did read it in its entirety on my third try, and am glad that I did. The story of the 4 daughters and mother who had Africa forced upon them by a missionary zealot father was a very interesting read, and I learned quite a bit about the political history of the Congo. The book is long, however, and the characters quite complex. It's definitely one that you'll keep turning over in your mind after completing it. The novel is written in chapters that are narrated by the five females in the family, and each of them has a very distinct voice, a tribute to Kingsolver's writing abilities. On the down note, I and many others in a book discussion I attended seemed to find Kingsolver a bit preachy in the later half of the book. The first half is definitely the highlight, when the girls are young and they live in the tiny village where their father, severely damaged by WWII, attempts to convert the inhabitants into Southern Baptists. Overall, the book is somewhat of a challenge to read, but rewarding. A recommendation, especially if you have someone to discuss it with after you've finished."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This enchanting tale of a struggle of a Baptist family in the jungle of the Congo both entertains and educates. It includes the story of president- elect Lumumba being assasinated and Mobutu taking over and instilling his self indulgent beliefs. This mixture of both history and entertainment allows this book to be a true classic."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"A solid book. To me one of the most interesting parts of the book were the political chaos scenes depicting the history of the Belgian Congo. I knew little of modern Central Afican history, this presented a clear picture of U.S. foriegn involement in preventing communism, African culture, the end of the colonialist era, and the emotions of the Congolese in that turbulent time.Kingsolver did her research. If you are interested in the Congo or books about imprisonment, I'd read this over &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; any day."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I began this book several times before I actually mustered up the time and energy needed to get through the first couple of &quot;daughter&quot; chapters. Now that i've finished the book, am thankful. The book is great! Character development of the sisters, each a different story, Orleanna the mother and Nathan the crazed Baptist preacher father who puts The Word of Jesus before his own family time and again sends a message to all Christians. Yes, one of the daughters says...&quot;there are Christians, and there are Christians&quot; Kingsolver weaves the landscape of powerful Africa throughout, giving comfortable Americans the opportunity to consider just how lucky, spoiled, wasteful and short-sighted we truly are! The many messages sent out might be missed and the book enjoyable nevertheless, but &quot;hearing&quot; each characters message truly is a contemplative journey. Can't wait for the movie!Karola~"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"You know you've read a great book when you hate to leave the characters behind at the end, and that was precisely the case for me with The Poisonwood Bible (though Rachel was getting a little wearing...).I'm admittedly not at all a history buff, so the historical setting and references to real occurrences were interesting and (embarrassingly) new to me. They do openly reflect the author's political leanings, but still help build a historical context that adds to the story.I still love Adah, as much as her sections would slow me down with the writing ... but also with the deep truths in her observations.Excellent writing, engaging characters and a peek into another world combine to make this one of my favorite books of the year. Thank you, Barbara Kingsolver, for giving me entertaining AND intelligent summer reading."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book is about a missionary family in the Belgian Congo in the 1960s. It's told in the voices of the four daughters of the family, and follows them for many years, even after they've left (escaped from?) the Congo. The story of the family is in itself very good, the book is also about the tragically turbulent social and political post-colonial history of the Congo, the interference of the old colonizers, the mismanaged elections, the murder of Patrice Lumumba, the tyranny and megalomania of Mobotu, the tragic underdevelopment of a country with so much potential. Yes, the book is message-y, and Kingsolver's personal views on the situation in the Congo are clear, but that is part of what kept me so deeply engrossed me in the novel. Without that, I don't think that it wouldn't have been the wonderful piece of work that it is."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I found this book hard to get into at first, and needed to go back and re-read to get the feel for each of the characters who tell this story. But once it got going, I couldn't put it down - and it is a big book to get through in one sitting!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is an excellent book. A stunning achievement of character development, plot, theme, description &amp; all things related to writing &amp; fiction. It is a huge book, but the long read is something to savor ... I was actually sad when the book ended. I completely disagree with reviewers who said the second half seemed slower than the first half (What can I say? Perhaps those readers were anxious to get to bed?) or that the character of Rachel isn't as strong as the others. Rachel is the least likeable character, by design; not a flaw of the writer but a flawed narrator (Come on, folks, that's the point!) And the characters age in this book, so the slightly changed perspectives of the characters in the second half are appropriate and revealing. This is an exceptional book, one you definitely want to own rather than check out from the library, as you'll want to read it again and again."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"And at what price? These are some of the questions raised as a fiery Baptist preacher drives his family to the ground in his valiant (in his mind) attempt to convert the people of Congo to the ways and love of Christ. As told by the four women of his family -- wife Orleanna, oldest daughter Rachel, twins Leah and Adah, and youngest Ruth May -- the book chronicles their lives as a missionary family in Congo, amidst the political upheavals that shaped the continent politically and socially, and even tragically.Nathan the preacher, behind the take-no-prisoners style of mission, is actually a frail man. Tormented by his war past, he is driven to settle the score between cowardice and bravery. Behind the wall, he is unable to even provide basic foods and needs for his family -- a &quot;higher calling,&quot; as one of his daughters states. His tyranny is unbearable to his family, until one day, with just the clothes on their backs, the women escape from the clutches of Nathan the husband and father, Nathan the preacher man whom the village regarded as dangerous.Rachel never wanted to come to Africa, Leah strived to be father's favorite, Adah was crippled from birth and had a twisted, but sensible, view on life, and Ruth May was like the little mongoose. The narration, from each women, are multidimensional, although I thought sometimes Kingsoler's political agenda got in the way through Leah's narrations. Yet their lives are intertwined like vines with Africa. As their fortunes (so to speak) change, as they age, their lives always revolve around the continent they hated.The book is full of foreshadowing. From the moment they step off the plane in Congo, the night when the army ants attack, to the entire village fighting over the game hunted in desperation -- desperate need of sustenance as the drought dried everything left to eat -- I couldn't help feeling dread as the family, and the entire village, slowly disintegrated.As an atheist, I asked myself, what would be proper in God's eyes? Answering the call of higher being and neglecting and abusing -- the inability to provide -- your own family? Or should the basic needs of family should be met in balance? Perhaps in Nathan's eyes, what he did was in balance, or that there never could be such a thing when God's calling is involved. Even as a former Christian, it's a question that I, nor anyone in church could really answer. I always believed salvation starts from within. Within one's self, withing one's family. If Nathan's own family despised him, and ultimately rejects God (which he wouldn't have known, but for the sake of the argument...) how could he have expected to bring salvation to strangers?If I have to find a fault in this book, it's the lack of dimension with Nathan. I wished for his own perspective, not tainted perspectives from his family. It's the lack of understanding I felt, perhaps the entire family felt, that left me a little frustrated, and yet a little sympathetic for Nathan. Each of the women close their chapters with Nathan a little differently, and each of them remind us, one must save himself in order to save others."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"In 1959, a Baptist minister takes his wife and 4 daughters to the Belgian Congo to preach the word of God. Ignoring the advice he is given, he stays on even as the country begins to fall apart, with disastrous consequences for all. With the big picture of history going on around them, the family is inexorably drawn downwards in a spiral of disaster. We continue on with those who leave the Congo, learning that such a place can be left, but will never leave you.The book is written with various characters taking turns as the narrator - the mother Orleanna, and the daughters - self-absorbed Rachael, crippled Adah, strong-willed Leah and the baby, Ruth May. It is through their very personal viewpoints that we see their little part of the world as part of a larger picture - the Independence of the Congo. What is so wonderful about this book is that Kingsolver manages to make you interested in the viewpoint of all of the sisters, and it is through their multiple narratives that you build your impression of the story. Kingsolver also takes the bold step of continuing the story after the family has left the Congo, and we see how the personal traits of the sisters continue into their adult lives. (Rachael comes across as a parody, but trust me - i have met women like that in very similar circumstances!)The first 2/3 of the book reminded me a lot of The Mosquito Coast - a family dragged into the wilderness by the father, and kept there through his arrogance, pride and self-superior stupidity. It is quite a damning indictment of misplaced belief in the superiority of Western Culture, but not, i think, in a ram-it-down-your-throat politically correct way. It is a story not only about displacement, or about Africa. It is a well-constructed story about families, perceptions and how character is only partly formed by environment. While it is a hefty tome (614 small-print pages) i was never once bored or tempted to skim pages. A book i would recommend to anyone who is interested in a good read set in an interesting environment."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I read so many books that I now keep a list of titles because I actually forget which ones I have read. I will never forget this book or the characters in it. It is such a profound book and made me really question the things that we value in our lives. I think this book should certainly be included in required reading lists for high school students and/or college students. I have recommended this book to many friends. Before this book, when people asked me, &quot;what is your favorite book&quot;?, I used to be at a loss, considering all the books I have read. No more!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I felt this was a really good story although initially I had problems getting through it because I hated the intolerance of the characters so much. Ms. Kingsolver writes persuasively and engagingly from each character's point of view throughout the story. So, if you are initially having problems sticking with the story, keep going, it gets better!To Ben from Derwood, MD, I'd advise you to remember that this is a work of fiction, that Ms. Kingsolver does not in any way say that all Christian men or all Christian missionaries behaved like Nathan Price. In fact, if you read the book, Price's predecessor did not behave at all like Price (gasp! they must be different people and different people can behave differently!) To say that one work of fiction can categorize and label all members of a religious faith (or any other group) is indeed an insult to the author's intentions and the abilities of readers everywhere to recognize individuals for what they are."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The story depicts a preacher's family uprooting from their small town in Georgia and moving to Kilanga, Congo in the 1950's. The family consists of 5 members: Nathan Price, Orleanna Price, Rachael Price, Leah Price, Adah Price (I should say Ecirp Hada), and little Ruth May Price. Nathan is a stern baptist father who keeps a tight leash around his family, Orleanna is a caring mother who looks out for the safety of her children, Rachael is a spoiled girl who considers herself Princess Rachael, Leah is a few minutes older than Adah and is an born leader, Adah is the younger twin and has a disability and lacks self confidence, and finally Ruth May Price is the youngest daughter and is a very curious and playful young girl.The story idea itself is not bad at all, infact I believe it is quite good. The problem is the way Kingsolver chose to write the book. I enjoyed the way she told the story through all five women of the family, but I detested how she dragged the story out as long as humanly possible. The story becomes very redundant after a while, and should definitely be at MOST 500 pages, but somehow Kingsolver managed to bring it to 650. Generally, when I read a book, I become extremely interested in the book and cannot put it down after about 100-200 pages. This never happened with The Poisonwood Bible; I never became truly interested with the book, in part because it is simply too dull. The worst part of the book is the last 150 pages; this section was a nice addition because it told the outcome of the lives of everyone in the family, but the way everything turns out is so rediculous it is sometimes funny. Some of the things that occur are simply disappointing and very unlikely.Overall, I would say this book deserves 3 stars because of the interesting style in which it was written and the fairly interesting storyline, but that is the absolute highest I am willing to give it, due to the redundancy and rediculousness of many sections of the book. I'm not sure I'll dare read another Kingsolver novel, but I have heard good things about &quot;The Bean Trees,&quot; so I may give her a second chance."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I don't know when I started liking the (audio)book, but my appetite for it became insatiable. I drove by myself to Albany, Georgia for a meeting (90 miles) just so I could have several hours of uninterrupted listening time.You read this book as if you are reading the diaries of five women: Orleanna Price, wife of a preacher sent to the Congo, and their four daughters.I think a big turnoff was starting the book with Orleanna Price. Beautiful prose, but very difficult to get into the feel of the book when this woman is &quot;talking.&quot; Am I that used to children's books? Do I need &quot;Once upon a time there were four sisters whose father was a preacher...&quot;? It's just that she is so descriptive and allegorical and whatever else that it just confused the heck out of me. I tried to read the novel and eventually checked out the audiotapes from the library in the hope that being read to would help me &quot;get into&quot; the book.Each chapter is devoted to the &quot;voice&quot; of a different character. It made it much easier to listen to Dean Robertson read the book and give each character a unique sound. I love how audiobooks allow me to &quot;read&quot; novels that I otherwise would not be able to.I'm not sure how I would recommend this book to others. It definitely was worth getting through the initial mire of wordiness. Maybe skip the first chapter with Orleanna and get to where they are packing for the trip. Then read the first chapter last.It is a fascinating insight into the clash of African culture with the white preacher-man come to save their souls. However, most of the novel is dedicated to the reaction of Reverend Price's blonde-haired daughters and wife to being thrustinto this foreign land.The novel spans several decades and we get to see the life-long effects of this missionary trip on the Price family."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is one of my favorite books of this year. Barbara Kingsolver demonstrates the full range of her virtuoso writing in the different voices of the mother and 4 daughters. My favorite voices were little Ruth May and da Vinci-genius Ada, both of whom are playgrounds for Kingsolver's own genius.I was raised as one of 3 Presbyterian missionary daughters in South Korea from 1966 through 1985, a time of political turmoil there. While our father was 180 degrees different from insane renegade Father Price, we did share some similar experiences to the Price daughters. Last summer we wrote down our childhood memories, and I can find echoes of Rachel, Leah and Ruth May in each of us. Alas, none of us share Ada's or Kingsolver's genius.But remember, this is a novel, written by a specific feminist liberal novelist, as expressed through 5 specific female points of view. Do not expect to agree with her history, but expect to be surprised by her insight into the human heart."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I really liked this book. Fascinating to read. I liked that the story was told by all memebers for the family except the Rev and to me that signaled his out of touch approach about the whole venture. Perhaps a bit long at the end. The portion in Africa where the girls grow up is really the story"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"&quot;The Poisonwood Bible,&quot; is an educational book describing life in the Congo through the eyes of five fictional women. At times you may find yourself dozing off wondering when you will finally reach page 543! The life of a stubborn missionary and his family is not always exciting. You better bake yourself a batch cookies to snack on with a pot of coffee to stay awake. While you are reading about Ruth May's battle with malaria, Leah's hunting escapades, Adah's cynical views of the world, and ignorant Rachel's love affairs be sure to keep taking sips from your coffee mug. All you men out there if you want action this book is not for you, but if you want to know how life in the Congo in 1959 affected people then be prepared to spend hours and hours reading what truly is a Bible!!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I read this book because a great number of people suggested it to me. The very, very beginning with the introductions of the characters is rather slow, but the book quickly picks up pace and doesn't let go. I immediately liked the character of Adah because she was a lot like me. She fiddles with words and numbers. Ruth May is a sweet if rather spoiled little girl who eventually runs into trouble. Rachel is the spoiled, preening eldest daughter in the family. She remains the most static of all the female characters. Leah is Adah's twin and she is the most dynamic character. She goes from thinking that her father is never wrong to making the area around Congo her home. In the end I identified with Leah the most. She rang the most true of all the characters save Anatole, the schoolteacher in the village that the family is at. I am them and they are me. Read this book for an experience like no other."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"http://www.watershed.winnipeg.mb.ca/bookcafe/bcpoisonwood.html&quot;IMAGINE A RUIN so strange it must never have happened.&quot; So begins Barbara Kingsolver's epic novel The Poisonwood Bible. In its 550 pages Kingsolver explains the ruin and the redemption that occur within a family that travels to Africa as missionaries in 1959. Amidst carpenter ant invasions, bouts of malaria, and political uprisings we are given a glimpse of the cultural, agricultural and economic turmoil of the Congo from 1960 to the present. Kingsolver chooses to write her narrative from the vantage point of the family's five women, who each explore their own journey back from Africa. In a sense, collectively these women ask: What did we do to Africa and how do we respond to that? At one point one of the daughters, Adah, asks: &quot;Will salvation be the death of me? &quot; This is a key question of the novel. Will salvation cause the death of our normal way of seeing things, or our normal way of being in the world? Each one of the women has to decide whether they are willing to open themselves to the possibilities of salvation and the freedom it entails."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is the first Kingsolver book I have read and it was compelling. First of all, she develops each of her characters in depth by having each of them tell their portion of the story. Secondly, she paints such a magnificant picture of life in the Congo that the reader can't possibly leave this book in ignorance. I don't think I would like to live under such primitive conditions but I certainly do have a deeper appreciation for the cycle of life that is so entirely different than my own. I found that this book gave me great insights into what I have in my own life."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I am a Korean. For many Koreans, our image of Africa is of &quot;monkey culture&quot;: primitive people running around in the jungle. Koreans (especially Korean Christians) could learn a lot from this book. Both in the way that the complexity of African culture is depicted, and by comparison to our own unhappy experience with colonialism and being subject to foreigners."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The five women whose voices carry the story -- the wife and 4 daughters of missionary Nathan Price -- tell the story of Africa as much as they tell of their own adventure there. This is the Africa -- the Belgian Congo -- newly &quot;independent&quot; after its exploitation by the European colonial powers. This is the Africa of villages, of village people, of the great rivers, of the great populations of animals and insects. It is also the Africa of politicians and military murderers. Read this book to learn about Africa as it was and is and ever will be, as well as to follow the growing-up of the five women (including the coming of age of the mother). Read this book in order to learn &quot;what we have done&quot; in and to Africa. Read this book to find out why, despite or perhaps because of what we have done, Africa is the ancestral home of all of us."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This was one of the best books I've read in a long time. I was swept away and felt like a participant. Rather than a story about a Baptist missionary and his family, I saw this as a tale about how a nation subdues another. How we (USA) typically go into a place, through our weight around, and force our traditions, laws, and religions down someone else's throat. Nathan Price was &quot;the rescuer&quot;, &quot;the world's policeman&quot;, the Unites States. He went to Congo as Leopold did - not to cherish it, but to overthrow it. To take away it's beauty and make it his own. His wife and daughters mimic other political entities as well - their reaction to the predicament.The book was well written, the characters well developed. The style of writing, where the various characters give voice to their view was outstanding. The book is long, but you won't be able to put it down. This is a must read, believe me."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Mr. Garrett, You forgot one other lesson we learned from Mrs. Kingsolvers book. White Men=Bad, White men= heartless and you prove that point by reading a deeply touching book without allowing your heart to hear what it had to say. All of Kingsolvers characters were fallible and it was simply a tale of humans making their way in extraordinary conditions. Each character related to these conditions in their own way without any one way being utterly right or wrong. I think that you missed the whole point by reading it with a cynics eye and you heart locked in a closet somewhere."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver was robbed of the pulitzer prize for this epic look at 4 sisters, a mother, and a priest father who move to the congo to carry out the father's mission. You want to kill the father through the whole book. He looks only at his work and completely ignores his family and their quarrels about moving to the congo. The result of this? The destruction of what the poor mother worked so hard to achieve: a family. From a sister dying to the others moving away one by one to the father going mad. The book looks at every detail of these girl's, their mother's, and father's life. So brilliantly written that i doubt anyone could match it's power. The book is the GONE WITH THE WIND of this century. Do not base this on Kingsolver's previous works, it shines far too high above the rest. Oh! in case you wanted to know, my favorite part of the book is the fact that we hear the story from the four sister's (Adah, Ruth May, Rachel, and Leah) point of view as well as the mothers. I beg you to pick this up and read it! and don't go to the library! This one is worth bying, hardcover is necessary."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I though this book was great, the characters were descibed in vivid detail and i got to know all of them quickly. I also think it was interesting how he showed the different point of veiws of each girl in the family. Although some chapters did drag, it was still worth reading to the end, my favorite part was especially the haunting fate of one of the character, which left me shaking after i read it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"If you're tired of murder, murder, murder...read this wonderful book full of new thoughts and ideas. I just loved it. I like books where you don't know where its going. A great book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book was recommended to me many times, so finally I got around to reading it. While Kingsolver's language is deft and skillful - I have read more than a few who fall short of her level - the book disappointed me. As a Christian myself, I found it hard to swallow that stereotype of a Baptist preacher that Reverend Price was. My favorite character was Leah, but I couldn't really relate to her any more than the others. Also, after the Price women left the village, the book seemed to plod. The rest just seemed to be a long, long, ending. Looking back on what I wrote, I realize I sound very critical so I will say that Kingsolver is a better writer than many will be. I think it is just that I received such glowing recommendations and I was let down."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I found the first two thirds of this book incredibly exciting and enjoyable. I loved the way events were strung together from five different angles. I thought the way the style of writing change depending on whether it was the mother or one of the daughters telling us the story was superb. I enjoyed the poetic and sensitive parts of the mother and Adah. The forthright Leah and the so very cute parts of Ruth May were also a pleasure to read. I think Barbara Kingsolver had trouble trying to write for Rachel Price, an ignorant, self absorbed and mean spirited teenager and a woman.I was so captivated by the beautiful writing of Orleanna, in the first section and found the book impossible to put down after that. The way Kingsolver described life in a Congo village from the five different perspectives made feel like I was actually there, smelling the forest and looking over the little black kids in rags playing in the red dust.I loved the parts about the language and how one word can mean so many different things, that at times are related yet appear almost opposite. I found myself laughing out loud at the \\"Tata Jesus is bangala\\", which what Rev. Price used to come closer to the villagers yet had a different meaning from what he intended. Kingsolver's appreciation of the Congolese culture, people and habits was rooted in her appreciation of the linguistic subtleties of their language. She did a masterful job getting this across to the reader.My main criticism of this book, is the way some of the characters come across so very narrow. Rev. Price and Rachel practically have nothing good about them, both are self centered and generally mean spirited. On the other hand Anatole is perfection itself in every facet. The other characters were much better rounded and a lot more believable.As to the politics of the book, even though I do not know much about Congolese and Belgian colonial history, I suspect Kingsolver analysis is again one sided and overly romantic. (I finished reading this book on the day Mugabe said he would rule over Zimbabwe even if he loses the elections.) I struggle to think of one African leader from the liberation movements of the 1960's who did not end up an oppressive dictator. Could Lumemmba have been a different kind of a leader? No one will ever know."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"It took me a while to decide to read this, being as different as it seemed from Barbara Kingsolver's earlier work. And it *is* different, though in a very interesting way. It is broad in scope, focused in detail and emotion, and a truly compelling read. The focus on the four sisters, with some light shed by the mother, draws the reader in as the pieces of the story begin to fall into place. The prose is lyrical, the voices of the sisters are consistent and imaginative, and the political-historical context of the tangled geopolitical web that was colonial-postcolonial Africa is well drawn. One of my few quibbles: While there are more than a few deliberate instances of telegraphing tragedy, these are a little distracting. Overall, a tremendous work that should be given your attention; you'll be rewarded."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book by Barbara Kingsolver. It was much, much better than her Animal Dreams book. The first 200 pages went by REALLY fast, but after Ruth May's disaster, it got boring. I couldn't put the book down for the firtst half, but then I couldn't finish the book either because it was boring. But I finished it! She writes with great passion and it feels like we are there!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I advise caution, for there is a heavy load of doctrinaire politics interlarded in this book (and I can't judge its accuracy) but it turns an otherwise gripping novel into sermonizing at times, wrong even if it's right. Then there is the characteristic modern bias against missionaries. The author achieves this by picking the worst possible case, a demented Baptist evangelist who is not like most of the Baptist clergy I know. (Of course we do have a notorious one just a ways away from here in Topeka!) In my Episcopal Church here we have black people at every service who have come from Africa and the Caribbean with fond memories of and firm loyalty to their Church and its missionary background. If it weren't for missionaries we of British background would still be dyeing ourselves blue and worshipping mistletoe (for which I can think of better uses). The novel itself is generally written with extreme competence. I particular favor palindromatic Adah. Do read it, but Kingsolver has planted some green mambas in the chicken house."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is one of the best books to come along in a very long time. Barbara Kingsolver has an incredible gift. Her insight into human life - our strengths and frailties - is uncanny. I was right there with the characters throughout the book. Her knowledge of the history of the Congo was excellent. This is one of the best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver's book uses the literary style of having several characters tell the story from each perspective. That is something the reader needs to know at the outset. It was a maddening experience for a hundred pages or so. Then the book fell into a rhythm. This story of the Congo in the 50's and 60's concerns a preacher and his family. Nathan Price uses his minister to cover up guilt from a World War II experience and his wife and four daughters pay the price. The novel is full of African lore, language and ecology. The story itself comes to a climax a little over halfway through. The denouement was long and tedious."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Well l had great expectations after The Bean Trees which I really loved. Unfortunately this story failed to impress me as much.Nathan Price, preacher, drags his wife and four daughters into the Congo to tame the locals. However, nothing prepared him for what his life and his family's would be like there. It's told in 5 different voices, the daughters and his wife's, and it was really interesting to get alternative views from them.But ultimately I didn't get captured by this book or dislike Nathan as intensely as the father in The Mosquito Coast.There are some touching images in this book, the first page of the mother describing the jungle is perfect, as is the 'laying out' of one of her daughters, which is devestatingly heartbreaking. I just felt that the book should've ended after the mother walked away from the home. After that I found it hard to get back into the book and just flicked through from there."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver does an absolutely masterful job in describing both her characters and historical significance of the period. Yes, there are &quot;evil whites&quot; and &quot;good blacks&quot;, in the book, but there are also good whites and evil blacks. More to the point, noone is stereotyped. I particularly enjoyed the character Adah -- she was portrayed as having a complex personality, whimsical one moment, intellectual the next. It is particularly gratifying to me, as a person with a disability, to see such a complex characterization of a fictional character with a disability. Rather than circumscribe her personality, Adah's disability lends a subtle nuance to how she views others in her world. This is a wonderful book!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"As the story of Nathan Price's family unfolds from the perspectives of his 3 daughters and his wife I really felt that the Congo was alive, and seeping through the pages into my life. It truly takes over while you read it, the beautifully strange way that Adah writes, the difficult awakening of Leah's sense of truth and justice and the innocent spirituality of Ruth May. It is a stunning story backed up by even more stunning characterisation. Brilliant."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I really thought of giving up on this one. I had read all of Kingsolver's other books, and loved them. But, I'm glad I stuck with it. I really enjoyed her use of the different family member's 'voices' in the different segments."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"If found myself drowning in the heat and discomfort of Africa. I loved every moment of this book, even the political developments."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"First, I will gladly concede that Ms. Kingsolver is a talented writer. Although a little too bent on man- and Christianity-bashing for my taste (and I am female and barely Christian myself, for the record), I found the first two-thirds of the book an engaging read. It also really made me think, as any good book should. If Ms. Kingsolver had stopped there, I would probably have given the book 4 stars. However, the last third was terrible. The characters behave unbelievably in the context of how they had been portrayed up until that point. The book becomes preachy and one-sided. The man/Christianity bashing gets out of control. I find it infuriating that women feel they have to have \\"bad men\\" as foils for their \\"strong women.\\"In short, what began as an interesting, thought-provoking, enjoyable read, ended leaving a terrible taste in my mouth."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"One hundred years from now, if high school students AREN'T reading Barbara Kingsolver in their American Lit classes, I'd be very surprised. This is the stuff of which great literature is made. Up until the last 1/4 - 1/3 of the book, I would have given this book 5 stars and rated it as one of the best books I've ever read.Once in the home stretch, however, the treatment became a little heavy-handed. Up to that point, the book was quite effective in delivering Kingsolver's message.All in all, this remains one of those books that leaves you feeling more enlightened for having read it.Bravo, Barbara Kingsolver!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I won't belabor the points already made, but if your perspective has been forever skewed by experience in Africa, Kingsolver puts into words everything most of us cannot. I have had my entire family read it and i think they understand me as a result. I couldn't put this book down (physically) even after I finished it, for several hours."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Some authors write one good book and quit. Some authors write one good book and should quit. Barbara Kingsolver writes one excellent story after another and gets better with each one. With The Poisonwood Bible, she was not content to create the great American novel. She conquered two continents. I admire and envy her extraordinary skill. The Poisonwood Bible will one day be on the classics shelf both for its messages and its considerable beauty."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I read this book almost as soon as it was available. Kingsolver has been criticized for wearing her political heart on her sleeve, but this is a strength, not a weakness in a culture that desperately needs to be better informed.Her use of the female story-tellers offers us a wonderful point of view in a time when the feminine perspective is still sadly unheard. I find it interesting, however, that reviews and synopses begin by describing this as a story about &quot;Nathan Price and his family.&quot; While certainly the catalyst, Nathan is the least of the characters. The story is about Orleanna, Rachel, Adah, Leah, and Ruth May. Without realizing it, we are going along with an outdated notion of who represents the family. Though unintentional, it undermines the very shift in perspective that the book is trying to achieve.Still, don't let this deter you. READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I love Kingsolver's novels. She evokes a richness of time, people, and place that is so rare in popular fiction. Poisonwood didn't disappoint in regard to interesting and multi-faceted characters and setting. The women in this story are fascinating in their diversity, and the ways they come to deal with the situations that face them in the Congo. I especially enjoyed the humor that laced their narratives. This story was excellent until the last 100 pages when Kingsolver delved into the politics of the region. While I learned some valuable history lessons, I think novel could have ended much sooner. I hope Kingsolver keeps enlightening us with her outstanding fiction, but I hope she refrains from getting too political in future novels. Her voice is a crucial addition to contemporary women's fiction"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book is a must read, especially for those persons who perceive themselves as superior to others based on their own self-righteous perceptions. This book helps those super self-righteous beings to see themselves in a more global light. Kingsolver's research is impeccable and makes this book historical fiction. The characters reach into your psyche in a three-dimensional way. You'll find yourself weeping, then chuckling, and sometimes even belly laughing. This book has far more depth than Kingsolver's other novels. Read it!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I first discovered Barbara Kingsolver several years ago and loved her novels, The Bean Trees, and Pigs in Heaven. Even though she, herself, is not Native American, her books stand as were beacons of enlightenment about their often misunderstood world today and have been praised throughout the world. The Poisonwood Bible is a more ambitious book, and the landscape is the Belgian Congo, but her voice lays bare the same kind of clashes and misunderstandings that exist between cultures.Well researched and deeply moving, it tells the story of a missionary's family from Georgia who move to the Congo in the late 1950s. The father is a religious fanatic, driven to convert the world to his brand of Christianity .His wife and four daughters have no choice but to respect his wishes. Using the technique of alternating first-person voices, each chapter is told from the point of view of these five female family members.A poisonwood tree grows by their house. It is beautiful but it causes rashes and boils on the skin. It's a great metaphor.There is the mother, Orleanna Price, who struggles daily with the effort of keeping her family together in a world that is suddenly devoid of electricity, plumbing and food. Precious wood must be found for the stove, water must be boiled to remove parasites, and vegetables do not grow. The oldest daughter, Rachel is 16. She misses her friends and her life in Georgia and yearns for nailpolish and hairdos. Then there are twins of 14: Leah and Adah. Both are smart and open to learn about the world around them but Adah cannot speak or move one side of her body. The littlest one, Ruth May, at age 5 teaches the native children to play games.Each one of these voices is totally distinct from each other and tells her tale in her own distinctive way. Their overlapping views of the same incident turned them into multifaceted prisms instead of simple story lines. I wanted nothing more to go on reading, finding myself in their world, feeling the heat and the beauty of Africa as each one, in her own way, discovered her own Africa.But Africa was changing even as they were . Revolution was happening. It was dangerous for the missionaries. The father refused to leave. And the family gets caught up in total upheaval. When one of the daughters dies and I felt the grief throughout my bones. It wasn't just happening to a person in a book. I had known her so well that I, too, mourned the loss and felt their struggle to leave the madness. Felt the raging fever of malaria, saw how each had changed.The last third of the book follows the surviving women through the next 30 years of African and American history. It is a political statement and it opened a world for me I never even knew existed. Often in books that span 40 years, the first part of the book is the best. But this book even got better as it moved along. It's 543 pages long and I was sorry to see it end.This is a truly important book. It sent me to the internet immediately to learn more. I've lived my comfortable life here in the United States all these years and never had any understanding about what Africa was like. In this one book, Ms. Kingsolver brings me there. She does it with her art. She is more than just telling a story. She is opening people's eyes. Hooray for her!I give this book my very highest recommendation. Read it!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book is very well written and I would recommend it anytime, anywhere. The words flow on the pages and you gather a great deal of insight into this families dynamics. The individual stories, taking place at certain times, are magnificent. The story takes place at the time of the Belgian Congo and I wish we had a little more history in the story, but then again, that's not what this novel was about. It was about the family dynamics and what each and every one of them learned from their experiences in the Congo at this particular time and how it affected their lives and those around them. I loved how each character was dealt with."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I am an avid reader, particularly women's fiction. I have been a Kingsolver fan from her first novel. This book is her absolute best. Not only does she produce a fabulous story, her story-telling technique adds so much dimension to her characters. I could not put it down."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I have read all of Barbara Kingsolver's previous novels and while I enjoyed them all, I feel this is her strongest and most powerful work yet. The characters in this book were so well developed that I could anticipate their thoughts and actions as I might those of a family member or close friend. I was transformed by this magic book and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Transporting, mind-expanding, thought-provoking novel exquisitely written. Read it. I found the intense, evolving struggles within this family to be wonderfully vivid in all their disturbing intricacies."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Writing a story through the voices of 5 different women is ingenious. I love Rachel's malpropisms, am deeply touched by the mother's suffering and feel I know all the girls well as I read. Kingsolver knows human development and her history and what is wrong and what is right in the world. I wait for her books to come out,but hope she is having a good life if she isn't consumed with publication"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This novel is one of the finest I've read this year. The characters and their voices are so distinct, so compelling, their actions so believable, that I could not stop reading. The players move along in a doomed grace that is hilarious and tragic and haunting, all at once. No, it isn't a perfect book. Great books are rarely perfect, as they are far too ambitious for gem-like perfection. The first part of the story is tense and interwoven, as threatening and inexorable and the Congolese jungle. The last thirty years sprawl around, untidy and unfocused, and at times the later story is more a political complaint than a narrative. It reminds me of the narrator in Canada at the end of Owen Meany. I can live without lectures; illustration of the conditions through plot action is far more telling. I know that other readers needed to hear what happened to this family and are happy for the last section. I wish this had been done in a sequel. I could have happily read another, more gently unfolded book about these women."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"&quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; is without a doubt the best book I have read all year. I was completely engrossed with this epic story, and thoroughly enjoyed every word. I am the oldest child in my family with seven siblings, five of whom are girls, and I could relate so well to the personalities reflected in Rachel, Leah, Adah and Ruth May. Our father is also deeply religious, and oftentimes obscure and distant, and the tense scenes from the book involving Nathan Price also felt very familiar to me.The book depicted the human condition so candidly, showing us the broad range of responses that can come from a single situation. It was fascinating to see what each of the girls chose to do with their lives, and how deeply the African experience affected them.Thank you, Barbara Kingsolver! You have touched many of us with this beautiful work."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This form was perfected by Faulkner in the Sound and The Fury. Kingsolver's approach is twice as long without the wonderful story telling ability that Faulkner had.The African portions of the book have been done before by Nadine Gordimer. Gordimer and Faulkner were both Nobel Prize winners: Kingsolver won't be."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver provides an interesting perspective on missionary communities, as imagined through the eyes of a secular, progressive and politically correct American writing at the end of the twentieth century. Her technique of using the &quot;voice&quot; of the various children (as well as the mother) of a particular missionary family is especially compelling. That said, some sections are either exaggerated or &quot;tone deaf&quot; when it comes to capturing what it is really like to be raised in such a community. At least two other recently published books, also available through amazon, provide insightful, first hand perspectives on such an upbringing: &quot;Swimming in the Congo&quot; by Margaret Meyer (Milkwood, 1996), who was herself raised in a fundamentalist missionary household in Congo; and &quot;Some Far And Distant Place&quot; by Jonathan Addleton (University of Georgia Press, 1997), whose father, like the protoganist of &quot;The Poisonwood Bible,&quot; was a Baptist missionary from rural Georgia. Both these books provide interested readers with an &quot;insider's perspective&quot; on missionary communities that is understandably missing in Barbara Kingsolver new work."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara, Barbara, for shame! If you are going to create the Devil incarnate and place him, with 5 female victims, in the midst of the Congolese jungle in the guise of a white Baptist minister, then the least you could do is let Nathan Price speak for himself. Instead, you filter all of our perceptions of this tortured and hateful man through the eyes of his wife--who no longer believes in him or his religion, but cannot leave until tragedy strikes--or his daughters. All too often children judge their parents with either too much forgiveness or too much harshness, and the latter is certainly the case here. Although I enjoyed &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; and its depiction of native Africa very much, I can't help feeling robbed that you never let Nathan speak for himself. Oh, he quotes the Bible right and left, but you never let us see what inner changes have driven him to risk his family's life and health in Africa. Even worse, once tragedy has struck, you don't even let Nathan preach--all we hear are rumors passed from mouth to mouth until one of the girls passes them on to us. So, although I obviously liked the novel and although I probably would agree with most of the positive statements by other reviewers--thus the 4-star rating--I was disappointed in your lack of balance."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"If Barbara Kingslover set out to educate Americans about the history and politics of the Congo then I would say she had limited success. (Although most Americans know very little of the history and politics of the Congo, so any information would be considered an education.) If she set out to write a literary novel I would say she failed miserably.This book was didactic, overwritten, and way too long. Most of the characters were flat, and all were unsympathetic. Two of the characters (Orleana the mother and Leah one of the daughters) were really only used as mouthpieces for Kingslover's political views about the Congo, nee Zaire. Because this book is overwritten few people will be interested enough to stick with it (several other friends of mine have said they started it but gave up) long enough to even learn much about the Congo, so in some respects I think that she may have even failed in educating her audience.This book was theme driven; and there were plenty of them--religion, politics, family, but the main theme was oppression. Oppression of the family by the misguided religious zealot father; oppression of the people in the Congo by rich and powerful countries like America; all good and worthy themes. However, Kingslover could not resist beating us over the head with these themes, and spelling every single thing out for us over and over again. I think her need for justice in the Congo got the best of her writing style--she wanted to make damn sure there was no misunderstanding on what she thought had gone wrong in the Congo and who's fault it was. She used no literary allusion (other than the bible-and even that she pretty much spelled out for us), and no symbolism other than the one pet parrot they owned but the father kicked out of the house and it eventually died because it couldn't live in the wild anymore. Everything else she told us straight up, so there was no room for misinterpretation is my guess. But part of good literature is letting the reader figure out the the themes and symbolism themselves.I would NOT recommend this book, but think it does have some potential to be made into a big Hollywood movie. Hollywood loves this kind of pseudo literary, &quot;political message&quot; movie. I'm sure they could condense this tome down to 90 minutes of celluloid and it might actually pique some interest in an audience."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kingsolver draws on her childhood years in the Congo to provide a vivid portrayal of demented missionary life during the last days of colonialism. She has the ability to enhance your imagination of the life in equatorial Africa; unfortunately, the overbearing feminism and missionary phobia reduce the novel to a monologue of her prejudice. It is ironic that only the viewpoints of four daughters and the wife are presented while the missionary father is not able to provide his perspective. I caution you to compare this fiction to the non-fiction of such 1960's contemporary missionaries as Mother Theresa, Viggo Olsen, or Helen Roseveare or to the african commitments by Albert Scheitzer, Mary Slessor or David Livingstone. This book is worth reading, but the reader should be aware of the slanted perspective of the noble native versus United States imperialism, pristine Africa versus missionary incursion, and a morality of self-designed naturalism versus an intelligent, personal creator. Enjoy the book!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Wow!!! I didn't know what to expect when this book was assigned for our book group. We were told, basically, what it was about... a baptist minister, his wife and 4 daughters going to Africa for a ministry. Ok. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised! The way it is approached, from 5 different attitudes and life experiences... it just really amazed me at the thought processes that would had to have been in order for this book to be written! There were so many themes to consider and think about. Right away I could feel the fear in their silence and obedience to Nathan. The sense of humor of each girl. The growing, becoming... from experience. It even made me think about other cultures and \\"are they really in 'need' from others who don't understand their culture? So much to think about. What a gift the author has. Thank you."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Hi i'm 13 years old and I have 30pages left. I Know that you must be thinking that I am a 13 year old what do I know but let me tell how I started reading it.o.k I had just finished a book and i was looking for a new book and my mom suggested thist book. so i tried it but sadly it was to hard for me so my mom is reading it with me. This story starts in 1959. A famly of 6 is goes to Africa for the father is a preacher. The father is not the main character. the 5 main chracters are the mom Orleanna Price,Leah Price( a tom boy who is all was trying to show her father that she is the best.she is 15 years old.)Ruth may(the youngest of them all she is 5 years old),Rachel(a very self centered girl of 16) and my favorite Adah (Leah's twin sister). She and Leah are identical but Adah has a slight deficit..half of her body doesn't work. So you might think she is not smart but she is the smartest one of all. She sees things backwardss so I found her the hardest to read he for she consistently starts talking backwards. she is so interesting.) I highy reccomenmend it. it is so good. some of the time I cried and sometimes I laughed so hard I thought that I would die of laughter. Sometime I was left speechless and i had to stop reading so i could mull things over. I love the bookand i hope you do to. this book made me look at things in a whole new way.I always knew africa was a hard inbut this book brings you there. it is a great book.A+++++"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver takes big risks with this novel, spreading the points of view among four children and one woman. Sometimes it works beautifully and she is able to convey vividly their different perceptions of the Congo, the missionary zeal, international politics, and the dismantling of a family. Sometimes, it's hard to believe the point of view of the five year old, but it's exciting to see the author experiment and bring the story alive, keep the reader focused and involved, even with the rapid shifting of viewpoints. All I can say, one novelist to another, is Bravo Barbara! Well -done!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I feel Barbara Kingsolver's strengths have always been characterization and plot. This is a 500+ word page-turner. Two features of this book, I feel, take Kingsolver's work to a new level: the depth of her research into the politics and indigenous cultures of the Congo/Zaire from the 1950's to the present time impressed me as did her skill in presenting her narrative in four different voices which change as the characters age. Ms. Kingsolver also skillfully presents, as she has in her previous books, southern U.S.A. culture embodied in the Baptist missionary Price family."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The depth of insight Kingsolver's novel displays in regard to mother-daughter and sibling relationships is astounding. As one of five daughters who vied for individual maternal attention while a child, and as a mother now of four mid-to-late adolescents, I know that Kingsolver's novel tells it like it is (or was) for anyone of similar circumstances, despite the setting of his or her childhood. Nevertheless, the story of the Congo's struggle for independence was an appropriate though poignant backdrop. Read the book, and then ask yourself these questions. What child would you choose to save if faced with the dilemma? When or when is not 'the marriage' or 'the children' or 'her' needs or 'hers' more important than one's own needs? What impact do childhood experiences have on the adult psyche? What is the quality of your own relationships with your adult siblings? This book was so tremendously insightful--a female survival story. My 17-year old daughter, a huge reader of Dosteovsky and Kaye Gibbons, began reading the novel over my shoulder and was instantly hooked. My book kept disappearing on me! We had a great time discussing the novel's plot, characterization, and symbolism. Thank you, Barbara Kingsolver, for this great novel. Oprah, have you looked at this one?"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I have read everything that Kingsolver has ever written and The Poisonwood Bible is not only her most ambitious but also her best. I read the book four months ago and I still can't get the Price family out of my head. They deserve to go down in history as one of the compelling and great families of American fiction."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Many, I fear most, Americans will resist Kingsolver's insights into American intervention in African affairs. We don't want to admit our shameless colonialism, our arrogant assumption that all the world's riches belong to us. But, as she makes all too clear, our intevention is often skewed by national self-interest and frequently misinterpreted on the home front. We can learn a lot from an open-minded reading of Poisonwood Bible."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Our bookclub just finished reading it and we were up until midnight discussing all aspects of it. The story is told on many levels and the voices are all compelling and realistic. It is a must read for everyone...I just orderd the Pen/Faulkner winner because I can't imagine any of 1998's other selections being better!!! This is a great selection for a reading group!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Stories are for listening to as well as reading, and this novel is superb on tape. Read wonderfully by Dean Robertson (a woman) it will make the miles fly by! This story strongly lends itself to the ancient tradition of telling/listening. Get it unabridged. It is expensive (it takes about 16 hours to listen to) but one of the best I have listened to. I savored it, replaying parts of it over and over to catch the wonder of the prose. The &quot;voices&quot; of the women are distinct and engaging to listen to. As good or better than to read. Worth every cent! If you can't afford it, share the cost with a friend, but do LISTEN!!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"POISONWOOD BIBLE WAS MY FIRST TASTE OF BARBARA KINGSOLVER, BUT CERTAINLY NOT MY LAST. HER STORY OF THE PRICE FAMILY, BABTIST MISSIONARIES TRANSPLANTED TO THE CONGO IN 1959 WAS EXTRAORDINARY. WHAT STRUCK ME MOST ABOUT THIS BOOK WAS THE AFRICAN VIEWPOINT. SO OFTEN WHITES MOVE IN SOMEWHERE TO &quot;IMPROVE&quot; AND ONLY DO DAMAGE. AS THE OUSTED MISSIONARY TOLD, THINK OF YOURSELF AS A BRANCH OFF THE TREE OF AFRICA. WHO AND WHAT CHANGES DURING THEIR YEAR IN THE CONGO IS THE REAL STORY."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Religious fanatic father,Nathan Price, brings family of naive wife and four, young &quot;apostle&quot; daughters from Bethlehem, Georgia to the Congo. Even though he seems to decide that one year mission service is his goal, reader senses that Nathan cares not for measured time in which to accomplish his goal of conversion. Rather, we see an evangelist who disregards the constraints of time in conversion process. Avoiding familial responsibilities and blind to ordinary needs of his own flesh and blood, the father abandons, mentally and emotionally, his wife and children only to be confronted by African medicine man and natives who reject his teachings. Through a slowly revealed evolutionary process, wife and children realize they must ultimately save themselves from their human destiny in the Congo. This story, told individually by characters, reaches its climax as female members either remain in the African continent under unusual circumstances, or escape the Congo for a better life in America. Truly the story is cathartic for anyone who has ever been abandoned or was forced to care for himself, but it expresses also, in its look backward, a means of accepting one's human abilities, needs and capabilities. The women free themselves from their father's &quot;heart of darkness&quot; and leave behind their strong inhibitions and the Congo. Religious impact upon the human psyche, grinding poverty and near starvation as well as responsibility to oneself in a time of darkness and misery add to the strong emotional impact of this story. Religious ideas which once strengthened moral convictions in these young people, become not simply underpinnings of their emotional character, but as the chidren mature, now become stabilizers which help develop perspective for growth. Bible verses no longer become forms of &quot;punishment&quot; but later become means of expressing one's personal growth --contrasted, in Adah's case with poetry of Emily Dickinson. Although the main story focuses upon one year in the lives of our characters, the final chapters reveal the strength of these women in later years - leaving no looming questions in the mind of the reader as to their adult destinies. What a story! Not soon forgotten!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kingslover's new book is her most incredible yet. The paradigm of country vs. family vs. God creates a spellbinding tale of misery and triumph, and how one decision can change a generation forever. I literally could not put this novel down. I have tremendous praise for the Poisonwood Bible."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is one of those books, that upon starting, you don't want to end. Even though you want to devour the whole thing in one reading, you stretch it out over a week, a month, anything to keep the characters alive in the narrative.In response to other reviewers-there is no drop off the last third. In fact, I liked it even better seeing how the characters grew up. The political history is tastefully done-the characters come to conclusions based on their experiences and personal history. I was very interested to learn about the whole Congolese cultural, like I had learned about Afghanistan in \\"Kite Runner\\". Finally, Rachel's chapters are not annoying, or boring. I'm a teenager and I can tell you that her voice rings as true as the others. Not everyone in novels has to be perfect and just to be likable! In fact, if everyone acted like Leah (people who've read the book will understand), it wouldn't be a very good book at all. The different perspectives make this book shine. It is necessary to have a foil to all the righteousness-the balance-a theme expressed many times in the book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Of the numerous books I read in 2006, Barbara Kingsolver's \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" stands atop the list, its only company being Ayn Rand's \\"The Fountainhead\\" and John Steinbeck's \\"East of Eden\\". The book is a triumphant celebration of Kingsolver's writing skills, its gripping narration told in the first person alternatively by the wife and 4 daughters of the single-minded missionary, Reverand Price. The magificence of the novel, which spans three generations of the Price family beginning in 1959, shines through on virtually every page. The five voices bring the reader effortlessly through the family's ordeal. The narration is thoughtful and philosophical, without being complicated or preachy. It mixes themes of religion, family, individualism, and spirituality without forcing the reader to endure a homily. It is a simple yet complex work that evoked in me a wide range of emotions, from laughter to sadness and, at the very end, a burst of tears. In its own way, it is a damn good history lesson about the turbulent Congo and a place now known as Zaire. I can't imagine a person reading this book and not emerging much richer for the experience. I'm just sorry Amazon allows only 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I loved most of this book. The story of the trials faced by an American missionary and his reluctant wife and four daughters in the Congo was fascinating. I really liked reading the story from the different points of view; it gave a much more well rounded view of how strange, often terrifying and sometimes beautiful life as a foreigner in Africa was.The problem I had with the book was that it was far too long. The story should have been over when the African mission ended. It's always interesting to speculate what may have happened to characters after the end of a novel, and often a brief epilogue satisfies that curiosity, but this story devoted far too much space to following the characters for years and years after the climax of the story."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book was given to me when I was 14 as a Christmas gift. I left it on my bookshelf to collect dust until I was eighteen. So thats my first piece of advice, this book will do nothing for a child. Wait until you can fully appriciate it before you attempt it. When I first tried to read it, I got through the first chapter and a half, unimpressed by the little I understood of it. Even at 18, I'm sure I missed some of it.However, what I was able to grasp was brilliant. My favorite genre is historical fiction, usually set in ancient times, or at the very latest, the renaissance. I like to read books withdrawn from the world and society I live in. This book both granted me that wish and took it away. Reading about ancient Egypt is as removed from modern New York city as reading about a missionary family with four young girls adjusting to life in the congo. I enjoyed hearing about a life so withdrawn from my own. At first, the switch between speakers every few pages was very annoying, I want to be involved intimatly in the life of one character, and not briefly touch on the lives of every woman in the family. I got used to it, and although Kingsolver is not able to completely make herself sound like a 6 year old when she speaks for Ruth May, or a stupid self absorbed teenager when she speaks for Rachel, it becomes believeable. Kingsolver simply isn't able to hide remove her own insight from her characters, which doesn't help her to make them sound like 5 independant personalities. Other than that, I learned so much about human nature and the world away from my own corner of it. It opened my eyes to how fundamentally different people can be, even when they are so closly related in blood and experience. I don't want to give anything away about the plot, but I strongly recommend this book. It wasn't a page-turner, but it was definitly rewarding when I finished it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Wonderful! The four daughters are very independent; it is hard to believe they are all described by the same author. This is an example of truly skilled and masterful writing. A tour-de-force of a remarkable family whose members live remarkable lives. You will laugh and cry, but most of all you will think about this book long after you've read the last page."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"A flawed, but beautifully written novel about culture clash set in the Congo c. 1960.The Poisonwood Bible presents a missionary \\"worst case scenario\\". A stubborn, inadequately prepared (and, it would seem, inadequately supported) missionary hiding war time guilt launches himself and his family into a mission in the Congo in an attempt to find \\"redemption\\". The country is about to erupt into political instability formented by his sending nation. Whilst the best cases perhaps makes for less dramatic reading, as a male evangelical Christian I couldn't help feeling sorry for Nathaniel Price. Thrown into all this, and then denied a voice. True, Kingsolver's interest is in his four daughters, and this is their story, but white, male, evangelical does make for a soft target in these politically correct times.The true end of the novel occurs about 400 pages in. The last 200 pages, though well written, represent a ragged, overly long ending, where the author attempts to tie up the lose ends over the next 30 years. This reminded me of Captain Corelli.The author's attitude to Christianity remains unsolved. While I don't think that a Southern Baptist missionary would present baptism as salvation (as it is implied that Nathaniel Price does in the novel), the Brother Fowles' cameo shows a certain sympathy. A British writer would have likely to have shown much more cynicism and misunderstanding. The author's target is more male pride and ego than the Christian faith.Despite its flaws, the Poisonwood Bible richly deserves a five star rating and \\"classic\\" epiphets. I found the main characters to be believable (ok, you might not meet many people like them in, say, Glasgow). The technique of the daughters telling the story, which could so easily have flopped, works very well. I haven't enjoyed a contemporary novel so much since Captain Corelli's Mandoli and I thoroughly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I'll spare you the description of what the book is about since there are a lot of reviews on this book. I will tell you that I enjoyed the characters and how well the author was able to develop them to the point where you felt like you knew them. However, this book was a little long for my taste and I actually took a recess from reading it, read something else and then went back to it. I think it could have been wrapped up 100 pages sooner. It's worth reading but moves a little slow."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"It took me years to finally get around to reading this Oprah book, but I'm glad that I finally did!The story of a preacher, his wife and 4 daughters ministering in Congo- The Poisonwood Bible is a fascinating read. Seeing life from not just one person's point of view- but 5 pov's- gave this book it's movement and life. The stories woven throughout, the experiences, are unforgettable. You come to care for each person as they are going through the most trying and difficult experiences- trying to survive in a foreign country so different from their own. And also during a time of much strife in Congo alone.I'd certainly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in not just a novel of life experience, but also of history. The words are woven together not un-poetically and this makes a novel of over 500 pages hard to put down."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I just finished reading this book a few minutes ago and I am already looking for another piece of fiction that will keep me as engaged as this book did. I was constantly intrigued by the Price's predicament in the Congo and wanted to cheer on Orleanna as she stood up to her husband. The writing was brilliant and I enjoyed the different points of view.I am someone who doesn't have loads of time to read, but I enjoy books that help me escape from reality and challenge me to think. This book is incredible and has become one of my favorites."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"After reading The Bean Trees in high school, I became very fascinated with Barbara Kingsolver's work. This book certainly did not disappoint.The story is told through five perspectives: the mother (Orleanna), the eldest daughter (Rachel), a set of twins (Leah and Adah) and the baby (Ruth May). The Price family, led by minister father Nathan, moves to the Congo on a missionary trip to help bring the word of God to the African peoples. There were many early signs that the mission would be unsuccessful but Nathan would hear nothing of it.Many of the trials and tribulations are borne upon the women in this family which explains why they tell the story. Each girl gives their summation from their own consciousness. You see how the small community treats a 16 year old girl with long blonde hair as a treasure, never seeing a girl so white or hair so long. Many observations are made like this as the story progresses. We are able to watch the girls grow up as their adaptation of African life takes hold.Kingsolver does a wonderful job of weaving the political upheaval of the time into this story as it affects the Price family. I have to admit that I was only vaguely familiar with the activity of this time and this book gave an outsider's perspective on a country that was supposedly aided by the richest nations.Character development is the strongest attribute to this book and the continuity from character to character is fluid as not to lose any detail. I have read novels before where the story was told through several characters but none have been able to form such a complete story in my mind.I highly recommend this book. Do not be daunted by it's size, the read is quick and captivating."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"A story that is profound in detail on the history of the Congo, and an interesting exercise in voice as the story is told in alternating chapters by a mother and her 4 very different daughters. The underlying premise and the abdication of paternal care by the father is rather difficult and uncomfortable to swallow. A decent yarn, but a long read and nowhere near as pleasant and humorous as her previous works."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"After having read Animal Dreams, The Bean Trees, Pigs in Heaven, High Tide in Tucson, and Homeland and Other Stories, I loved The Poisonwood Bible. Granted, Kingsolver might not have portrayed a Baptist preacher very accurately (as one review suggests), she gave a very good picture of a religious fanantic, someone who would defy common sense and relocate his entire family to a world he knows nothing about. Especially a world which does not welcome him.And the descriptions of the girls were wonderful. They had individual voices, which changed and matured with age. This is clearly seen in Leah, who started out as a child who would do anything to please her father, and ended up the most rebellious of the four girls.This is a wonderful read, I can not stress that any further. I read it on my vacation to Europe, and I wanted to go home to read this book, instead of wondering the streets of Florence. I recommend it highly to anyone looking for an adventure full of love, life, and everything in between."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"You really have to start reading some of the great contemporary novels, which deal with one's childrens' fates, and how they interact with ours, and after a few of them, you start to realize, there are people out there who have been through it, really been through it, just as we are going through it. I suggest Barbara Kingsolver and Iris Murdoch, for instance. At first you think &quot;WHAT?&quot; but then you find out, they know what it is to endure marriage and child-raising, and THEY HAVE SEEN IT ALL. It's so important to read. Otherwise we think that we are keeping secrets that must not be revealed, for shame. But believe me, we women in-the-thick-of-it-with-not-much-time-to-read are not alone. There are those who broke through and wrote books for us. We owe it to them to read their books! This is one of those books."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Of all the characters that were profiled in THE POISONWOOD BIBLE I felt that Rachael got to me the most. Her self-centeredness and inability to grow is reflected in alot of women I know today. Kingsolver has forced me to reach deep within myself: which way would I have handled that Congo experience? Pride keeps me from admitting that I may have acted like the materialistic and vain teenager who was always pining for the vapid things that fill up one's life - an yet...don't each of us have a little of Rachel's ugly, superior attitude in us?"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is an ingenious look at many American's ethnocentric view of the world and insecurity made apparent by the inability to accept differences. When an obsessively rightous father fails to impose his values on a different culture he is unable to adjust and goes insane. Luckily his all-female, dependent family finds their own ways to adjust when is becomes obvious that they must to survive. Ms.Kingsolver seems to have a political and religious ax to grind, although she does balance the renegade &quot;Baptist's&quot; dogma with a Jesuit priest who understands the locals. It saves the book from making a complete mockery of Christianity. It will be interesting to contrast the comments at the Episcopal Church's book club in July with my mostly Jewish bookclub discussion next winter."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book was a major disappointment to me. The first hundred pages were slow and hard for me to get into. It got more interesting around the middle but ended horribly with boring, trite, and preachy politics along with a lot of guilt. The historical background on the African Congo was a good history lesson for me, but not enough of a reason to suffer through it. Yawn."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver brings her typical finely-honed writing to Poisonwood, along with humor and her social conscience all in one. Even if you don't agree with everything she says, you have to love how she says it. Five hundred years from now Kingsolver will still be read, and, I'm guessing, best-known for The Poisonwood Bible."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Not since I listened to Angela's Ashes narrated by its author have I felt that the audio version was superior to that of the written. This is an audiobook that made me want to do long errands in my car, or take longer walks with my walkman just to have more time listening to this beautiful book. The narrator's subtle changes in the soft Georgian accents of the characters makes this book a great &quot;listen&quot;. Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Once again Barbara Kingsolver shrugs off conventional storytelling to refresh the reader with an original plot. I loved the mystery that runs throughout the book. Barbara, keep writing!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This historical novel was compelling and alive in its portrayal of the depiction of Africa during the 1950's. While remembering alot of the historical points, I also could relate to the growing pains exhibited by the children.I truly enjoyed reading this novel and would highly recommend this book to anyone who grew up in the 50's"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is a masterpiece. Written with verve and yet cynicism this is a great book. It teaches much about Africa, missionary life, and the dilemma of Chritianization of Third World people in light of the colonial experience. This is also a book about dysfuntional families, tragedies, and triumphs. Some of the passages were so power and overwhelming that I had to put the book down. It has been months since I read the book, but I still think about some of those passages. A rare achievement"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I loved getting the feel of the land and the native people and walked away with a feeling of almost having been there. I enjoyed getting the true history from the point of view of someone there rather than all the propaganda in the news or the circled rumors of many so-called historians. For these things, I am glad I read the book, but over all I walked away feeling cheated and betrayed as the reader. I could have gotten the above from a well written journal.I found Kingsolver's continual jumping from from 5 first person points of view interesting, but not reader friendly. Everytime I took a break from reading I had to back track to see who was talking. I also found wallowing in feminine self righteousness, martyrdom and self pity, tedious and stereo typical, but I stuck with Kingsolver expecting to be rewarded for my loyalty. Finally, I got an exciting climax and the escape of the women from the tyranical father (whose point of view is never offered us.) The boys got the girls and the girl got the mom and everything was ripe for a nice epilogue and a rounding off of all interwoven themes. Kingsolver gave me my reward for readership and then she brazenly took it back and proceeded to punish me.I would have rated this much higher if she would not have contiued on to write over 140 pages of never ending epilogues. I trudged through chapter after chapter of repetitious martyrdom superimposed over the history and effect of the politics. All could have been summed up accurately in a few pages. Instead I came away feeling that the tryst between author and reader had been violated."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"'The Poisonwood Bible' by Barbara Kingsolver. I just could not get into it at all. I found it boring and could not finish it.

It is told from the perspective of the mother and her four daughters and I looked forward to reading each of their accounts."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Some books are amazing, some are horrible, the vast majority are simply mediocre. The Poisonwood Bible, by Barbara Kingsolver, however, seems to be one of those rare books where skill and research should make it amazing, but it somehow misses the mark.Starting in 1959, The Poisonwood Bible follows the Price family, Southern Baptists from Georgia, as they move to (what at the time is) the Belgian Congo as missionaries. From the beginning there is contention, it becoming clear that the father, Nathan Price, has strong handed his way into the post, dragging his less than enthusiastic wife, Orleanna, and four daughters--Rachel, Leah, Adah, and Ruth May--along for the ride. Following the five Price women, the book switches in between Orleanna, Rachel, Leah, Adah, and Ruth May's viewpoints painting a clear picture of a dysfunctional family threatened to be torn apart by such a drastic change to their lives.From the beginning, it is clear Kingsolver is a skilled writer. Switching between the five characters seemingly without a set pattern, each viewpoint is fully developed, five distinct voices rising out from five fully-developed characters. While each woman seems simple in many ways to define--vain Rachel, playful Ruth May, dutiful Orleanna--they are in no way defined by a singular characteristic that far too often leads to flat stock characters. Within moments, it is possible to believe that these are real characters sharing a story with you, not an author trying to tell their story.Kingsolver's involved research, and personal experience with the African continent, adds to this all-encompassing immersion into a world that will tend to be as foreign to the reader as it is for the Price women. It's possible to feel the sticky heat of the rainy season in the jungle, feel a mass of giant ants as they move through the small African village. The entire world comes with a level of reality that is much too often lacking in novels. As a whole, it would be hard to call Kingsolver's writing anything but superb.Unfortunately, even with the quality of writing and emotional storyline, The Poisonwood Bible seems to miss its mark in truly leaving an impact. Even with five different, realistic characters giving you their sides of the story, it's hard to connect with any of them. Where most stories telling the story of a group of women allow the reader to connect with at least one or two, none of the characters come off as especially likeable. As well-rounded as they are, it's hard to hate any of them, especially when they all get the chance to explain their sides, but it's equally hard to love any of them. Without a connection to any particular character, it's hard to fully share in their hardship. Where their despair should be the reader's despair, their triumphs the reader's triumphs, it instead leaves a passing interest or feeling of pity, nothing more. This effect is even more pronounced with the characters the reader is obviously supposed to dislike. Again, it doesn't seem possible to feel so strongly as to hate the characters, but their unagreeable personalities leave them simply annoying. Hate would arguably be better.As a whole, The Poisonwood Bible is a cut above the vast majority of novel. It would be difficult to call it mediocre by any stretch. However, lacking an emotional connection to any of the characters, it is difficult to fully take advantage of Kingsolver's brilliant writing and realistic setting. Still, The Poisonwood Bible gives an interesting peak into the lives of a family thrown into turmoil in the Belgian Congo, giving readers an enjoyable, if not amazing, read.Under Creative Commons License: Attribution No DerivativesSource: ePublish a Book"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Dear Publishers,I read this book many years ago, greatly enjoyed it.

Lower the price to match the new paperback and I'd be more inclined to purchase it.Thanks,Paul"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is a nice, clean book. It is a 1st edition, but with the end page cut is loses a lot of value. A good reader, but not a collectible."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I loved The Poisonwood Bible.I grew up in that sort of culture (ultra-fundamentalist Christian, critical of other people's lifestyles and beliefs, and thinking that it is our God-given duty to convert everyone else to our own religion) although my immediate family wasn't in missions. But my aunt's family was, and in the same time frame as the book. My cousins were born in Africa and one of them has been a missionary in Zambia now for over 25 years, for the same church that we grew up in.So I really related to the book and can vouch for its authenticity.Interestingly, my sister hated The Poisonwood Bible. She said that, for her, it brought back too many bad memories. I said that it educates people about what some (many?) religious missions are like. Her reply was that most readers think that the extreme belief system portrayed in the book is a fictional invention of Kingsolver's; and that only a few people like us, who have experienced it for themselves, realize that missions like that really do exist.This is typical of the responses I've seen to this book: two very well-read people with exactly the same background, but with two opposite opinions. A book that inspires this kind of discussion is undeniably thought-provoking and mentally stimulating."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I do heartily recommend this book. I am un-phased by other reviewers calling this book anti-christian or anti-american. It may be both, but it is well written and is good critique of a lot of bad. I am American and Christian and can handle some criticism when it is thoughtful and well placed. I think this qualifies on both counts.But I would say that Kingsolver becomes less interesting of a writer as she goes a long. The first 4 sections of her book are phenomenal and the charcters interesting. However the last section of her book feels rushed and the charcters feel like they've been flattened out. I liked this book because there was so much color in the charcters. It kept me reading. Towards the end, I kept reading just to finish. The life was gone.But hey...this is my opinion and I can be a little critical. I think it's a good read...so hey go ahead."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"So I've finally gotten around to reading and finishing The Poisonwood Bible. This has been on my list for quite a long time, and I'm glad I read it. Told through the stories of the mother and 4 daughters, the first two-thirds of the book detail the struggles of a missionary family in the Congo in the 1960's while the last third reveals just how much the Congo had transformed each of them.How can anyone really hope to return to a \\"normal\\" life in America after seeing and living in such poverty - where death was a way of life and you had to struggle for mere survival. Faced with malaria and ravenous ants, the Price girls each bring a unique experience to their tale of the Congo. None of them leave quite as they came, and yet their basic personalities remain the same.Rachel was the popular platinum-blond teenager back \\"home\\" in Georgia. I really liked this character the least, and you get the feeling that Kingsolver didn't like her that much either. She wasn't the brightest bulb, but she knew how to take care of herself, and that's what she focused on during the whole of the book. At times, her chapters were just annoying though, with her malapropisms and complaining.I particularly enjoyed hearing about life through the eyes of Adah, the mal-formed twin with an uncanny ability to see the symmetry in things. She loved palindromes and poetry, and she had an irreverent wit about her that made her narrative intriguing. With her gift for language, she often mused about the dual meanings of words in the Congolese village of Kilanga, and she saw life and death dancing with each other in a precarious balance.Leah, Adah's twin, was another character I found I could relate to. During her early days in the jungle, she found herself doing what she could to gain the approval and attention of her father, Nathan. I really couldn't understand the character of Nathan. He was a man driven mad with his goal of changing Africa to his ways. He tried to force the Congo into something it was not, and he could not accept failure. This stubbornness spelled out disaster for his family, especially during the politcal tumult of the Congo's first elections and governmental upheaval. I'm sure that I'll never understand the religious zealot's refusal to bend and compromise, or even leave when it was clearly dangerous to remain. Without taking the time to know those in his village, how could he hope to change their underlying beliefs and superstitions?I guess I'm surprised by the fact that the women stayed in the same household with him as long as they did, but I cheered for them when they marched out of there. Orleanna, the wife, was probably the most poignant character of the book. Her sections are always distant reflections of what happened, and your heart just breaks listening to her tell the story of her own destruction through her marriage to Nathan and her unbreakable tie to Africa.This really is a book worth reading. Kingsolver has done her homework on the history and lives of those in the Congo and gives life to the tiny village of Kilanga. I found the two missionaries, Nathan Price and Fyntan Fowles were amazing contrast. While one refused to adapt the Christian message to the Congo, the other took the traditions of the Congo and told the message of Christianity through those traditions. It's not surprising that one succeeded and thrived in Africa while the Congo destroyed the other.Anyway, enough random ramblings. Read the book. It's good."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book was on my AP English summer reading list, and I have to admit that at first, the idea of reading a 500+ page book during my vacation wasn't very appealing. However, if I had known that this book was going to be as remarkable as it is, I would have read it a long time ago. As a student who tends to stay within the realm of the classics when choosing books to read, I enjoyed this more recent book immensely, and while I had never read one of Kingsolver's books previous to this one, I found her writing style to be quite intriguing. While it is a work of fiction, The Poisonwood Bible is so well grounded with a historical setting that the plot itself was very believable. The characters are so well developed that by the end of the book, I felt that I knew them personally, and since the book takes place over a period of more than forty years, I enjoyed getting to know them and seeing how they changed throughout the story. This book is amazing in every aspect and has a very poignant message about our ability to impact those around us and our inability to let go of our past. I couldn't put it down and you won't be able to either. Prepare to be haunted by a future literary classic!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Beautifully, beautifully written; Kingsolver's crisp, poetic imagery and fluid language create a lush and present enviornment for a complex, deeply disturbing story. I was fascinated by how well Kingsolver navigated layers of psychological/family dynamics in this book-- narrating from several differing perspectives. An incredibly realistic account, psychologically speaking, of the haunting emotional devastation wreaked upon a family given a father's narcissistic investment in his own views --and a mother's passivity. Kingsolver brings beautiful and desolate Africa to the reader, both in landscape and politics, and strengthens awareness of political and sociological issues present in patriarchal culture, social class, and religion. This book had me turning one page after another, unable to set it down. When finished, I spent a long time discussing it over coffee; I was so moved by the book, as well as energized by Kingsolver's creative ability and insight. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood bible is the story of one family's struggleswith eachother and Africa. The father, a zealous Pastor feels he mustconvert the African people of the Congo to Christianity. The familyendures the struggles of famine, starvation, lonliness, and death, allin the name of Jesus Christ. Kingsolver does an excellent job withdeveloping her characters. Adah, one of the four daughters, isblessed with the mind of a genius, but no one knows it because of hersilence. She is independant and strong. She adapts the best in theCongo. The story follows [their] lives ... even after they leave thecongo and its hardships. The story is not so much about their livesin the congo as it is about how that life affected them. It wasincredibly written and very moving. The reader develops relationshipswith the characters. The reader can be moved and entertained at thesame time. The Poisonwood bible is definitly worth reading."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver is a gifted prose writer with an unfortunate penchant for didacticism-- in the service of a multicultural agenda that I generally support, but which I find weakens her artistic achievement. A casual inspection of her work from, say, ANIMAL DREAMS to the present book suggests that she's becoming ever more polemical, ever more like Price in this novel, the fanatical preacher she so despises, only on the opposite end of the political spectrum. This increasing politicization is probably what attracted Oprah's cadre of self-appointed pundits, who, in their well-meaning effort to instruct the masses in literary taste, seem to have forgotten that the greatest literature has always been written in the service of truths far subtler than those black and white ones on which politics has purchase. If Oprah really wants to raise the bar of popular opinion, this is what she needs to lead her audience to see."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I greatly enjoyed this book. I couldn't put it down. Kingsolver does a great job of tying you into the book in the first 30 pages that you have no choice but to continue. All of the characters are so real, and the style of the book (being told by the 5 women from their points of view) is excellent. I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The developement of the characters over a span of forty plus years is an accomplishement in itself. Then add to it her research of this era, and this incredible novel takes you away. It was fun and fascinating. I enjoyed immensley the way each character had a distict voice.I did not give her five stars because there were a few sections that felt like words were used to simply make the book longer--where four or five sentences would have worked, eight or ten paragraphs were constructed.Overall, I really enjoyed the book, appreciated the immense effort to assemble such a story, and am grateful for her contribution to literature."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Few novels moved me so much as this book did. I cried and laughed, laughed and cried for this vivid epic. Set in a far obscure Congo village Kilango about 40 years ago, this story read so vivid and true. I wept for all six protagonists, for their fate and adherence. Especially Adah and Leah. Kingsolver's power of describing the inner conflict of gifted children was incomparable. Every so-called gifted educationist should scrutnize the life story and the way of thinking of Leah and Adah (although this twin were mere fictional!)In my viewpoints the best part of this epic lay on the first two-thirds. With weaving scenes, african aroma, gorgeous language witty, and different viewpoints,those chapters shone with bright sparkle. Almost every section made me gasp. While from their Exodus this splendid sound seemed fade a little. The pace and rhythm was too fast. After all,to tell 25 years of stories of 3 different women in less 100 pages was not a easy task. Often I found myself forgot &quot;how old are Leah(or any other) now&quot;,and I must calculate once more. That's because the previous adolescent images of these girls stamped on the reader so deep and firm, they were too vivid to grow up. And sometimes I feel a bit annoying there were too much polictical preachment in these pages. But on the last 50 pages the splendid and gorgeous flame flamed again. The close sections were very beautiful and moving.This is truly a remarkable fiction. Wholeheartedly recommended."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I have read most everything that Kingsolver has written and even got to see her in person and hear her lecture. She is a fascinating woman and I found her very real and enjoyable. I loved the first 2/3 of the Poisonwood Bible. I found the interaction of the family with the native peoples of the Congo compelling to read, and Kingsolver's descriptions were, as expected, very enlightening. I was disappointed in the ending of the book, however. I thought she could have given her characters more ability to rise above the trauma they had experienced in the Congo, make their way back to a meaningful return to modern life, and benefit from the experience rather than being so permanently scarred by it. I felt the characters ended the story long before Kingsolver did.I am once again sorry to see so many reviews published from magazine and newspaper editors that see each book as the author's best work and appear to be selling the book to their readers. The Poisonwood Bible, in my opinion, is definitely not Kingsolver's best work to date. I have found Kingsolver's other books to be fascinating and great reads but this one was way too long and the characters got buried in their struggles. Nonetheless, I will continue to read any short stories that she writes, since in these books she shines."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"What a richly shared tale of love and dysfunction, politics and spirit. At night I savored each character's &quot;journal&quot; entry, getting to know them, becoming familiar with an unfamiliar world until I was traveling alongside. In the end, I'm left with plenty to ponder, and better for the trip."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book is so fascinating I can't put it down. It's been well researched as one can see from the bibliography at the end, and I feel I'm learning so much about one African country's tragic history, something they never told us about in school. I like one reader's comparison to the Mosquito Coast; the family power structure is very similar, as well as the white Americans' naivete and total unpreparedness for what they find.I'm almost at the end and find I dont want to let it go either. The characters (except for the father) have done so much growing throughout, and the plot never lacks for action. On a scale of 1-5, I'd give this a 6."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"A fan of Barbar Kingsolver, I was on the waiting list at the library before this book even came out. I didn't find it nearly as enjoyable as her previous novels. As a Kingsolver book, it wasn't that good. As a book, however, I found it superior.Readers may have trouble reading Ada's palandrome-laden narratives, or sympathizing with Rachel, the beauty queen. THat was something I wasn't used to. Generally, all of Kingsolvers characters are slightly flawed, but likeable. This was the first book of hers I read where I genuinely disliked some of the characters.Still, it was good, but not up to my expectations."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"When I saw it in the book store, I decided that I had to buy it, even though it had not come out in paperback (not a grad student anymore). I've loved Ms. Kingsolver's lyrical descriptions, wonderful ways of showing the love of native people of the southwest and how her characters deal with community. I believe all she wrote about the political situation, the family of fundamentalist missionaries, the naivety, etc. A bit predictable from my point of view (mainline denomination pastor). She is indeed a great visionary. But I missed the small moments of love that enchanted me in Pigs in Heaven, Animal Dreams, and The Bean Trees, the ways that folk do redeem their lives with love. I guess I felt this didn't have the same measure. Yes, there is a romance, but this one left me untouched, and I'm not sure why. Do read it, but don't expect the same Kingsolver."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"As a fan of Kingsolver, I was a little disappointed at first when the book did not seem to follow her usual pattern. But, I was soon swept up in the story and the characters and the emotions of the book. I rarely cry or laugh when reading. I did both with this book. It is tremendous."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Poisonwood Bible is such a responsible book in keeping with environmental, political, and human issues. The characters really hold your interest and you are pulled into the story from the first. I always enjoy Kingsolver's work and this may be the best one yet."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver has deliverd on her most ambitious effort so far. Poisonwood Bible demonstrates Kingsolver's mastery of the narrative in the finest traditions of Louisa May Alcott and Little Women. Her sparse prose reveals her background as both a technical writer and reporter and is reminiscent of Hemingway's style of writing. As good as the Poisonwood Bible is, Kingsolver's best work has yet to be written. This narrative of four sisters and their mother adapting to life in the Beligan Congo of 1959 deserves more attention then will it will no doubt receive from the more traditional literati."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I've always regarded Kingsolver as a good -- not great -- writer. I enjoy her books, but have never placed them on the shelf aside Beloved, Gatsby, Catch-22, The All of It, etc. This book, though, belongs on that shelf. In this, Kingsolver's greatest strength, her ability to draw characters so clear and interesting that the reader feels a sense of loss at the book's end, is at its zenith. The family who goes to Africa on the father's mission to save Africa is comprised of a superficial beauty, an introspective, angry genius, a guilty girl, and insightful child, an Eisenhower-era perfect mom, and a monomaniacal father. Together, they face incredible ignorance (their own), pestilence (straight from the old testament), racism, intolerance, social upheaval and a slow awakening of political understanding. The first 2/3 of the book are fabulous, the &quot;stuff&quot; of National Book Awards, Pulitzers, Nobels...The last 1/3 drags a bit...I think Kingsolver has problems in ending books because she likes her characters so much that she has trouble letting them go. This is fabulous, though. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Coming right out with it, I'll admit Kingsolver is a favourite of mine, and so I bought this book pre-publication. Her novels are good, her essays are fantastic, and the quality of her work would hold you if she were writing recipes.I am disappointed in Poisowood Bible, however; the characters are one-dimensional, the storyline awfully predictable, and the explanation of Africa's problems as spouted by one of the characters is breathtakingly simplistic.That said, this book kept my husband reading when he picked it off the shelf by mistake (his general taste runs more to Wilbur Smith!); although I don't think it is her best work, I will definitely wait for Kingsolver's next book just as anxiously as this one, as she can weave words and emotions and occurrences together in a fantastic web between two covers, no matter what the subject!Pat Chapin"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kingsolver does the world an important service by putting politics right out there in this novel, but it does not compromise the beauty and power of her story."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"When I picked this book up at the bookstore, I wasn't all that enthused about it, but it was for my book club. Almost as soon as I started it I was taken with the author's unique and expressive powers of description. I grew up in the Middle East, and I have travelled through Africa. The descriptions of the jungle, the people, the climate....everything....made me feel like I was sitting right there with the Price family. The story of 4 daughters and their mother, all at the mercy of a deeply disturbed man whose psychoses are cloaked by wild-eyed religious zeal, haunted me and stayed with me long after I read the last page. I felt a surge of nostalgia when reading about how woefully unprepared the family was for life deep in the Congo. The story is written from the point of view of each daughter and the mother. How the author managed to keep it all straight in her head well enough to get it down on paper is beyond me. The story doesn't have a particularly happy ending; even so it is a wonderful book and well worth the time it takes to read it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is the first book I have read by Barbara Kingsolver and, like many other readers, became an immediate fan. I love to read books that take me places where I've never been before and probably will never get to in my lifetime. In Poisonwood Bible, the location is the Belgian Congo and is set in a time when the people of the Congo are seeking independence from Belgium. The novel covers a span of almost 40 years following each of the characters' lives, thoughts, up and downs, and finally their discovery of self and their strengths.Nathan Price, a missionary, has been sent to convert the heathens in the Congo and brings his wife and four daughters along on his mission. They move from Georgia to the Congo and the scene in which they are packing what they'll need while there is nothing short of a comedic routine. Just picture leaving &quot;junior league&quot; Georgia -- destination &quot;the jungle&quot;. I keep remembering the scene where they are told to pack very little so they decide to layer their clothing in order to be able to bring more attire than they could fit in their suitcases. One of the daughters is layered about 5 deep so you can just imagine how hot she is upon her arrival in the Congo.Kingsolver's descriptions of the heat, destitution, disease, insects and overall political unrest are unparalleled. The plight of the mother Oleanna and her four daughters is told through their own voices chapter by chapter. This is a writing style that I particularly enjoy. Since no voice is given to the father, the reader is left to dislike him intensely as he is protrayed as a religious fanatic as well as a domineering and tyranical husband. The correlation between the African slaves and the obedient wife who becomes a slave to her callous husband's idealogies is duly noted.There is so much depth to this book that you will find yourself writing down quotes from the book from time to time. While it's sometimes hard to keep a reader's interest going in a book of this magnitude, Kingsolver does it masterfully. Having known nothing of the author prior to this reading, it was obvious throughout that she was making a political statement. I was glad that my eyes were opened to the travesty that exists in this other part of the world. If I have one complaint about the book, it is in the author's note where she is acknowledging individuals for their help and refers to Mumia-Abu-Jamal and states &quot;he read and commented on the manuscript from prison; I'm grateful for his intelligence and courage.&quot; She obviously didn't add that he is on death row, convicted of killing a Philadelphia policeman some years ago. This one sentence clouded my ultimate enjoyment of the book before it even started as I can picture the widow and children that this cop left behind. Politics aside, it is a masterful work by a talented and gifted author."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Engrossing, to say the least. Kingsolver does an excellent job of differentating between the 5 narrators' voices. Many readers might be tempted to avoid the multiple narrator device in this novel. Kingsolver almost strains to make sure that the five voices are indeed different, and they are, leading the reader to understand the wonderful complexities of the characters, without which this story could seem somewhat pedestrian. All readers will like some of the narrator/characters better than others and look forward to the next chapter they narrate --only natural-- as well as occasionally wishing that X character wasn't narrating again so soon. The three surviving daughers complement each other wonderfully; their points of view are believable and necessary to give at least three versions of Africa. The politics don't grate; indeed the political background might even have been developed a little more. Kingsolver is fortunately not longwinded in her descriptions and the 543 pp. are necessary to tell her story well. The last chapter is particularly well done. I bought this on the strength of its generally good reviews in the press and believe that the author's work certainly lives up to them."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Ambitious and timely, well-written and fully realized, The Poisonwood Bible deserves to be lauded from every quarter.I disagree totally with all the critisicm against Rachel's malapropisms. Believe it or not, this is the way young people, who are basically bright but too lazy to read, wind up speaking. Extremely shallow and self-absorbed, Rachel takes in the word superficially and verbalizes back in the same way. It is totally realistic and sometimes her malapropisms are more on-the-mark than the original saying.All four females were compelling characters and the scope of the novel was just awe-inspiring.I'm giving my teenaged daughter this book to read in order to further teach her the lessons of tolerance, respect and thankfulness.I've enjoyed Ms. Kingsolver's work in the past, but this book has surpassed everything else. I can't wait for her next one."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I read this book with my reading group, and after reading all the reviews I am wondering what we missed. Of the 10 in the group only 3 managed to finish. 5 read the first couple of chapters and never went beyond, and the last two quit about half way. I finished the book, but I found it overlong. It was extremely slow moving and frequently boring. I never cared very much about any of the characters with the exception of Adah, and it seemd as if the political agenda of the author frequently overwhelmed the storytelling. Not one I would be inclined to recommend or ever read again."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"First of all, PW is a decent story, and Kingsolver does a decent job as she usually does.The problem begins and ends with its overt didactic tone. It takes a chapter or two to despise the father, and the reader is certainly justified in feeling such hate. PW preaches the troubles of placing ideology above self-preservation. Kingsolver does her best to truly impress upon the reader why the father is worthy of derision. She &quot;teaches&quot; this well.She then leaves us with one daughter that is hero-ized for her decision to fight the good fight in Africa. Seemingly, the lesson of derision is supposed to be ignored as the reader glorifies Leah's decision. She, however, has stepped right into her father's footsteps, and she endangers her family in the same vicious way that her father endangered her own childhood experience. This would actually work really well, if Kingsolver maintained or redeveloped in the reader a sense of disgust for the character.Instead, Kingsolver strides into the preacher mode and pushes a socialist agenda in as strong a fashion as Updike does in _The Jungle_."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver is a brilliant writer, no question, and &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; is her crowning achievment to date, although it goes on a bit too long for its own good. Kingsolver deftly alternates among five points of view: the wife and four daughters of an over-zealous, fanatical minister who find themselves dragged to the Belgian Congo as it teeters on the brink of war. Their voices are distinct and their experiences paint a panorama of dramas played out in a foreign world where their pasts have not prepared them for what's to come. The book is at its best during the first three quarters of the story as a terrible tragedy serves as the last straw for mother and daughters. Its during the book's final chapters that it loses steam. The girls grow up and the mother finds a new life back in the U.S., abandoning father and husband to the jungle he's determined to drag into the light of Christianity. Suddenly this engaging novel becomes a politcal manifesto of sorts, and it's quite obvious Kingsolver is using her characters as mouthpieces for her strong yet very valid personal views. I found it hard to believe these girls would grow into these women. Still, the final chapter is poetic and brilliantly written. This is well worth a read, even the political passages which are beautifully written. &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; is an important book, and Kingsolver a great author."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Probably the best book I have ever read. I will reread it in the future which I very seldom ever do. Being from a minister's family, I know the drama that goes on behind the scenes of that life and Ms. Kingsolver captured the heart and soul of the Father obsessed in his beliefs and the Mother/children caught in the middle. Thank you for such an outstanding novel. Hope there will be more books to come from this author."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book was everything you could ask for in a great epic! There are a million reasons why I loved this book but above all, I loved the way Kingsolver used language. She clearly has written a novel that takes you by the hand and leads you to places you never thought you'd be. The characters are unique but at the same time I felt like I knew people just like these fictional characters which is a sign of a well written novel. This is a MUST READ for anyone who appreciates masterful writing and an adventure. I learned things from reading this book and have a new understanding of the Congo because of that. 5 Stars!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Rich imagery, leafy, green and lush. I've never been to Africa but feel like I've experienced life in the Congo - the colorful clothing, the manioc fields, the unrelenting rainy seasons, a society where you give what you can to your neighbors, where deformities and scars are seen as beauty marks. The novel is not without it's flaws, as the other readers have pointed out, but if you're in the mood for something different, I reccomend THE POISONWOOD BIBLE. The struggle this family had to endure as outsiders in deepest, darkest Africa was a truly engrossing story, and the different perspectives of each of the daughters and their mother made it that much more captivating. I felt as if I really got to know them and wanted to know what happened to them, which is why I'm glad the book didn't end when they left the Congo."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"WHY DOES THIS BOOOK ONLY RATE 4 STARS? IT'S MOST CERTAINLY A FIVE STAR READ.I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN. AS A WOMAN OF A CERTAIN AGE THIS ERA IS SO FAMILIAR TO ME, ALTHOUGH AFRICA, SADLY WAS NOT. THE AUTHOR BRINGS NOT ONLY THE CONGO TO LIFE BUT THE LIVES OF ALL THE WOMEN INVOLVED. THE ENDING COULDN'T HAVE BEEN BETTERED. I'M SENDING THE AUDIOCASSETTE TO MY 91 YEAR OLD MOTHER WHOM I KNOW WILL BE AS ENTHUSED AS I AM. NEEDLESS TO SAY I'VE RECOMMENDED IT TO ALL MY FRIENDS."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I found this book to be entertaining and educational. I marveled at the way the author told the story of a missionary family's foray to the Belgian Congo through the eyes of a mother and her four daughters. The book was a wonderful primer on the Congo and the events that occurred during it's struggle for independence. I found myself wanting to read more and more of the book - not only to find out what happened to the wonderful characters, but also to find what would happen to the country itself.A great vacation read! You'll be thinking about the characters and the events in this book for a long time after you've finished reading about them."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"You know you are reading a good book when you stay up way too late at night, you take the book with you to the gym, to the cafe, and even to the bathroom because YOU JUST CAN'T PUT IT DOWN. I must be honest and say that I am only half way through this book but so far, it is just wonderful. Her characters are well developed, tragic and funny, emotionally deep and remarkably flippant - just like real people in real life. I first found myself astonished and then angry at the father's arrogance and insularity but now, as I progress through the story, I find myself pitying him most of all, his loneliness and pride, and his complete lack of comprehension of how he should approach his role as a white, foreign missionary. Go get this book as soon as you can and read it - it is a wonderful study on human personalities, quirks, strengths and weaknesses and how all of them collide within the family (not to mention a great introductory education about the Congo and 20th century Euro-American policy and attitudes toward African countries)."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Has anyone noticed that the five women - the mother, the adolescent beauty queen, the intelligent tomboy, the bitter cripple, and the little girl - are parts of a whole - the various &quot;characters&quot; that make up a woman's psyche? Their perceptions, taken together, make up a full picture of their situation; taken separately, they are hopelessly slanted and biased. This is one of the factors that makes this novel so universal in its appeal; whether you're interested in the Congo or not, it has interesting psychological overtones."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Because I lived in Zaire/the Congo for five years and wasrecently back for a visit, and because I loved Kingsolver's earlierworks, I was eagerly awaiting this new novel as soon as I found out what topic Kingsolver had chosen. All of her formidable strengths are evident: her characters, her sense of language, the grace that characters meet even in the midst of deep troubles. In addition, she shows Africa as it is. Even though I lived there from 1979-1984, the villages are much the same as they were in 1959, and Kingsolver shows them. She captures, too, the ambivalent feelings of the Congolese for Americans: admiration and gratitude on one hand, distrust and bitterness on the other. And her information on the political scene is unfortunately quite accurate. A must read, on many levels, for many reasons!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"There were two preachers in this book, the fictional missionary one and the author. The first part of the book was great, beautifully written and a fascinating account of life in the Congo. However, Kingsolver's agenda eventually murdered the story, turning the characters into cartoons and relentlessly hammering the reader with her message. She should have ended the novel sooner, then gotten her social justice sermon off her chest with an essay."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I enjoyed Kingsolver's \\"The Poisonwood Bible.\\" She is a good writer. Not a GREAT writer, but good. She is able to tell a story and make you feel the characters' pain. I personally do not know who was more insane - the father for taking his family to Africa without proper sponsorship or adequate preparation, or the mother for going with him, with her children. He was a seriously ill and abusive man, the last man to be ministering to an indigenous people, when he was incapable of ministering to his own family. Perhaps like other dysfunctional couples, they thought the sacrifice for a higher cause, along with a change of scene, would save them. My main criticism is that I wish that Kingsolver had shown more examples of organized, capable and dynamic missionaries who helped to build Christian communities all over the African continent which survive to this day. Otherwise, one gets the impression that most missionaries are incompetent. I think the main point of this novel is that a woman who is nonassertive in the face of a situation which endangers her children is just plain weak and foolish. It has nothing to do with Christian obedience and everything to do with codependence. An enjoyable if very sad book which I recommend."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is one of the few books all the ladies in my family has cherished -- my husband has yet to read it, so I can't say it's an all around family favorite.Kingsolver has and a rich appreciation for the environment which comes thru in every novel or essay she writes. Her use of language is delicious and her descriptions transport you to Africa, Nicaragua, the Mid-west, Southwest, or wherever she happens to be writing about.Poisonwood Bible is the first of Ms. Kingsolvers books I've read. I have two criticisms of her writing, so let me get them out of the way, and then everything else is praise. Firstly, her male characters are not as fully developed as her female characters. The father in this novel is so one-dimensional that everyone I've spoken to thinks the same thing about him. How trite. There have to be little snippets of worthiness in most people that can generate great arguments.Secondly, she has been criticized for her underdeveloped male characters and basically has said that since she's a woman, she understands females better. That's not good enough and way too glib for me. That said, let the praise begin.Kingsolver's background is as a botanist, and the descriptions she weaves of flora and fauna are luxurious and move her stories beautfully along. She develops her characters with love and grace. When tragedy befalls anyone, it seems necessary to her plots, and never gratuitious (for which I am etermnally grateful, being a squeamish soul myself).I can't remember ever seeing a curse word in any of her writing. Her love scenes actually seem to make feel awkward, so they are brief, and hilariously so.You leave her writing feeling more compassion and love for the earth and for people from areas we don't frequently pay much attention to in the West.My middle daughter is going to Mozambique to do volunteer work for a year and a half. She read Poisonwood Bible while in Nicaragua several years ago helping to build low income housing. (Nica is another country Kingsolver has written about sympathetically.) I'd bet the intrigue of Poisonwood Bible helped plant the seeds in my daughter to do more volunteer work than for a week or so a year.Sorry for my digressions. I just loved this book, and its author. She is so passionate about so much it just carries over.If I knew you, I'd give you a money back guarantee on this book!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I read The Poisonwood Bible knowing that it was a hippie touchstone, the staple of hairy-armpitted Fair Trade obsessives who eschew deodourant and will admit, if pushed, that they think Marx will eventually be proved right. As such, I was well prepared to hate the book. Sadly, I couldn't.It's beautifully written, evocative and painful. Whether one respects the underlying politics or not, it's very difficult not to invest emotional capital with the characters, and to be moved. The pacing of the story is unusual: it departs from normal narrative rhythm and keeps the reader off-balance. The use of language is calculated and effective, funny and clever.I think this is an excellent novel, damn it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is a wonderful story about how four daughters deal with moving to the congo, and deal with their father who believes in nothing but the baptism of all those within the world. Barbara Kingsolver does a masterful job of seeing through eyes of Ruth May, Rachel, Leah, Adah, and Orleanna Price as they deal with moving to a different continent and different culture as Nathan Price tries to convert all the Congo to christianity. The author really does a brilliant job going into the differnt minds of the charecters. It was interesting to see how different people reacted differently to different events that occured. I've never read a book like this before, i hope to run accross another brilliant work like this soon."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"In \\"The Poisonwood Bible,\\" Barbara Kingsolver executes satisfactorily the essential elements of a provocative story: satisfying character development, suspense, and attention to detail. The four daughters in her story, Rachel, Leah, Adah, and Ruth May, have distinct voices and successfully serve as foils and mirrors against each other. All of them reflect pieces that can be found in many of us.Rachel is the unabashed American, representative of American culture at its worst and most self-absorbed. Because Kingsolver portrays her with such compassionate humor, Rachel allows us to see ourselves in her, without the need to put up our defenses and shun that aspect of ourselves that resides in many of us. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross in her autobiography, \\"The Wheel of Life,\\" writes of her realization at the end of World War II that \\"there is a Hitler in all of us.\\" So, too, is there the potential for a Rachel in all of us, as Kingsolver illustrates in her contemporary journey into Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness.\\"In contrast, it is pure joy and discovery to watch Leah develop over the course of the novel. Indeed, all of the daughters develop, deepen, and mature over time. Their experience in Africa changes their lives, as it hopefully will yours, too, when you read this novel. \\"Love changes everything,\\" says the voice of Leah. Indeed, it does; her love for Africa lost, as well as Kingsolver's, changes everything. You cannot escape this novel without having gained a greater compassion for the tragedy that is Africa, the richness that has been exploited. Yet this is not a sentimental, nave, or simplistic, knee-jerk-liberal perspective of Africa. Kingsolver's portrait is rich in complexity and depth. It is through the different characters' eyes that the complexity of Africa and its history are revealed. In particular, Leah's return to America, when she stands inside a supermarket and experiences wonderment, anger, and shame, should resonate with anyone who has lived outside the US, as it certainly did with me.Adah, too, develops in a surprisingly revealing way. Adah, physically injured at birth and emotionally injured growing up in the United States, illustrates with perfect clarity our culture's discomfort with differences. In Africa, however, her physical \\"abnormality\\" fits right in, and it is her \\"perfect\\" sisters who stand in stark contrast to the maimed natives for whom no modern medical care is available. How Adah resolves and makes peace with her physical and emotional situations is one of the most satisfying discoveries revealed in the novel. Adah is tempted with the opportunity for romance, once she discovers that she is healed. When she discovers, however, that it is only her healed, perfect self that is acceptable to her potential lover, rather than her imperfect self, she rejects the opportunity to thus deny this very real part of herself. So, too, will Africa be acceptable and righted to us, only when it \\"cleans up its act\\" and behaves in a \\"civilized\\" manner? Or can we accept Africa in its blackness, its stark contrast to our blonde whiteness, with its warts and all, and what it mirrors to us about our own warts?Adah's poetic voice is pure joy and beauty to read. Her poetry reveals the language that resides inside of all of us, if only we listen to it and refuse to be distracted by the sounds of our own voices. By not being able to talk as a child, Adah is permitted to develop a rich, though dark, inner voice. The darkness of her poetry also reveals the deep necessity of relationship among us. Because Adah, like many of us, has no one to discuss with and thereby work through her disturbing inner thoughts-her dark side, like Africa's, is shunned in the \\"Land of General Electric\\"-she does not begin to find resolution until \\"the Exodus,\\" when she is forced to make a positive choice for herself. \\"The Exodus\\" is Adah's turning point, when she ceases to see herself as baggage heaped upon her family, and begins to take responsibility for her own life. So, too, at the time of the Exodus--the Congo's independence--the Congo ceases to be the \\"white man's burden\\" and begins to come into its own.But \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" is not merely a story of compassion for Africa. Expect to be angered when you read this story. Readers familiar with Kingsolver's earlier works will recognize her anger at having been betrayed in her benevolent trust of this country's elected public officials and the arrogance of their actions. This anger over betrayal, as well as the poetic voice revealed in Adah, can be found also in her collection of poetry, \\"Another America.\\"Reading \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" reawakened my curiosity surrounding the circumstances of the death of Dag Hammarskj&ouml;ld, the UN Secretary General who died while assisting independence negotiations in the Congo. I have since begun reading Brian Urquhart's biography, \\"Hammarskjold,\\" as well as Michael Wrong's new book, \\"In the Footsteps of Mr. Kurtz.\\" Both have added more dimension to the continuing story of the Congo."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book is by far the most thought-provoking work of fiction that I have read in 5, maybe 10 years. Do read it!This book is in a different league from Kingsolver's previous books, which are excellent reads themselves. I feel like I'm watching a good novelist develop into a great one. She's not there yet, but she's well on her way. I won't argue with those pointing out the flaws, but I found the flaws just added charm to the gifts contained in this book.BTW Rachel's character is frequently mentioned as a flaw in writing. It was the first to spring to my mind too. But even so I find myself wondering, are there really people like Rachel out there? I'm afraid there are, or at least close enough that she contains a sizable grain of truth!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book is excellent! Kingsolver's best. Yes, it does deal with the sticky issue of missionaries and the one in this book is totally off his trolly! Single minded, selfish and stupid, ..., this chap drags his unsuspecting family of all females out into the jungle to erase the culture of the locals and help them abandon their native ways. Turns out bad for the girls, initially, and really bad for the loony dad. Hurrah!!! Yes, you will learn about Africa's fight to get free from the Belgians..What? you say, Belgians &quot;owned&quot; the Congo? Yes sirree Bob and a bloody fight it was. But it will do you good to know this and along the way you'll have a thrilling ride.

With deceptively simple diary-style entries, tells us what it means to be human in many areas including religion, family, imperialism, gender, youth, sibling rivalry, happiness, tolerance. Perhaps the strongest accomplishment is the way it shows several characters, not just the five narrators, as the center of their own universes while intricately ensnared in each others'. Finished it in two plane flights and am considering a re-read once I have lent it around."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The novel deals with a family in the Congo during the 1950's. While Nathan Price is a hard-driven missionary, his wife and children are all marching to different drummers. This is set against the backdrop of a totally hostile environment; there's revolution brewing in the Congo and the very land itself is toxic to the inexperienced Americans. (...)The story is told through the eyes of the four daughters, ranging in age from 5 to 16. The two middle daughters are twins, one being a girl with disabilities who later turns out to be quite a interesting person, despite or even because of the disabilities. The four voices are each distinct, but they are slightly unbelievable.I couldn't put the book down. The disasters are epic, the problems strange and monumental. The characters are very unusual."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I had heard a lot about Kingsolver and was very disappointed in the first book I read--I don't recall the title but it was one of the 'Turtle' books. I found it boring and too predictable. Other readers encouraged me to try this one and I am very glad that I did. Kingsolver's telling of this tale of a missionary and his family in the Congo is a rich mix of a troubled family (abusive father) and their experiences in a troubled Congo (early 1960's). Having each of the four daughters speak is very effective--with the possible exception of the annoying eldest daughter. Her labored malapropisms get pretty wearing after a while--or perhaps I simply have a difficult time tolerating her selfishness. I find the mother's, Ada's and Leah's voices rich and compelling. The mother's unsentimental account of how/why she came to stay with an abusive husband for so long is believable and real-seeming. And her telling of what brought her husband, Nathan, to that state is believable while not forgiving him for the resulting behavior. I actually listened to an audio version of the book. The reader on my Brilliance version is excellent--particularly in her portrayal of the mother. I am usually able to alternate between listening to NPR and an audio book but I found I didn't want to stop this tape--I was very drawn into the story and the characters."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I must admit I'm not a big fan of &quot;historical&quot; fiction, and I don't think I would have read THE POISONWOOD BIBLE if not for the fact that my husband gave this to me as a Christmas gift.

THE POISONWOOD BIBLE is an epic novel spanning thirty years that tells the story of the Price family, Baptist missionaries who leave their home in Georgia in 1959 and head to the Belgian Congo. The novel is told in the alternating voices of Orelanna Price and her four daughters Rachel, Leah, Adah and Ruth May. This is the first book by Ms. Kingsolver that I've read, and it will certainly not be the last. This is a novel of greath power and depth. Stunning and beautifully written, THE POISONWOOD BIBLE is a piece of fiction that is unforgettable and should not be missed."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible was my introduction to Kingsolver's books. And I must say it helped sell me on her storytelling style... reading the Prodigal Summer sealed the sale. That's a big FOR SURE! I thoroughly enjoyed the epic story spun in The Poisonwood Bible. The characters, topic, and setting were thought provoking. The story taught me much about a lifestyle very foreign to me and mine, even though it was based on fictional folks. This is one of the best, most enjoyable, books I've read in a long, long time."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver has reached the zenith in her mastery or words and storytelling in this riveting book. I am not a big reader, but 500+ pages never moved so fast.Wordsmithing skills aside, I am surprised that some reviewers are turned off by the politics of this book, but then I am not surprised, because so few people in this country are able to acknowledge, let alone willing to attempt to change, the horrible, bloody record of the U.S. (and &quot;civilized&quot; Western powers, generally) in their relations with the rest of the world. (For those with a few remaining doubts, try the two part essay on Henry Kissinger in the February and March issues of Harper's magazine, to learn how one of our revered &quot;elder statesman&quot; is actually a war criminal who, through his deliberate actions, visited untold death and suffering on Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Chile, Cyprus, East Timor....) Those who denigrate the book by saying that Kingsolver &quot;wears her politics on her sleeve&quot; are those who read fiction only to escape reality, as opposed to help understand it. Not only did I find the story fascinating, but Kingsolver's ability to move back and forth between personal politics and intra/international politics was dazzling, offering new insights galore. In particular, her connection of patriarchy as experienced by the women in the family to the U.S./Western militarism that is experienced by equally abused countries the world over should get Kingsolver a Pulitzer, if not a Nobel Peace Prize.One hell of a book, among the best I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The description of this novel brings the reader into the heart of the Congo. You will fall in love with each of the characters and travel with them as the book progresses. This book is a must. It's a fabulous summer reading book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This story will stay with me. I didn't read it to learn about the political state or history of Africa (I would read a factual book for that) so I have no problem with any \\"errors\\" as some do.I would have given the book five stars but for Adah's rather unbelievable \\"cure\\" later in life and how Rachel did bcome so very cliche and one dimensional. Even the most vain and least smart people have more depth (of stupidity, if nothing else) than that. However, I could see how she ended up being the kind of person she was. I do wonder if her hotel really was a brothel and she just couldn't admit it, not even to herself.There are passages that I won't soon forget, the sky blue mouth and throat of the snake. Orleanna saying that while Rome was burning all around all she had was a bucket of water, so she cleaned the floors. There are many sentences like this that captured so much. Anatole stole my heart, just as as stole Leah's, or rather in someways she took his heart. I wanted to scream at Leah to return to the USA, but understood how she belonged in Africa. Nathan's ending was perfect, I would have liked to have learned just a little more in depth account of his later years."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"For some reason this book did not resonate with me. I know that a lot of people gave it higher ratings than I did. Found myself slogging through it and speed reading parts of it. The characters, especially of the women are good but the character of the father seems to me to be a bit of a wooden type we have seen many times before.J.

It was a very easy read and I found it hard to put down. I have a feeling some of what I read in here is going to haunt me in the future. I only want to give it 4 or 4.5 stars because of how depressing I found it to be. It had a sadness that I usually don't like to find in my books. It was slightly gloomy all the way through.My favorite quotes:\\"The death of something living is the price of our own survival, and we pay it again and again. We have no choice. It is the one solemn promise every life on earth in born and bound to keep.\\"\\"Misunderstanding is my cornerstone. It's everyone's, come to think of it. Illusions mistaken for truth are the pavement under our feet. They are what we call civilization.\\"I think the imagery of the poverty in Congo... and then the way it was contrasted with the way it is in America really bothered me. No smells... everything clean and aseptic. Not like real life... but fake. I know the author used this book to get across her own political opinions, but she definitely reached me with them even though I knew what she was trying to do. During different parts of the book I reflected on the lifestyle we lead here and all the stuff I have in my home. I marveled at how easily I rinsed out a cup in my kitchen sink. How wasteful it really was. How lucky I am to have access to clean water and all that I have access to. When you live here, you take it for granted and forget how much of the world doesn't have even a little of what we have. I am sure my thoughts on this just sound trite, but I just wanted to make the point that this book has affected me, and good books do that to a reader.I have a long list of books that have caused me to slightly change the way I view the world (and thus, have slowly changed how I view it completely) and I have a feeling this will prove to be one of them."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"1959 the Belgium CongoNathan Price (missionary) is a self righteous smugChristian preacher so-n-so.

She has the ability to draw her readers into her books in such a fashion that they will believe they are a part of them.The Poisonwood Bible is one of the most powerful books I have read in the last decade. It became an exotic journey for me to travel into an unknown land containing unknown beauty and horror. As in both of the books I have read by her, she draws upon her background in biology so that you will feel as if you are witnessing nature firsthand.The story is not for the faint of heart. It is heart-wrenching at points. Yet it is a story of the strength of the human spirit. As the author of a series of spiritual novels, [...], I especially appreciated this. Any book that can get a person in touch with one's heart and soul is so important in this often divisive and violent world in which we live. This book will definitely do it for you! I highly recommend it.Davis Aujourd'hui, author of \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude\\""},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"For me, the first third of Poisonwood Bible was a little slow. I knew that the unrest in the Congo of the 50's and early 60's was the backdrop, but nothing seemed to happen for the longest time.The suspense and the action began to build in the middle of the book and the final section was absolutely fascinating for me.While I am not certain I can totally agree with political or the religious positions taken by the author, I found her attitude toward the influence on children, by parents, culture, and physical environment to be very insightful. Particularly her feelings regarding the safety of one's children and the grief of losing a child.In fact, her description of how Orleanna Price deals with her grief is one of the most profoundly evocative I have ever read ... as long as you keep moving, your grief streams out behind you like a swimmer's long hair in the water. You know it's there, you can feel the weight, but it stays behind you and doesn't entangle you unless you stop long enough to think about it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"It is easy, in the (politically) post colonial world of modern Africa to descend into limp wristed European angst.This book teeters on that edge.It is a book written for colonials and the colonialists.It has very little to say to those of us whose birthright is Africa, of whatever colour, creed, nationality (or tribe).It charts that moment in time when direct political subjugation was replaced by economic subjugation through local proxies.Alas, this is a human tendency that has persisted through all of the history of humanity.It uses the brief period in the history of Zaire (then Congo) immediately prior to, then after the death of Patrice Lumumba and the dictatorship that followed as the locus for it's message. Thereafter it rambles on to the ends of days of it's narrators.What I liked about this book outweighs my dislikes, so here are some of them ...Some things I liked about the book ...- The different voices giving perspectives on the same events. The truth is a secret garden and we all look into the garden from a different vantage point. Each bush and shrub is a cultural, personal or similar impediment to seeing the complete picture, and Barbara Kingsloveruses her device to good effect.- The political, social, economic and cultural drivers are well brought out, and their implications on the outcomes of everyday life is thoughtful and so well constructed- The writing itself is evocative and movingSome things I did not like about this book ...- It is too long. The last \\"books\\" could quite easily have been replaced by an epilogue, and would (imo) have carried more weight. The later stories of the women would have been better served in follow up books, as a series maybe.- It is too euro-centric. This has the (unintended?) consequence of transmogrifying it into a polemic against Western culture, values and mores. Sketchily decrying western consumerism and the avariciousness of big business allied to political expediency does not reflect the reality of the world's steady drift into exactly that milieu. In the final History of the World as seen by Mankind, will it matter that we rape and pillage our societies and geographies by proxy or through our own efforts?- For a work of such high ambition, it does not answer the \\"so what?\\" test, nor does it point a way forward: it drifts to its own conclusion, flotsam and jetsam washed up by a high tide of introspection."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I really couldn't stop. My mother bought this book for me yesterday, as it's required reading for my AP English class. I read the first two hundred pages yesterday and the remaining three hundred and fifty today.If you're reading this, you probably already know the basic plot. A family from Georgia--Nathan Price, his wife Orleanna, and their daughters Rachel, Leah, Adah, and Ruth May set out for the Congo on a missionary trip. In the process, each of the family members is consumed, in their own way, by the continent of Africa.But there's more to it than that. The book is narrated by the women of the family, and each of them has their own cross to bear. Orleanna feels she is trapped in a loveless, abusive marriage. Rachel simply misses the comforts of home. Adah is probably the most interesting and unique character. She did not get enough oxygen in the womb, and as a consequence walks with a limp and sees things backwards. You might get sick of plowing through her sections of the book, which are full of palindromes and other nonsense, but it's worth it to stick with her. Then there's Adah's twin sister, Leah. She blames herself for Adah's plight. She also adores her abusive father, and struggles to shape her own identity. Ruth May is the baby of the family, and her primary trait, according to her sisters, is \\"stick-to-it-ivness.\\" Even the patriarch of the family, Nathan, has something beneath the surface.This book is at its best in the first half, when it is describing the lives of the whole family in Africa. After they split up, it slows down--which is odd, because the first 250 pages describe a year, while the next 250 describe thirty. But the last half of the book is primarily a history lesson/anti-imperialist tract. While these are good and just themes, the point was getting across just fine in the context of a compelling story beforehand. That's the only thing that stopped me from giving the book five stars. At times, the author seemed to leave the voice of the characters behind in order to make her political points.You'll probably cry in this book, but you'll laugh, too. Rachel tends to mix up words--like when she describes the American concept of marriage as \\"monotony,\\" rather than \\"monogamy.\\" So it's not all some deep, dark history lesson.While it's definitely serious literature, I'd be more inclined to recommend The Poisonwood Bible to a woman. As I said, it's told from the point of view of women, and many of its main themes, from motherhood to romance to sisterhood, seem to be more easily appreciated by women. That said, if you're looking for a serious work and a new perspective about imperialism in Africa, I can't think of a better book for man or woman."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I ensconced myself in this book! Literally. I started with the audio version where I listened to it on my daily commute to work, and I was always disappointed to get to my destination. The beautiful sounds of the Kikongan language intrigued me so much, I then had to buy the paperback version of the book. I wanted to see how the words were spelled as well as see the palindromes that were essential to understanding the character of Adah's writing. After listening to new material in the car, I would then \\"catch up\\" that evening in the paperback book, savoring the lyricism of the writing.I found each character to stay true to form throughout their writing over the decades the book covered. The only negative thing I can say is that in the final \\"two books\\", a great deal of Congolese/Zairean history was reviewed and it felt a little forced.Until the last two years, I read non-fiction almost exclusively and so I \\"discovered\\" Barbara Kingsolver only recently. The first novel I read by Barbara was \\"Prodigal Summer\\", which I thoroughly enjoyed and thereby decided to read additional books authored by her. \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" was delightful in both audio and book format, and I plan to read some of the books Barbara noted in her afterward about the history of the Congo and Zaire."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible: A Novel (P.S.)I've read this at least half a dozen times in the last several years & ALWAYS find nuances and plot points that are new.

You would have to be a piece of wood if you do not feel the emotional high's &amp; lows of this section of the novel.The last third is almost an after-thought and loses the amazing energy of the first 2/3rds(You will know when you reach this part and wish you stopped if you continued to the end).Overall I did like this book and do recommend it to people looking for a good read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kingsolver's most recent novel was my first experience as one of her readers and it took me about 130 pages to become hooked. By that time, however, I was unable to turn my back on the personal, vibrant story of the Price family. The year is 1959. Nathan Price, his wife and four daughters have moved from Georgia to the the Congo in order to evangelize the people there, believing Jesus Christ to be the one and true God. The daughters, ages 5-16, take turns telling the story from each of their points of view; the struggles they have as a family, the difficulty in preaching &quot;one God&quot; to a village that believes in &quot;the gods,&quot; the adjustment to living in a jungle, etc., etc. Father Price becomes more horrible as the story proceeds, caring less and less for the welfare of his family. When political chaos begins to endanger the Price's and every other American family returns to the States, Nathan's family stays on in the Congo until a terrible tragedy shocks everyone into silence and empowers Mother Price to make a striking move for her girls. Kingsolver then proceeds to follow each character individually through their lives for the next twenty-five years, telling their personal story as well as Africa's story. Passionately written, elegantly told and completely riveting, I could not agree more with Oprah on this one. Just don't give up unless you've passed the 130-page mark. You'll be glad you didn't."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is by far the best book I have read in a long, long time. Kingsolver has outdone herself. It just bowled me over.

The characters are especially well drawn and each is unique and memorable. Telling the story from the viewpoint of each of the women is a masterful touch and the author makes wonderful use of this device. I enjoyed reading about African politics and thought Kingsolver did a good job of weaving them into the story.The only reason I deducted a star was because the story seemed to go on for too long. Cutting back fifty to seventy-five pages would have made this book a perfect five-star read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Was figuring on a probable five-star rating here til the last third or so of the novel, which I found incredibly disappointing. Everything I was loving about it--the people of the village, the snakes, the ants--all things wonderfully &quot;congo-ish&quot;-- abruptly ended after the adorable little girl (whom I also loved) died. It was all down hill from there. How the surviving members of the Price family go on with their lives after their time in the Congo, each in extremely different ways, is interesting stuff, but not as fascinating as living and struggling in the Congo. Added to that, I think the storytelling itself became quite poor. I felt myself becoming more and more distanced from the characters as I got closer and closer to the end. By the end, I didn't really care about them at all. But I loved the first half!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Other people love this book and others say it's slow but stay with it.

This is easily her best work so far."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I picked up this book because the title intrigued me. The book speaks to the reader from the 5 voices of the mother and daughters. It is an amazing evolution that takes place. Each daughter view the Congo and the father in a completely different way. From embracing the experience to counting the days that they can return to the US. I find my self with conflicting views of the father who is heavy handed and dogmatic. I find my self siding with one of the daughters and eagerly wait for her to continue talking. It is like you become a part of this family and live the trials and few joys of their lives in the Congo."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book is essentially centred around the one chararacter who is not given a voice in it - Nathan Price. Its fundamental structure makes it interesting, despite the fact that its core character is one-dimensional and unlikeable. The contrasting and vibrant characters of his four daughters who act as multiple narrators give the reader the rare privilege of developing a rounded and objective opinion of circumstances surrounding the missionary family, which could be easily blurred by the rich description of life in the lush but unforgiving Congo. Although the book closely examines the Price family dynamic it also demonstrates the potential and importance of the individual agent especially when acting within an extreme physical and spiritual environment like the Congo. It's not about God, it's about girls - Rachel, Leah, Ada and Ruth May."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"There are some books that you read and you say to yourself, \\"My, that was good.\\" And then there are some books that you read and say to yourself, \\"A world of souls wrote this, and I will miss them all for the rest of my life.\\" The voices of this book are so real, and so naturally developing, that you get the feeling that the characters actually wrote the book. They go from talking in their own voices to talking in each other's voices to finally talking in the voices of their parents. If you flip through the book you will see chapter titles taking you into the points of view of the sisters and their mother, but the father never seems to have a say (the reader might say that he doesn't need one, but then, according to Africa, none of them need one. According to the world we are blessed that they all get a say). By the end of the novel, however, you realize that the father has had his say the whole time, and not just by sheer force but by the presence of heredity of trait. A lyrical novel of growth, Kingsolver's greatest accomplishment is showing maturing through voice alone. It was difficult for this reader to picture the sisters getting older because I didn't want to happen, but happen it does, even for the oldest and least grown-up of the bunch. Change is not only good in this book, it is a wonder that is fought and embraced and fought and embraced so often that a person has to cry out in ecstasy or irony after a while. I hope that I cried out for the right reasons, but, as sister Leah Price says (in a paraphrasing), rights and wrongs in this book take a whole new turn. If you have not yet read this book you'd best be doing it, for all of the right and wrong reasons."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Maybe the story of the driver ants is a tall tale (I wouldn't know), but this novel about the Belgian Congo (turned Zaire turned the Democratic Republic of Congo turned Congo, most recently) was utterly fascinating--all 550 pages of it. I would never have thought that a novel about Africa would have interested me, but now I want to read as much as I can about this embattled country. Like other readers, I felt a little short-changed with the last quarter of the book. It seemed like an editor must have been looking over Ms. Kingsolver's shoulder and whispering in her ear as she wrote it--&quot;get to the end already.&quot; Even though I wished the pace wouldn't have sped up in the last part of the novel, I was still in tears by the end. One thing I was hankering for throughout though: more of Oleanna's perspective. I loved her voice and the poetry of her words. I will definitely read more Kingsolver. I can only hope that her other books are as rich and inspiring as this one."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I enjoyed The Poisonwood Bible very much. The narrative style of writing, in which the mother and each daughter told their story was excellently done. Each woman/girl had her own distinctive way of writing, and it wasn't long before I could tell which was writing just by the style of writing. This book makes you think, yet it is not heavy-handed. There is just enough politics to let you know what was going on, but it does not overpower the story. The timing was perfect, and there was just the right balance in the telling of the story. I found the descriptions, both physical and emotional, wonderfully done."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible was an entertaining novel of a southern, baptist family's adventures in the Belgian Congo. While I have never read a novel like this before, it was very enjoyable. Kingsolver, the author of the novel, writes with great imagery. Her use of imagery paints a vivid picture of the jungle, where you can almost feel the heat, smell the trees, and hear the jungle noises as one reads along. One can almost feel the sympathy and compassion for the Price girls for their experiences growing up in such a dangerous place while at the same time wishing you were there. There is also an element of foreshadowing in the very beginning of the novel. Orleana, Nathaniel's wife, is the first to begin talking about her experiences in the Congo. On the first page she tells the reader to not begin to feel sympathy until the story is through. That foreshadows the depth to come and the rebellion and fighting amongst the villagers and how the family reacts. Kingsolver uses an interesting and different way to bring us this historic and political novel. She allows each member of the family, ironically excluding Nathaniel, to give their own point of views. It is fascinating how through the eyes of individuals you can see so much and notice things you never would have noticed alone."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I picked this book up in hardcover when it first was published because Newsweek magazine reviewed it well. I was certainly not disappointed. I have read it 3 times and shared it with some friends and family members - all of whom lauded it as well. I also read THE BEAN TREES and PIGS IN HEAVEN by Kingsolver, but neither of those holds a candle to this book, which is nearly a work of art.The story is told through the eyes of four sisters and their mother - each chapter has a 'different' author. The story line is very compelling, the prose beautiful, and the characters superbly engaging. This is a must read book for anyone who truly enjoys a great story that is well told. Please read it - I guarantee it will be well worth your while!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I read *The Poisonwood Bible* because my Reading Group chose it, and the first chapter really didn't grab me. I'd read the back cover, and I thought I knew what the book was about--and as the review/summary at the top of Amazon's page says, in literature, &quot;men who drag their families to far-off climes in pursuit of an Idea seldom come to any good.&quot; It seemed obvious where the story was going to take me.But I persevered, and the story began to draw me in, and I found out that I was wrong. Yes, some things turned out as I expected (to me, Ruth May's fate wasn't the surprise that the author seemed to have intended), but then--but then it went on from there. I read a lot of books, and with so many of them, the patterns of the stories are established so early, and the author doesn't even seem to attempt to be surprising. With this book, the author gradually reveals a stubbornness, a determination to tell a story that is nothing like the reader was expecting--and all the more powerful for that. Ultimately, it's quite terrific.I disagree with the reviewer who complains about Kingsolver's politics. Her view is startling, refreshing, and educational for someone who doesn't know all that much about the specifics of politics in the Congo during this time period. The book is also written in such a way that if you don't agree with Kingsolver's political bent, the context of her characters opinions is deep enough that you understand *why* they hold these opinions--even if it is uncomfortable to read how lightly the United States seemed to treat the problems of central Africa during this time period.This book is a joy to read. A consummate piece of writing that reminds you how good it is to spend your night involved with a book rather than glassily dozing in front of your tv."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver managed to captivate me with this complex novel. I was as entranced with the story of the characters (a missionary, his wife, and their daughters) as with the political history lesson about the Belgian Congo. The characters are very real, and when they find themselves in the midst of personal and political crises' they each find their own path. The observations of the wife and mother at the end of the story were so touching I was in tears. This is now one of my favorite books!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I have a funny rule about reading books set in a country other than the United States, I tend to have trouble relating and identifying with the subjects. In this case, I was so touched and in tune with the characters it was amazing.

It was truly an amazing book that I have recommended time and time again."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kingsolver leads you into a richly textured collision of 1950's America and the Congo...a dynamic journey until halfway through when the device subtley, but decisively shifts from showing to telling. And what it tells is cynicism, rage, bitterness, sadness. I kept hoping for a glimmer of forgiveness but there was none to speak of. Nathan may have died but his same brand of single-minded blindness lived on in all of his daughters. Some of them just disguised it better."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This novel uses character and setting to relate an epic. The unsuspecting American reader is stripped and returned to a condition of physical and psychological survival through the experiences of the five Price females, each of whom provides a different perspective and solution. The author beautifully maintains the individual voices and gives comic relief in the character Rachel, whose malapropisms are cleverly done. The language is general is lush and poetic. Unfortunately, politics dominates in the last part of the novel to the detriment of the story line; nevertheless, the ending is satisfying. This book is well worth your time!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"An amazing book - everyone should read this. What a wonderful book - has truly changed my views on life and Africa."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Trying to read slowly and not devour this story has been a challenge. The story is well told and the voices of the daughters, tripping over love fear and loathing for their father, are a wonderful perspective for this tale. The differences in the voices and the directions in which the story unfolds are remarkable. The story is very apt as far as attitudes, through the eyes of the young girls, displaying all different behaviors from the naturalist to the self-centered. It only begins to drag after the climax, but the story is still important. And I enjoyed learning a little history along the way."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"It is a treat to come across an author who writes so well. This is a beautifully written book about the Belgian Congo (Africa) in the 19th century. Reads easily, delightful characters, humorous and poignant. It is rare to come across such eloquent writing."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is Kingsolver's best writing: a mammoth effort of narrative, allegory, religion, philosophy. A great novel for a book-discussion group."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"It took a long time to read this book. Great theme and great characters. In places, the poetic background of the author gave the story a sence of poetic rambling. I found myself skipping those places insearch of the real story. Would I recommend this to a friend? Maybe. Would I read this author again? NO!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I am only 16 years old, and I read thi sbook for a school project. I found that I couldn't put it down . The style in which Kingsolver writes is poetic, and yet it keeps you coming back for more!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I have read and absolutely loved all of Kingsolver's previous works, especially The Bean Trees, and I must admit I expected something more out of the Poisonwood Bible. I did enjoy the multiple points of view and the vivid voices on the daughters in the family. Adah is a masterpiece in character development. But, other characters were disappointing. I was not raised by a baptist missionary nor was a child of the 50-60's, but I found the father hard to believe as a character. He never showed a speck of compassion for his wife or children, and I thought that was a grave mistake in character development. Most disappointing, however, was the story structure. The climax occurs approx 350 pages in, but I was forced to sit through an additional 200 pages of what seemed to be a prolonged &quot;wrapup.&quot; And to top it all off, the last line of the book is a stale cliche."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I loved the way she created such a vivid Africa in this book. I also appreciated the humor and the different perspectives of the narrators. Few people had mentioned Brother Fowles. I thought he and his part in the story were very clever and interesting."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I have loved all of Kingsolver's previous books and bought TPB on the strength of it. However, while there are moments of brilliance in the book, I struggled to finish it. You can almost visualise Kingsolver's learning curve if you read her books in chronological order, but TPB is almost too big a project for her to have undertaken (yet). I didn't mind the essayist approach to the Congo's history as Kingsolver's politics are to be admired and if nothing else, it was educational. I couldn't stand any of the characters in this book but maybe that's what Kingsolver intended."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I won't take your time with jargon as I'll assure you that you will want to quickly move on reading descriptions about another book. I agree 100% with the reviewer roxie52. This book should have ended halfway through and not waste our time reading more. Maybe there was a word quota? Who knows.Do not recommend.

I chose to read this one because it came highly recommended to me. If you know nothing of the book it is about a missionary family sent to the Congo to help bring a small village back to God. The Price family is led by the dominating minister followed by his subservient wife and their four daughters. The book tells of thier trials and tribulations over the course of thier lives in the Congo, all while the Congo fights for it's independence from Belgium. I personally found this book to be a big disappointment. Not only was it one of the most boring works I had ever read, but when an author tries to force their political views on me, I tend to reject them. I feel that the book might have been a bit better had her political views not been stated in every other chapter. I also found it very confusing when each chapter was narrated by a different member of the Price family. If an author wants each chapter narrated by a different person, the reader should be able to differentiate the characters from one another. I personally would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I had high hopes for this book, although it being an Oprah book has nothing to do with it.

It's long and drawn out and is kind of a hard read, especially if you have a short attention span, but I do not regret picking it up. I wouldn't highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver's complicated novel of a profoundly dysfunctional family meddling disasterously in affairs where they had no business was so depressing I was glad I only paid twenty five cents for it at a yard sale.She flung out beautiful, poetic prose like so much mud scattering from a bull floundering in a dried-up mudhole. The more she heaped on the uglier it got. Such a waste.She insulted people who have sacrificed their very lives for the people of the Congo and glorified characters from history who failed them. She insulted the United States of America. She insulted missionaries of every faith.Her attempt to cast a failed political system in a favorable light failed utterly."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"FOR 6 BUCKS IT COULD HAVE BEEN MISSING PAGES I WAS SUPPRISED AT THE QUALITY"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Happy Festivus.

I give it 2 stars because it is obviously well-written, but it is just one big incessant ramble. I thought it would never end; thank God I was wrong. The book is a composition of \\"journal entries,\\" although the characters never really wrote in journals. One of the characters is a little girl who writes her chapters at the college level. The main flaw with this book is that the characters are completely unlikeable. One daughter is a vain superficial jerk (and I liked her the best out of all of them, which is not saying much), the other is a pretentious snob, the other is mentally handicapped and annoyingly writes a lot of things backwards, and the 4th daughter is a little girl who seems to have terrible luck. The mother is submissive to the father and shrouds herself in self-pity, and the father is a preacher who does nothing BUT preach.I understand why women would like this book (...), but if you are a red-blooded male who enjoys car chases, explosions, and the occassional romantic comedy (who didn't love You've Got Mail!), do not subject yourself to the torture of reading this book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I would never recommend this book to anyone it hurts my soul that other people enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I love this book for several reasons. For one, Kingsolver does an excellent job with her characters. I really believed I was, in all places, in the middle of Africa caring about this family-hoping they will be happier, hoping the stupid patriarch doesn't do something too harm anyone...ooops. It's been years since I've read the book but I can still see, almost touch, the characters. That in itself speaks of great writing and a great story. Some people like to categorize all Christianity as being toxic. More sane and less bitter people know better. Kingsolver does an excellent job of depicting toxic Christianity while at the same time we read through the lines of the book how much better healthier Christianity could have addressed the problems in the Congo.Although the novel isn't written from a Christian perspective this novel could very easily have become preachy (against toxic Xianity), but Kingsolver is too good a writer to get anywhere near that possibility.One of my favorite novels ever. A classic."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver's The Poisonwood Bible is a beautifully crafted work of art. The story of Nathan and Orleanna Price and their four daughters is one that will haunt you long after you have turned the last page. Nathan is a self-righteous Baptist preacher, who along with his beaten down wife, go against all sense and church support in their attempt to convert the Congo. Their mission is doomed from the start, and the more radical Nathan becomes, the faster the family falls apart. Rachel, the oldest daughter, represents pop culture of the late 1950s. Her attempts to be popular and to fit in are as unlikely to happen as her getting a twinset for her 16th birthday. Leah represents the American conscience. She attempts to right the wrongs she sees as she attempts to cross cultures, and she spends her life in Africa. Adah, who is born with hemiplegia, sees the world in anagrams. Her perspective is as unique of one as I have ever read in ANY novel. Finally, Ruth May, the baby of the family, is the one who suffers the most for the sins of the father.The characters, with the exception of Nathan Price, develop over decades, and we see how Nathan's religiosity and how their individual experiences in the Congo affect their adult lives and relationships. This novel transcends the historical fiction genre by incorporating the themes of familial conflict, self-righteousness and its capacity to destroy, and racism, among others. The historical and geopolitical setting is an added bonus, from my point of view.This novel will haunt you. Its language, characters, and story is one for the ages."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is the best work yet of Barbara Kingsolver. The story is set in the Congo with a missionary family struggling to find its place in this fierce country. The writing is masterful. Kingsolver writes eloquently from four characters' points of view and conveys the nuances of each of their personalities in an astounding way. This book can stand up against Hemingway and Steinbeck in its beauty and depth. It is now being read in various high schools in California and I believe it to be her best novel yet."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"how would you survive in deep africa? i'm sure i wouldn't. this is a heartbreaking story about one family's horrific experience. the characters are amazing as is kingsolver's ability to tell the story in so many voices! what a gift! i loved each character (except the father) and worried about her. i found myself walking around holding this book and finding any opportunity to read it. couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I found the range of views about this book quite interesting and varied. I have just finished reading the book. I do not like the Price family one bit; it doesn't, however, affect how I like the story. It is a beautiful novel told in a rich language and reads like poetry. Kingsolver's attention to detail is incredible and for me it outweighs the fact that the daughters' voices, as one reader wrote, are not distinct enough. I read it through and found that it just flows; the narrators tell a story and it didn't matter who was saying exactly what, the important thing was what they were telling us. The father is portrayed as cruel and cold and really there is not anything to like about him.I am amazed that people will review this book and complain about having politics shoved down their throats; 1) I am entirely responsible for what I choose to read. 2) It is Barbara Kingsolver's right as the author to say whatever she feels like, not what she thinks I will agree with. Amazing, the audacity of reviewers to say that she should not express her opinions.I am giving this book five stars because, even though it is far from the best novel I ever read, I do like the storyline, the suspense, and the beautiful prose."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I was very drawn into this story about a family whose father takes them on his Christian mission to Africa to \\"save\\" the people of the Congo during the 1960's. Along with the obvious lifestyle adjustments the mother and four daughters have to make, a lot of attention is given to the political situation in the Congo at this time as they declare independence from Belgium which makes for intriguing reading for one not familiar with African politics and history. The story is told from the mother and each daughter's viewpoint - identifying how the events around each affect them as a family and as individuals. I would have liked to hear some of the story from the father's viewpoint (what was he thinking?!?) The details about the villagers' way of life and survival are excellent and the wrapup involving the political discussions and later lives of the daughters gives you a real taste of how this mission to Africa really changed each of their lives in a drastic way."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"A fanatical Baptist minister tales his long-suffering wife and four daughters to the Congolese jungle. The chapters are mainly the narratives, over many years, of the daughters, each of whom speaks with a very different voice as they grow up. Brilliant evocation of life, customs and suffering in the Congo. How does Kingsolver know it all?"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I loved this beautifully written book until soon after the part where the mother and daughters left the father. It should have ended then, because that was obviously the climax of the story. Instead, the book went on unnecessarily for another hundred or so pages with the characters' lives after that climactic event.That said, I found this book to be Kingsolver's best by far. Her device of telling the story through the eyes of different characters was brilliant and made for multilayered portrayals of most of the major characters. Her prose, as I said above, is beautiful: deft, rich, and delicately wrought. Her understanding of the Congo made me feel I was there. Simply one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Nathan Price, a holy-roller Baptist preacher in the 1950s, drags his wife and four daughters off to the Belgian Congo to preach the gospel to the heathens. This book is written in the voices of the four daughters and the mother, which I thought were each distinct and believable. It is fascinating to see the exploration of faith, love, hate, ego, and bigotry as it is played out among the stranded Price women and the increasingly insane Nathan Price. Unlike the typical novel, which would have probably ended when the Price women finally left Nathan, this one continues on so that you find out what happened to the girls after they grew up. A thought-provoking lesson about African politics and culture and America's ethnocentrism."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"i first read this book when i was twelve and got little meaning or understanding out of it. now five years later i re-read it for my junior research paper. the level of understanding and knowledge that Barbara Kingsolver potrays in her novel is simply amazing. i found myself to have a greater understanding and a much greater knowlege of the trials and tribulations that a white American family would have during the 1960's in Central Africa during their time of Independance. Through the Price family's gained understanding of the African culture, we as Americans can truly see and appreciate our American lifestyle. I believe that it is important for people to read this book because of the recondite worldview that Kingsolver's novel allows us to have."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Great start and wonderful character development, but the book becomes tedious about midway through. In the intial stages I loved the parts about how the family was learning and adjusting to life in the Congo. Halfway through after the incident with the youngest child, the book seems to devolve into a laborious mass. The injection of overt political rants really shifts the focus away from the characters and onto the author who is obviously trying to make some statement (although one is never quite sure what her point is). In the end it becomes a chore just to get to the end. Even then, there really is no resolution in the final chapters, the book just comes to a stopping point."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book desperately needs to be edited."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I am a fan of Kingsolver. However, my mother raved over this book and I was very disappointed. I liked the general topic of the book but the constant character switching was very confusing. The eldest daughter was the only one who was a fully developed character. The last 200 pages were a CHORE to finish. My librarian said that she never could finish the darn book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Satan wins in this book: the serpent destroys one child, and through that event it destroys the faith of another, destroys the potential of another, destroys the mission of the father, and sends the mother into such selfish desperation that she oversees the destruction of most of the others. Satan also has a new weapon: a best-selling novel which teaches that salvation is not through accepting what Christ did on the cross, but through attending church and water baptism. There were other silly mistakes of doctrine.The book was good for showing flaws in cultural understanding: a good example is the Baptist who thinks he can use a crocodile-infested river; but it fails to explain why he could not use a tub as he sometimes did in Georgia. And how much more powerful this theme would be if Kingsolver abandoned the misconceptions about Christianity! What if her characters had had all the difficulties in adjusting to a new culture, but then they slowly learned to adapt - not the message! - but the delivery of the message to the circumstances of the new culture. That would have been a powerful book.The father is a Baptist missionary. However, he is a poor Christian. He knows his Bible verses, but not what they mean, he bears no fruits of the Spirit, he misrepresents the Bible greatly, and he thinks his mission is to bring manners and proper dress as much as to save souls.Even within his own family, the father has failed to teach the essentials. The mother and children are not saved or thoroughly grounded in who Jesus is. They think all hardship is God's punishment and that there is always reward for hard work. God is supposedly punishing the father with haunting memories, but this is not Christian conviction, but rather an affliction of guilt. For the mother too, there is no healing, for she is still plagued years later. She never learned to have faith or hope, that God will forgive and heal you if you let him in.Thinking God will punish you for a sin of which you have since repented is counter to what the Bible says. Thinking God will always reward your hard work by granting your wishes - however irrelevant to his cause - is counter to what the Bible says. Thinking you can make your own path in God's service without listening to the voice of God is counter to what the Bible says. I found it difficult to determine if Kingsolver had an incomplete understanding of the Bible or if she was purposely endowing her character with an incomplete understanding too egregious for a Baptist preacher.The missionary family think God should protect them from everything, just like the natives expect from their gods. However, God does not promise to shield the believer from all evil: even Paul had a thorn in his flesh and Christ himself had crucifixion! What God does promise is to carry you through anything if you rely on him, and that they failed to do. This could have been an inspiring book, if Kingsolver had chosen to plague her characters and then have them, through faith and work, overcome those obstacles, but instead, she allows them to dissolve into nothing better than the superstitious natives they have come to teach. What is the point of the conflict if the characters don't grow from it? They remain self-righteous and they lose what little faith they had.It is not Africa which defeats or changes them so much as the failure of God to perform to their warped expectations. How much better the book would have been if the father understood his own faith and mission, and grew into both by Africa's influence. However, because they don't understand their own faith or mission, they are doomed to fail from the start. Kingsolver could have delivered her message about the atrocities of American foreign policy and the sophistry of American cultural arrogance, without casting the Christians with such pitiful inner resources. She shows a lack of empathy for her creations never before seen in her work.Even the writing disappointed me. It is a step up in complexity for her, with recurring themes and more symbolism, but I missed her simple elegance with which she captured my emotions in her earlier books. I wish I hadn't read this book. However, as the Bible says, God can take our times of trouble and make them productive. So shall I endeavor to do with this. I still wish Kingsolver's characters could have done the same."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I sampled this book recently because I heard Oprah chose it. I was frustrated by the lack of historical integrity. I felt preached upon by a story with a narrow and faulty point of view. If this was simply left as a piece of fiction I might have been able to swallow it.I write this review because a previous reviewer stated some of the same points. And I'd like others to know that it just isn't one persons' view.The book is well written trash, preachy at best!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"It took all I had to read half way through this book. But I had to finally succumb to boredom and throw it away. It is a very rare occasion when I don't finish a book, out of pure curiosity if nothing else. But I'm glad to be done with this load of annoying nonsense. If you enjoy corny shallow characters,and stories that try so hard to be funny and at the same time political then you'll enjoy this. Otherwise, don't even bother.How this author is so popular, I'll never quite figure out."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is a tragic, fiction adventure novel with a slight political outlook. The wife and four daughters of a strict preacher tell their story of a mission trip to the Belgian Congo in 1959. The Price family's unwillingness to adapt to their new environment is the cause of their tragic undoing. Over a course of 30 years, we watch a family survive Congo's fight for independence from Belgium, the murder of it's first elected prime minister, the CIA's attempts to replace him and an uncivilized culture attempt civilization only to watch their family to grow apart and move away, scared by their experiences in the untamed nations of Africa. Rachel, the shallow vain, eldest child tries to bring appearances to the attention of the starving African children, but they think her to be a monster and avoid the arrogant girl who grows up to live a distraught life. The first of twins, Leah is a brave headstrong girl who often lets her temper and emotions get the best of her. Leah becomes most attached to the Congo and grows up to marry a native. The second twin, Adah, creates in her mind the illusion that she is a cripple and must not speak nor be accepted as normal; she wishes to be pitied. The last of the Price daughters, Ruth May, lives a short life and dies young, but represents a very important role in society.Overall, The Poisonwood Bible was a rather interesting read. While the words are simple and easy to understand, they build up complex sentences filled with metaphors and long descriptions, the book was set up like a series of hills: many adventures placed on either side of low, boring, dry valleys; there were a lot of scenes that simply dragged on for far too long. Although Barbara Kingsolver has been known to be an amazing writer, I personally strongly advise the casual reader to by pass this book. Unless you have loads of spare time, there are other books on the shelf."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This was my first and last Kingsolver book! As an avid reader, I felt like I'd wasted a lot of quality reading time with this one. It was boring and so very depressing! Also regret spending money for such a disappointing book!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Oh, the evils of white Christian men! This radical-chic screed leaves no clich&eacute; unturned--Phil Donahue could have written it if Marlo had given him permission. Couldn't finish it, but why bother? It was clear from the first page that this would be an object lesson in all the bad things about people Kingsolver fears and despises. Oh, bad bad man. Poor victimized women and noble Africans. Tr&eacute;s boring."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Sooooo disappointing; I saw all these wonderful reviews from so many newspapers and I thought it would be wonderful. I love stories set in Africa, regardless of the era. After the first 100 pages, the book seemed like it would never end. I felt it was a book written for children, from the point of view of 4 children. Definitely not a book for someone who enjoys good literature!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Yes, it starts off slow, but gradually picks up. It's not an airport novel! I only read about ten pages a night, which allowed me to savor and fully appreciate the power of Kingsolver's prose, her creativity, and the depth of her insights.The Poisonwood Bible is of course about an American family that goes on a Christian mission to an isolated village in the Congo on the eve of independence in 1959. I had read the author's book of essays, High Tide in Tucson, last summer, and was very impressed. But I was particularly interested in this book because I have been studying African religions and Christian missionization first-hand and teaching the anthropology of religion for almost thirty years. I found the story to be exceptionally realistic and knowledgeable(although my experience does not extend to the Congo). I can easily think of real life examples of many of the characters in this novel from my own fieldwork, including the fanatical Nathan Price, the kindly Brother Fowles, the gentle but determined revolutionary Anatole, and the vile mercenary Axilroot. I also see too many Rachels in my classrooms, and I wish there were more Adahs and Leahs.I am puzzled and saddened to read some of the negative reviews on these pages, because this book has the power to change profoundly the way Americans see and understand Africa, although in most cases it seems to have succeeded."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Upon reading the opening sentences of The Poisonwood Bible, I immediately felt surrounded by jungle. I could sense its conflicting nature - lush, bountiful magnificence coexisting with harsh, strangling decay.But The Poisonwood Bible is by no means merely a travelogue. It is so much more than just the journey of the Price family (Nathan, Orleanna, and daughters Rachel, Leah, Adah and Ruth May) to the Congo. It follows the family's journey into disintegration, and the paths each member chose individually to take from that point forward.Ms. Kingsolver's prose is graceful and ripe with imagery and symbolism. Every sentence is a joy to read, with not one unnecessarily chosen word and she brilliantly creates a unique voice for each narrator. There are scenes that stay with the reader long after they've been read. A couple of times, I actually had to put the book aside for a few days, somewhat overcome by my feelings, until I felt ready to come back to it. I disagree with reviewers who felt that the book carried on too long after the Price family's departure from Kilanga. I found it fascinating to learn what each woman took with her from the Congo, and how the experience shaped their entire lives.This is a glorious piece of work. Do not miss it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book starts out great and I was totally involved but it just runs out of steam in the second half as the characters become charicatures and the politics are crammed down our collective throats. Still, it's worth reading for the first half alone and you can just skim the rest."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is one of my favorite books of all time--and trust me, I am an avid reader! I was craving this book last year when I was travelling across East Africa so I made sure to bring it along with me this time. I can't say I've been bored for a second even though this is my third time reading the book. Kingsolver has me laughing out loud in cafes and public buses. If you pick this up, you will definitely not be bored!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"She loses two stars on account of two things: The great length of the novel (this went on for something like 541 pages and could have been abbreviated to, say, 300 if a lot of the babbling had been cut out-- and it took something like 10 pages before she even got into the plot); The tone of righteous indignation that went on and on and on throughout the prose. (I could have guessed as much when she said that she sent a copy to Mumia Abu Jamal, since his name is invoked very often to make a point more than anything else). Though it's not quite the same thing, this book reminds me very vaguely of \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\\" written by a white woman who had seen one single slave and then proceeded to write a book that was hundreds of pages long and about which much of her knowledge was actually confabulated.Thoughts:1. Is there a fallacy of composition here? I am looking and find that 95% of the Congolese are Christian (in spite of the difficulty of navigating the country and even accessing certain places). Because a person can write a book about one missionary that had no training and didn't bother to learn the local language, does that mean that every missionary was that way? The end result does imply that the missionaries were much more succesful than what we would guess based on this author's rambling.2. The author seems to make out the Kikongo language to be a lot bigger than what it is. Doing a bit of reading, I find that there are 7 million people who speak it (and that is among the Belgian Congo, Angola the French Congo). I believe that part of the author's wanting to present The Noble Savage vs. The Depraved White Man was trying to convince us that there were some huge number of people who already spoke a common language living in peace before the latter came along and destroyed it.3. The characters were generally very well developed-- and could have been equally well developed in half the space. The idea of using the voices of the 4 daughters to emphasize different aspects of African live was very clever.4. Even for all her writing, the author does not solve the issue of whether the Congo's poverty is because of indigenous stupidity or meddling white men. It was beyond the scope of the book, but it does not take much to notice that the natives went from one unsuitable form of government to something MUCH WORSE.5. Oh, here we go with dependency theory again, the idea that: \\"...resources flow from a \\"periphery\\" of poor and underdeveloped states to a 'core' of wealthy states, enriching the latter at the expense of the former.\\" I get so sick of hearing that idea spun out again and again and again (not least because it's not quite true). This book was no exception.6. Toward the end of the book (which flew by, all except the last 150 or so pages), I got really sick of the author's hysterical apologizing for/ indictment of Western society.7. I know that the author was trying very hard to show off her verbal dexterity, but it is hard to find the pithy parts in between the babbling.This book is about worth a second hand purchase and a not-too-careful read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book was wonderfully written, in the beginning. It could have done without about 250 pages or so off the end, but I did feel compelled to finish it. The descriptions of nature and the congolese was enthralling, and in my opinion the one thing that kept me hanging on. My big complaint was that towards the end the author's own political viewpoints and perception of evangelical fundamental Christians simply became too much. I think it can easily be seen that the novel is intended to be a political mouth-piece for the author. While I do not know much about African politics, I am leary of forming opinions about it from a novel such as this. It was a page turner though! No complaints there."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The \\"Poisonwood Bible\\" was mandatory reading my senior year of high school but it remains one of my favourite novels to this day. I remember it was also one of the best-liked among my classmates of all our required readings.\\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" is a fictional tale that chronicles the lives of a family from their innocence entering the Congo on a missionary trip in the 50's to their lives years later after the family's undoing. The story is told through the perspective of the mother and her four children over the course of several decades.This book blends religion, politics and human psychology into one wonderful masterpiece. The characters are interesting, unique and very dynamic. The plot is complex, moving, believable... and never boring! Many of the political and religious issues in this book are based in truth, though the characters themselves are a product of the mind of Kingsolver. Though there are some inaccuracies on the side of Baptist theology and a few other minor areas, the book is otherwise fantastic. Have tissues handy; this book can be both deeply sad and uplifting.A few people have critised this book as \\"anti-white\\" or \\"anti-male\\" because the primary antagonist character in the book -- Nathan Price -- is both. The fact that the most flawed and unlikeable character in the book happens to embody both these characteristics is really irrelevant; I did not get the impression that Kingsolver was trying to generalise this to all whites or males, either intentionally or subconsciously. There are both good and bad white characters and good and bad men in this book. Her *true* message seems to be that of self-preservation over dogmatic ideologies, both political and religious, regardless of gender or race."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"While the reactions of other book club members were mixed, I found this book difficult to put down. The jungle was real and the power of its presence overwhelming. I would have given a rating of 5 stars, but for two things.First, the narration is split between the voices of the mother and 4 daughters of a missionary zealot. While the missionary's character comes through fairly strongly through the voices of his children, his wife's character does not come through much at all, through her own voice or her children's. Perhaps this is intentional to convey her own blandness in the wake of her husband's overwhelming character, but she remains a non-entity to me.Second, there is a transition about 3/4 of the way through the book (I won't give it away) which is disturbing, in that the narrators' characters in the following segments seem to show changes too abrupt to have been precipitated by a single incident.I did find the characters' voices unique and clear throughout the book, and I was fascinated by the missionary father's inability to understand or be moved or changed by the jungle, the Congo or its people, even as his whole family is transformed."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I have just finished reading, for what I know will be only the first of many times, this incredibly crafted novel. I'm so overwhelmed with admiration for the author that I can't seem to find the words to express my feelings. This book succeeds on so many levels....the saga of the Price family's failed attempt (chiefly that of Nathan, the Baptist-minister father) to impose an uncompromising set of values and priorities on a society utterly foreign to them, the four Price daughters' and their mother's individual relatings of the story, and the overall view of humanity's role in the tapestry of life against which the story is played out are woven into a stunning tapestry that held me spellbound from the first page to the last. The characters became utterly real to me, and that is my litmus test for successful fiction. I do have to disagree with some reviewers who found the final third of the book less interesting or believable than the first two-thirds. For me, this would have been a much less memorable or powerful story had it not gone on to show the influence of their sojurn as a missionary family on the subsequent lives of each of the Price women. I am deeply grateful to the friend who recommended this book to me. It will have a place on the small section of our bookshelves reserved for my all-time favorites."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"To critique this book is to critique the view of five different women and their perspectives of a turbulent time politically, socially, spiritually, and personally.First, I enjoyed the five viewpoints and tip my hat to Kingsolver's characterization. Adah is, on the surface, the most complex creation--and I enjoyed her backward insights--but Leah sneaks up on you, becoming a woman of deep-rooted motivations and disillusionment. Rachel, for an older teen, was portrayed as, in her own words, &quot;a dumb blond,&quot; yet with this in mind I still had a difficult time accepting her misuse of language...ie. exetera (et cetera), addenda (agenda), feminine wilds (wiles), for all the teeth in China (tea in China)...You get the picture. Ruth May, the youngest, conforms to character, though a bit verbose for a five year old. Of course, Oleanna, the mother, is richly detailed in her steadfast commitments, her motherly yearnings, her deep depressions, and searching for understanding from her own offspring.Which brings me to the frustratingly brilliant aspect of this story...Nathan Price. We only come to know him through his family's perspective. This man fits the stereotype of the Great White Missionary, come to save the heathens by turning them into monogamous little Americans. Having been an MK (Missionary Kid) for a number of years myself, I can say this stereotype, sadly, has its basis. But Kingsolver sorely neglects to paint a balanced, or accurate, picture of this chosen life pursuit. Many missionaries I've rubbed shoulders with--from China to Brazil to the Czech Republic--are genuinely dedicated people who love their families foremost and adapt humbly to their second cultures rather than plundering the natives, as it were.There: Got that off my chest. I've swallowed the bitter poison of religion-turned-stark-raving-mad...and I still believe in the hope it offers when based on Biblical balance not the lunatic fringe's version of a holy calling.Nathan Price successfully sabotages his own efforts, his host village, and his precious family in the quest to save his own soul. Shame on the man. Through Kingsolver's eye for detail, we see the devastating effects of this man's metaphorical exploitation that parallels America's similar exloitation of the Congo.The crux of the issue for Oleanna, early on, is summed up in her own words: &quot;I could never work out whether we were to view religion as a life-insurance policy or a life sentence.&quot; Nathan Price clamps the chains of religion around his family's ankles and only when he is out of the picture are we allowed to witness their escape, their individual chain-dragging survival methods. Kingsolver, through emotional rawness and detailed metaphoric description of the ravaged Congo, shows the trek of these women toward the light of normalcy and acceptance.Not all will succeed in finding that light, but we care deeply as we watch the trek unfold. &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; is a book of pain and beauty, of sorrow and hope. Ultimately, like my own experience as an MK, we come to believe that one can swallow poison and still believe in the ability to move on."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver has done it once again, created another outstanding piece of modern literature.Although quite different from her earlier works she has managed to capture an essence of post-colonial Africa with sincerity and accuracy. Her use of characters to reflect the many facets of deep and complex issues is to be applauded.Clearly her most ambitious work to date, we will see this one become not just a good read, but a classic."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The opening was a lucious, fluid river of words that swept right through me: an emense relief after reading choppier, less descriptive works (e.i. jk rowling). The desription in this book is incredible and full of colorful comparisons that vividly illustrate the Congo. The first half of the book (written in 5 different points of view) recalls the arrival and settling in the congo of a Georgian missionary family, led by bible-thumping head-of the-family &quot;Our Father&quot; Nathan Price. Nathan's early attempts to &quot;save&quot; the villagers backfire on him (mothers refuse to have their children baptized in the river because of alligators) due to his extreme misunderstanding of the African culture: he sees the congolese as little children who must be punished for ignorance along with his own daughters. Meanwhile, his wife and four daughters go through famine, ants, fever, and flood to keep the house standing and feed the master. How long can they stand it? This question alone is enough to keep the reader up until 3 am flipping pages frantically. Then comes the fiery climax and tragic disaster.......and after that, an even more tragic disaster in which the book becomes hopelessly longwinded, political, and pointless. Thirty years pass at about ten years for every four pages. The characters age, but on the whole don't change after the climax. Or change too much. Preteens become mothers with kids in college before you can bat an eye-(being a teen myself, I found this wholy unnerving and could no longer connect with the characters). the only thing that kept this book from recieving 5 stars instead of 3 1/2 was the fact that it didn't simply end after a certain character's death. One final unpolished gem: the final chapter. Though it desperately needed trimming back (just like the entire 2nd half of the book)it left me feeling breathless. This chapter (set in the omnipresent eyes of someone I was waiting to speak again) establishes the importance of animals in the story as symbolism of change. The okapi, the lion, the ants, the green mamba, the eyes in the trees."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This sprawling book aims to tackle an epic subject: the revolution in the Congo, an event which has thoroughly altered the course of history in central Africa, but one which has probably never been made into as engrossing a book as The Poisonwood Bible. Kingsolver masterfully manages to encapsulate the story of the Congo by telling it through the eyes of five women, four of them girls at the beginning of the book. She creates fascinating, sometimes infuriating, and always real characters in Nathan Price, an uncompromising if myopic Baptist preacher; his wife Orleanna, who feels the effect of life in the Congo the most; and his daughters, Rachel, at first glance a self-absorbed imp but later a great survivor; Leah, whose sense of social justice consumes her; and Adah, her twin, a most complex creature who may be physically disabled but mentally, is the most perceptive, inventive, intelligent, and witty member of the family. Ruth May, the youngest daughter, is the least developed character, perhaps because of her age, but also because of her symbolic importance to the story. Kingsolver addresses the theme of survival in each of her characters, as each one chooses a different way of surviving, and their lives show the consequences of their choices. It may take place in a limited area over a limited space of time, but The Poisonwood Bible touches on themes which can apply to any reader's life."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolvr has eloquently crafted a marvel here. In the Poisonwood Bible, she relates the story of fiery, self-righteous Baptist minister Nathan Price, who drags his wife and four daughters into the Congo in 1959 for missinoary work. Settling in the village Kilanga, on the Kwilu River, adventure soon unfolds.Told from the point of view of all five female characters, the story is related very differently. Rachel, the teenager, the adolescent twins Adah and Leah, the child Ruth May, and the mother, Orleanna make up this tale.While this delivery in tale is unorthodox and rewarding, the characters all have their flaws. Rachel's self-centeredness and misplaced priorities are frustrating--she genuinely cries over a hole in her favorite dress while children starve outside--as well as her inability to use correct phrasing (a &quot;tapestry of justice&quot;). Ruth May is childly simplistic in her delivery (look for her speech on segregation in the first part of the book), and Orleanna's Earth Mother, wandering style grows tedious in the lengthy middle section.Leah and Adah are the most interesting, and I gravitated to Adah, with her disability and scorn for mankind. She is clearly brilliant, but ignored by all, especially by her smugly self-righteous (to the pointof being insufferable) father.The Poisonwood Bible is at first a slow read, for the first 150 pages, but it soon picks up as the tension rises and falls...characters like Tata Ndu, Brother Fowles, and Anatole onlyh add to the excitement, as does the revelation of what became of each of the wayward sisters as the book ends around 1998.A fiction that dips into politics, the Poisonwood Bible is an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Having loved other Barbara Kingsolver books and not questioning that I would enjoy it, I opened this book and found myself not in the south west or middle America landscape of her other books, but instead in Africa, the Congo. I was at first taken back, but realized I was not alone in my journey for the characters are American and see Africa and the Congo through American eyes. It is from this that the culture barrier is layed bare, and its the Amercians that ultimately are naked in this world.The story is told through the voices of the mother and her daughters as they come to live in Africa as a missionary family headed by misquided minister. The mistakes and friendships they make, the misunderstandings and illusions they have, and the family love and angst of a life together between connected but very different people are explored in all the rawness with which we actually live.Read it and escape to another world. Read the first chapter out loud. Finish by reading the last chapter out loud. It brought my book club to tears."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Although I don't usually relate well to books featuring Americans, I thought this book had a universal appeal. The story is set in the Congo of the 1960s and is the story of the family of Baptist missionary, Nathan Price. The story is told from the point of view of his wife, Orleanna and each of their four daughters. Although the jumps from one narrator to another are quite frequent, they were excellently handled and the narrative never sounded jerky. It had a wonderful flow. Each of the narrators has her own distinctive voice, so much so that I could open the book to any page and tell who was doing the narrating just by the tone of voice. This really made the people come alive. And, although I had a hard time identifying with the women, being a man, I did feel I had come to know them extremely well and understand their problems, hopes and fears. The politics of the Congo were well integrated in the narrative and never &quot;stood out.&quot; Be assured, this is a story about a family, not a political treatise. I also became entranced with the setting and thought the author did an excellent job of bringing the Congo alive. Definitely five stars."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver is a gift to readers! Her books and characters teach us a little bit more about ourselves and the world that we live in. &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; is a case in point. I read this hefty book in record time, absorbing the story, the characters, and the lush settings like a dehydrated sponge wanting more. The ONLY downside of the experience of the book is the feeling that the two daughters, although the most likely and even willing to change and grow through their African experience, evolved the least. They were basically the same people at the end as they were at the beginning. But, besides that one, very small dissappointment, the book was beautiful. A must read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is book starts out slow, there is no real plot, it took me about 50-100 pages to get into it. In today's zipzipzip, remote control world that can be the death of a book- I am so glad then that I persevered. I persevered because of the beautiful writing. Now that I have finished the book I have to say that it is already one of my favorites. I loved it for its writing and for the 'truths' it told me in so far that it makes one think. About words- upside down and inside out- and from words about cultures and countries, kingdoms and people that are all made up of words. There are parts and sentences that made my heart stop with dread and awe: &quot;that the young will die before the old&quot; and the whole chapter of the hunt where Leah experiences her first kill, and Anatole's scars- how the girls shrink away at first, come to see it as 'nothing more than his face', and Leah, back in America, can see others recoiling the way she had, once. The end is beautiful- the simplicity with which the theme of the book is spelled out- things, people, places come and go, but life, life goes on, and all that has gone behind has touched the world- shaped it in a way. Read this book. Bear with it. It will blossom and fruit beyond your expectations. As far as the history is concerned- I enjoyed all the parts. It wasn't propaganda- anyone old enough to read this book, to read at all, should be old enough to know what is and isn't, what opinions they want to share and learn from, or leave."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I didn't want to read this book. And even after I began reading it, it did not pull me in for several chapters. But after the first time around, through each of the voices, the characters came clearly into focus, and I was lost. Even now, days after finishing the book, I remain in the spell it cast.Kingsolver presents this experience of an uprooted middle-American family desperately trying to adapt to life in the Congo from 5 different points of view - a mother, and each of her 4 very different daughters. Similarly to Pears' technique in An Instance of the Fingerpost, Kingsolver tells a part of the story from each different viewpoint. Like Pears, each of her narrators has a strong, clear, very real personality. But Kingsolver outdoes Pears in that each of her narrators has a characteristic voice all her own. Orleanna is a desperate and naive young mother, striving to keep her children well. Rachel is the self-centered beauty queen, Leah is an earnest, brilliant tomboy, Adah is Leah's crippled, bitter, perhaps more brilliant twin, and then there is little Ruth May, bossy and competitive. Each one's different perspective meshes with the others' to create a complete and engrossing picture of the whole.In the unfolding of the drama, there is a wealth of sensory detail, and plenty of humor to offset plenty of tragedy. The incongruous differences in social outlook, and the endless language difficulties make for lots of laughs, as well as some of the biggest tragedies.Someone should slap Alix Wilber for calling Kingsolver's presentation of her philosophical and political viewpoint a &quot;weakness&quot;. The message in this book is actually a social one, and isn't that one of the responsibilities of art? And whose viewpoint should she write from, if not her own? But the political message is anything but strident; the message and the story are entirely intertwined, each enhancing the other."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The writing of the first 3-4 pages is exquisite; the first half of the story is riveting. The unloving, reality-denying nature of the father's understanding of Christianity is shown, not just asserted. After the climax in which the mother leaves the tunnel-visioned father, the book dissolves into describing the less interesting storylines of the girls' fates. Their stories would have been better told in two pages at the end of the first half. The politically correct sermonizing of the second half of the book was less clear-sighted than the religious criticism: after all, Leah sacrificed the safety and health of her children to her personal veneration of Anatole as blindly as her mother sacrificed her children to her husband's religious beliefs."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"My all-time favorite book. It's heart wrenching. Stunningly beautiful. Fantastically written. I would recommend this book to virtually anyone looking for an incredible read. It's a story of madness, culture, clashes of culture, discovery, ignorance, faith, and above all - family."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is one of the very best books I have ever listened to. The detail, descriptions and the voice are all impeccable. I have bought 3 sets and share with everyone. I drive 20-25 minutes each way to work and this filled the time perfectly."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"A rich and absorbing epic that portrays a family of American evangelical missionaries exported to post-colonial Africa (Belgian Congo). An accurate historical context serves as framework for a fictional clash of cultures and the competing sensibilities and desires within a single family as its patriarch descends into madness. The story is narrated by five individual female characters, with each voice arriving fully formed and distinct. Toward the end, Adah (one of four sisters) reflects, \\"Africa has slipped the floor out from under my righteous house, my Adah moral code. How sure I always felt before, how smug...What I carried out of Congo on my crooked little back is a ferocious uncertainty about the worth of a life...\\"This novel isn't a beach read. It takes considerable effort to digest, yes, but what meaty story does not? While I did appreciate many surprises I found in Kingsolver's early novels, this one is the product of a mature writer and thinker. I found it immensely satisfying and worthy of its bestseller status."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book is reminiscent of \\"Mosquito Coast\\", but only told from the female perspective. I found the first half of the book tough going; the characterization of the father was aggravating to me. He was just too rigid, narrow minded and oblivious to his surroundings - how someone would not bend just a little to accommodate such extreme conditions is a point of ridiculousness.The book switches between the perspectives of the Mother and her four daughters, which works well as their characters are developed, and you learn about their little quirks and differing perspectives. It also has great impact as their paths diverge in the second half of the story. However in the beginning, when you do not know the characters, it was difficult to differentiate who was who, and the switches were a little confusing.What I really appreciated in this book however was the insight into Congo life and how different our Western culture really is. It also uncovers the arrogance and criminality of the 'white invaders' in the region."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I loved \\"The Bean Trees\\" but for some reason had never picked up any of Kingsolvers other novels. \\"Poisonwood\\" certainly didn't disappoint. I was so engrossed and invested in the character's lives (especially Adah) that I had to skip to the end and find out where they ended up before I could continue reading - and I was only a quarter of the way through!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is my favorite book - hands down! The characters, the plot, the dialogue, the historical information, the humor, the cohesion and structure - all as close to perfection as is humanly possible. I found myself reading and re-reading sentences and short passages over and over simply because of the beautiful structure of that particular sentence or passage. For me, it was more like reading poetry than prose. I feel priviledged and blessed (seriously!) to have discovered this book. Only one other book has affected me as profoundly as this one - The Brothers Karamazov by Dostoyevsky. Certainly Barbara Kingsolver's body of work doesn't compare with Dostoyevsky's. But The Poisonwood Bible is genius from start to finish. An amazing and inspirational work from so many different viewpoints. I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"SPOILER ALERTBarbara Kingsolver's title for her novel, The Poisonwood Bible, is a good representation of the novel as a whole in a couple words. Present in the novel, is heartache and disappointment along with happiness and growing relationships. The family is extremely religious; however they go through difficult times just like any other human family. The novel also goes in chronological order exactly like the bible.The story takes place in Belgian Congo, Africa where the Price family is sent from their hometown in Georgia. Nathan Price is a Baptist minister who is sent there to spread God's word. The Price family consists of Orleanna, his wife, and his four daughters. This realistic storyline captures the reader by the relationships made and developed between the mother and her daughters and the Price family with the Congolese people. Kingsolver's style created an understanding of the characters in a unique way. She wrote each chapter as a different female of the Price family allowing the reader to see their thoughts and own opinions. While reading, it was apparent of Kingsolver's own opinion. Through writing about her characters, she expresses her own political view and moral view.I really enjoyed the end of the book because it's like a timeline of the Price family. It shows how they recover from their struggles, such as Ruth-May and Nathan dying or Rachel's many lovers. Also towards the end of the book you find out that Nathan Price is a deeply troubled man and has a long history. He fought in WWII and was injured. During his recovery time in the hospital his regime was bombed and everyone died. After he was told, he felt like a coward and he felt like God was always watching his next move. He needed to make up for his cowardliness somehow. After that discovery, I felt a little bit of sympathy for him and his actions throughout the book.The part I really liked was when Nelson, an orphan African-American boy, finally comes and lives with the Price family. He makes the book better by helping out the girls, by distracting the Price females from the husband always being bitter, and by being a friend. He also adds a new perspective to the novel by his background and his experiences."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I'm not digging this new thing with Amazon where I can't rate a book without writing a book about it. That said, this book was excellent. The writing style is easy to enjoy and I liked how the story was told with switching viewpoints between the children in the story (and occasionally the mother). It reminded me at times of the Sound & the Fury the way you really had to understand the perspective of the speaker to follow their version of events. Great job Barbara - I look forward to reading more of your books!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I loved this book BUT the number of typos and '?' that appear in the text of the Kindle version was frustrating. The e-book needs an edit!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The ritual of destroying an object in effigy is presumed to be an effective purgative. In the practice of voodoo, dolls are crafted in the likeness of a person and various tortures are carried out on them, with the hope that the person after whom they are modeled might suffer similar pains. During the Iranian revolution likenesses of \\"Uncle Sam\\" were burned in effigy with the hope of purging that land of its predominant western influence. It is impossible to read Poisonwood Bible in the current political climate without thinking that Kingsolver is taking a scourge of western civilization and burning it in effigy. And a lot of readers will find great satisfaction in the process.The novel opens with Nathan Price, Baptist minister, and his family of wife and four girls leaving Georgia, boarding a plane for the Belgian Congo in 1959 where Price is to serve as a minister. The destination is a remote small town, Kilanga, accessible only by small plane. When the Prices arrive, the locals have organized a feast celebration that involved the slaughter of a goat. The fete continues with half-naked women dancing in the moonlight. But of course the primitive food offends the culinary sensibilities of the Georgian women who have smuggled Duncan Hines mixes onto the plane beneath their clothing. And the nakedness of the jungle women provokes preacher Price to spew forth a bunch of nonsense about their iniquities. Needless to say, it breaks up the party.It's the first in a constant string of cultural faux pas committed by the Prices. What the Prices have done at the welcoming fete is akin to an invited guest entering a wedding reception - packed full of relatives and friends of status - and proceeding to climb onto the table at the front of the hall, to lower their pants, and to piss in the punchbowl. It's the kind of thing a person can be forgiven for doing once, perhaps. Or maybe twice. The Prices do it almost daily for a year. The sense of impending disaster builds with each example.Early on Nathan Price tries planting seeds imported from Georgia. His garden fails completely. The plants grow monstrous and fail to fruit. Partly it's because Nathan is utterly closed off to help and advice from anyone who knows better. Partly it's because these foreign plants simply cannot fruit here - they lack the necessary pollinators. It's the wrong plant for this place.After they have been in Kilanga for some months they learn that Nathan's insistence on having children baptized in the nearby river translates into a message that the locals cannot distinguish from a call to offer their children as food to the river's ravenous allegators. Nathan believes he is saving souls. The citizens of Kilanga hear human sacrifice, murder. Nathan, if he had a trace of wisdom or a sense of mission oriented toward actually reaching people would give up on talk of baptism and try a different approach. But Nathan doesn't budge.As we listen to the voices of the women who tell the story we understand that some of them are shallow, vacuous, petty. But some are wise. The wise ones see their African compatriots as real people and step into their culture. The wise ones help us understand how profoundly narcissistic, blind, closed-minded, tribal Nathan Price is. He literally sees himself as the manifestation of God in the jungle. He sees \\"unsaved\\" humans as somehow sub-human. It is axiomatic to him that what he does is good simply because he wishes to save mens' souls. Or perhaps simply because he is Nathan Price. It is a recipe for disaster. Reminds one of a song by the obscure music group Dadgum Swing: \\"Jesus loves me; but he can't stand you.\\"During the Price's tenure in Kilanga, Congo gains independence from Belgium. Voting is introduced as an institution. And then when that fails to bring the desired political result, CIA operatives install a brutal dictator, Mobuto Sesi Seko. Things in the village go from bad to worse. Finally, the youngest daughter is bitten by a snake. It's evident that the event is not completely accidental, and Nathan's wife Orleana decides it's time to leave, whether Nathan wants to go or not. Three women walk, including the lame one. The pretty, vacuous daughter flies.Kingsolver gives us glimpses of their lives over the next several decades. Each life follows a natural arc that follows reasonably from the characters she has created and their strange year in Kilanga. All are affected in profound ways by the experience. Incidentally, we learn that Mobutu dies a lonely death in one of his French Villas. Nathan Price, wide-eyed with madness, is burned in an old watchtower once used by the Belgians to guard the slave-labor miners and keep them from escaping.So by the end of the novel Kingsolver has literally burnt in effigy a symbol of western hegemony, a symbol of white patriarchy, a symbol of southern cultural myopia, a symbol of narcissim, a symbol of stark fundamentalism. There is no question that the old bastard deserved it. With the evil scourge gone, one wants to feel relieved. Or hopeful. Yet somehow life of knowing is quite painful. Kingsolver makes for the reader knowledge our sins almost as painful as the consequences of being blissfully ignorant. One is tempted to cry \\"Oh sweet ignorance! Dear God help me never to understand the painful iniquities of my own heart! Give me the blind certainty of Nathan Price in all my affairs. Even if it costs me my family, my friends, my life.\\" One character who seems mind-numbingly stupid inhabits this space. And lives a life of bovine self-satisfaction.What keeps us from choosing to do the same is not as evident in the novel as it might be. Kingsolver chose instead to show us the miseries inflicted by bad political events. She made her protagonist almost as miserable from the political fallout of an evil dictator as from the sins of a live-in fundamentalist preacher. The story might have been more convincing if there were joy or even satisfaction to temper the pain of knowing. Yet Kingsolver denies her protagonist any sense of joy and gives her only a rare glimpse of satisfaction. To make it otherwise she'd have had to back off from her second goal.The goal was laudible, but the book seems less effective for the choice. It's sometimes hard to remember that for a message to be persuasive it cannot simply be right, it has to be heard in a way that changes perceptions and practices. It has to offer good choices. How difficult it can be to hear the message we preach with the ears of our audience."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"&quot;I spent 30 years waiting for the wisdom and maturity to write this book,&quot; Ms. Kingsolver writes in her introduction. This is the same introduction in which she confesses to never having been to the Congo. Trendy-lefty themes, cardboard characters, meandering plot, too many voices.

The last couple of pages made me cry, made me feel about the people I've known and who have died - sisters, parents, friends.But I wonder about this book and some others I've read recently - Chocolat by Joanne Harris, The English Passengers. All rightly criticising colonialism and 19th C evangelcism (religious and scientific). Alan Garner's &quot;Strandloper&quot; picks up on the same zeitgeist. Problem for me is that the Christian characters are depicted as so thick, feeble, insensitive - basically one-dimensional. Unwitting servants of Western Imperialism.What doesn't come over is the joy of Spanish Fiestas, the loyalty to local deities (&quot;Virgins&quot;), the sense that people could live with the Catholic Church's nonsense if their local worship was acknowledged. These books are about problems of Calvinism, Methodism - the protestant version of The Enlightenment. And the rightful questioning of Western exploitation/justification.So my take on all this is this - some heartfelt and beautiful books about colonialism and how bad it was, but missing out on home-grown beauty and mystery (see Strandloper) (The British Isles is a colonised location, after all!)"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is by far one of the best and most compelling books in a long time."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This Novel was the best one that I've read all year! It has it all. It appeared to be researched very well...as it gave me such an awesome realization of another country. It also, brought to my mind that some people go too far with pushing their beliefs onto others. Entertaining, endearing, and fascinating. A must read for all!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book was horrible! I felt like I was being preached at the entire time. I was disappointed in all of the character's personalities because they were so dull and they never stood up for themselves. I was so put off by this book that I dreaded reading it, but I kept at it because everyone said it was good. I also had read other books by the author and loved those, but I found that this one did not measure up at all. I couldn't believe that someone would publish a book so incredibally awful"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I am still reading this book and enjoying it immensely. My comment is to others reviewing the book or thinking about reviewing it. Please don't divulge events such as a death of a character. It's rather like hearing someone give away the end of a movie. I have yet to reach a point where a character dies in the Poisonwood Bible but thanks to a few reviews, I already know she does. I can appreciate enthusiasm from reviewers but feel this kind of review borders on spoiling another's reading experience."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Let me start by saying I tend to like the Oprah picks, it's a great way to read books that I'm not familiar with or normaly wouldn't read. However, I really had to force my way through this one. I found the story compelling and loved how it's told through each woman's voice. Kingsolver is so descript in her vision of the Congo you almost feel the symptoms of malaria. That said, this is not a feel good read, bright spots are few and far betweeen. I kept thinking &quot;when are they going to catch a break?&quot;, to no avail. And there are some lulls that seem to exist to make this an &quot;epic&quot;. I would give it 3 1/2 stars based on the voice of Adah-how about a sequel just based on her life."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I chose to read Poisonwood Bible because it was listed as an Oprah Book Club selection. Having never read a book from her list before, I was intrigued by what she would be recommending to her readers. I was immediately impressed.What I found most interesting is the fact that this book had not one, but 5 different narrators. I felt that writing the various chapters with different voices was a great way to develop the 5 characters, who were united in some way in how they felt about the father of the family, a baptist minister stubborn in his need to save the African peoples from damnation.The book is written on an epic scale, spanning several decades as we watch the 4 daughters change and grow, created by the life they live in the Belgian Congo. The four daugthers and their mother go through devastating tragedies during their years in Africa, and what they see and experience shapes them into the adults they later become.I think this book is a &quot;must-read&quot;, but be warned - it's over 500 pages if I recall properly."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I was reluctant to pick up this book when it first came out because it had the word Bible in the title, but was finally convinced when I started work at the Museum of Natural History on a scientific expedition to the Congo that took place in 1910. The book helped me realize what Africa must have been during the days when it was known as &quot;the Dark Continent&quot; Unfortunately, the book threw me off with several important factual errors, such as the date of discovery of the okapi, with which it starts. The narrative quickly drew me back in and I found myself unable to put it down."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I generally do not read fiction, however, this book ranks among my all-time favorites. Kingsolver's ability to portray several different characters in their own voice so separately and distinctly is remarkable (I vehemently disagree with the &quot;white devil&quot; reviewer - perhaps this person didn't clearly understand the book). The story spans time and personalities seamlessly and effortlessly. &quot;Poisonwood Bible&quot; is one of those books that draws you in, holds your attention, and stays with you. In many ways, Kingsolver's excellent writing style and ability to weave a unique and thought-provoking story is reminscent of John Irving's later work. Kingsolver is truly one of our most gifted American writers."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The most remarkable aspect of this wonderful book is that it is told in the voices of several different females...all moving and authentic. I hope Oprah's choice of it brings Barbara Kingsolver the full, wide recognition she deserves. The book will change your view of the Congo forever."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I couldn't put this book down. Not only was it an astonishing story, the style of Kingsolver's writing was wonderful. Wry, touching, laugh-out-loud funny in parts, I learnt a lot about the history of the Belgian Congo as well. Fantastic book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The best book I have read in years. Unlike a lot of other reviewers I found the early chapters a struggle but it really came alive in the latter half. I think this was because Kingsolver's writing style, while unrelentingly beautiful, takes a little getting used to after reading Stephen King. I found Leah's story particularly compelling. The whole thing really made me think about the world beyond the Western one. I finished it a week ago and I still can't put it out of my brain."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Gritty and exhausting, this was a beautifully written book. Included tragedy, despair, but also humor and even some victory over pain and suffering. The fact that my book club members had so many different opinions and interpretations proves that the book is complex and compelling on many dimensions."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"this is the best book i have read in ages. why do you think the father never speaks directly to us?"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Five stars for artistic merit ... I found the language in this book superb, although a lot of the imagery reminded me of a bad dream and there seemed to be little beauty in Kingsolver's Congo. On the other hand, I found myself wondering about Kingsolver's agenda in writing this book. It was a pretty thorough put-down of Christianity, Capitalism and the United States. In the concluding chapter, I believe the voice of the serpent in Eden becoming the voice of the Congo becoming the voice of Ruth May was a New Age exaltation of the occult."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book is at the top of my list. I loved it! The Poisonwood Bible is suspensful, heartbreaking, uplifting, and witty. I couldn't wait to turn the page."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Poisonwood Bible follows the Price family, as they etch out a living in the Congo, (later known at Zaire) while the father Nathan attempts to convert the populace to christianity.The majority of the story is told by the family's four daughters, with brief narratives from the mother. While intially the daughters are a little hard to tell apart (aside from my favourite Adah) all the girls develop into their own unique characters as the story is told.Not a cheap drama, The Poisonwood Bible, is a narrative that takes its time. Rather than having dramatic tension thrust upon us, the cracks slowly develop as the story goes on, until all hell breaks loose. All authors could learn a thing or two about foreshadowing from this novel.The prose is very poetic and strong, and makes your typical bestselling thriller sound like children's writing. The imagery of the Congo is very strong, and we get a vivid sense of each characters' experience in the harsh country.Towards the end of the story, things drag somewhat and the narrative becomes mired in political rhetoric. Its not too bad, but the novel is long, and some readers may find themselves a little disapointed in the slow paced final 200 pages or so.Nonetheless, The Poisonwood Bible has many lessons to teach about christianity, politics and family. The narrative is a joy to follow (esp my maingirl Adah) and the novel is nothing short of powerful."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book was such agood read that I ordered it for a friend before I had even finished it. The way Kingsolver is very conversational. Makes you want to hear the rest of the story."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I read this book 10 years ago, and I still think back to it often. Barbara Kingsolver has an incredible way with words and weaves together such a touching story that I keep coming back to it, especially now that I am a mother. I enjoyed the Bean Trees/Pigs in Heaven a bit more, but this story is still amazing. I wish Kingsolver would write a few more fictions! She is definitely on my top-5 author list."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book begins a little slow, but is really worth those few pages to get to the meat of the story. Getting inside the heads of these characters was great and the overall book was fantastic!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"In the early 60s Nathan Price decides to take his wife and four daughters to the Congo convinced that he will lead the natives to Jesus Christ. He is an unflinching preacher who believes in the wrath of God. The Congo proves to be a harder life than any of them could have imagined. None of them will ever be the same.The story is told from the perspective of the five women. Orleana- mother, Rachel- vain oldest daughter, Leah- gifted survivor, Adah- gifted cripple who has a unique view of the world, Ruth May- baby of the family.Few books have changed the way I see the world. This one did. Not only did I learn a lot about the politics of Africa, but I got to see it from an African perspective. It was a whole new way of looking at the world.While it's not a quick read, Poisonwood Bible is worth the time."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I just recommended this book to a friend looking for something really good to read. I would put this book in my top ten of all time. I took a chance on it because it was recommended by Oprah even though I felt I had no interest in the subject matter of a missionary family in Africa. I am so glad I did. Kingsolver is a great writer and kept me mesmerized throughout the whole book. I am an avid reader so it is a delight when I find a book this excellent. I cannot convince my husband to read it because of the subject matter, so if you are turning your nose up because of that, take a chance on this book and dive right in. You will be so happy you read it; it is an experience worth having. Power Path to Love"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book rates up there with some of the best I have ever read. I only wish I could find even one a year of this quality."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I love this novel--it is written from several different points of view (each daughter) and is very well done. It inspired my friend, Grace Deters, to publish her memoirs, which are very similar to Poisonwood Bible but they are TRUE. If you want to read a true story of a missionary daughter, read Divine Betrayal!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"this is an extraordinary book. kingsolver is a talented writer, and her prose enhances (and does not distract from) the fascinating plot. i loved it from beginning to end. it is highly engrossing and entertaining, but also makes you think. i would've loved to have read this book in school."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I enjoyed this book to the very end. I also learned alot about the Congo and the people. I am very satisfied that I took the time to read this book. Hearing the story from so many different characters made the depth that much better. I feel that Nathan Price should of taken more time to get to know the Congo people. He tried to bring them into his world. I feel the little things we have are still the most important. Family should always be #1 in any situation. It is hard to understand why a man would put his family at such great risk especially on purpose. I wish that Orleanna would have gotten all the girls out sooner instead of later. But the paths each character chose to take seemed to have turned out for them. Barbara Kingsolver did an amazing job. I'm looking forward for the next journey."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I recently hurt my back and was on complete bedrest. A friend recommended this book to me, and I'm glad she did. This is a real page-turner."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I read voraciously, but live in a country where English reading material is not easy to find. Therefore I treasure my books and try to ration them out across several days. But my mom sent me &quot;Poisonwood Bible&quot; and I barely put it down... and it's a long book! Since reading it, I must have mentioned it to every person I've seen who is a native English speaker!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible describes the life of Nathan and Orleanna Price and their daughters Rachel, Leah, Adah, and Ruth May; missionaries in the African Congo. It's a wonderful book that lets you see through the eyes of the five women in the family. The storyline will leave you amazed at the hardships they faced and how they overcame them. Overall it's a wondeful book, but don't read it unless you're willing to finish it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book has wonderful writing and characterization. The author, however, tries too hard to fit in her agenda, which has interesting parts, but is too broad. This is one of Kingsolver's main flaws, but most of her books are more about the characters and less about the message. All of her books are good, but this one is my least favorite."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The female characters were beautifully evoked and I felt engaged by them. However, the author's insistence on incorporating her personal agenda became overwhelmingly irritating and eventually threw me out of the novel."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Was figuring on a probable five-star rating here til the last third or so of the novel, which I found incredibly disappointing. Everything I was loving about it--the people of the village, the snakes, the ants--all things wonderfully &quot;congo-ish&quot;-- abruptly ended after the adorable little girl (whom I also loved) died. It was all down hill from there. How the surviving members of the Price family go on with their lives after their time in the Congo, each in extremely different ways, is interesting stuff, but not as fascinating as living and struggling in the Congo. Added to that, I think the storytelling itself became quite poor. I felt myself becoming more and more distanced from the characters as I got closer and closer to the end. By the end, I didn't really care about them at all. But I loved the first half!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"&quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; is a powerful and moving novel. It explores the depths of the problems that Africa has faced and is still facing. Kingsolver has written a very different novel here than her others, and yet what makes it different is what makes it so good. This novel is powerful on many levels. The narration is shared by the women of the Price family, each with their very different voice and take on life. While this book has its emotionally difficult moments, I believe that the overall message of hope and redemption makes it all worth it. I would recommend this novel to anyone with an open mind who is willing to be taken on one families journey through the heart of Africa."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is Kingsolver's best novel. It's a masterpiece with none of the uncertainties of some of her earlier books. She has found an issue that she explores with great knowledge, compassion, realism, imagination, enthusiasm, zest, humor, sorrow and a personal touch. The story is involving, the characters are believable and politics are presented as they occur in reality -- integrated with the people's lives and having a sometimes tragic, sometimes positive impact. The novel also settles the question, once and for all, whether Ms. Kingsolver is a &quot;serious&quot; writer or not. She has shown here that she is not afraid to take on an issue of epic proportions, and I am sure she has enlightened many and infuriated some with this brave, wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Having been an English teacher for 20 years and spending half my entire life with my nose in a book, I was thoroughly impressed at how well and intricately written this book is.......it was the only time I cried and sobbed aloud while I read......"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"&quot;Forgive me, Africa, according to the multitudes of thy mercies&quot; (525)Barbara Kingsolver's novel, The Poisonwood Bible, is a powerfully, moving account of the Congo's struggle for independence from Belgium rule during the 1960's and the political corruption that followed. Told through the voice and experience of the Price family, who are missionaries in Africa, one can come to understand more fully the rape of the Congo's natural resourses and the oppression suffered by the people of color at the hands of nations, including America, with a lust for greed. Kingsolver has a keen insight to the plight of the African people, their unique culture, and the political evil that taunts them."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"In her novel The Poisonwood Bible, Kingsolver presents a profound look into a dysfunctional family. Kingsolver follows the family's story by using a multiple female narrator presentation. This form of presentation allows the reader to more thoroughly understand each character. This thorough character development is one of Kingsolver's strengths. While Kingsolver tends to wax prolix, the power of the novel is not lost. That Kingsolver has lived in Africa as part of a missionary family lends credibility to the novel. Also, the political situtation is accurately portrayed and incorporated into the family's struggle to survive."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Being a Christian as well, I think you have completely misunderstood Kingsolver's intentions for this book. I agree that this book presents religion and politics in the Congo accurately. However, I would disagree with you claim that there are no respectable characters. Although Nathan, an over-zealous missionary, may be detremental to the Christian Evangelical, there are others that can be redeeming to the Christian faith. Brother Fowels, another missionary, found a way to relate to the Congolese and be succesful. Never does Kingsolver make me feel bad about being a Christian or feel the need to apoligize for my faith. All the women leave their experience with a new-found spirituality, although not over-zealous Christians. I enjoyed this book, including its Biblical format. This book brings people to see how hard a missionaries life really is, and just how trying an experience it can be."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"A heartful story of the maturation of five girls during their stay in the Congo, Barbara Kingsolver's The Poisonwood Bible demonstrates the plight of missionaries in Africa at the time of Congo's independence. The novel chronicles the lives of five daughters and their mother Orleanna as they strive to survive in a country where they are considers outsiders to both the language and customs of the Congolese where the father, Nathan Price, a religious zealot, is striving to save the souls of the locals. It is the story of personal evolution, for both the characters and the Congo. Orleanna's decision to free herself from the oppression that she has been subject to for most of her life parallels Congo's desire for inependence from its father country of Belgium. Although the novel gets off to a slow start, it slowly picks up pace and Kingsolver's ability to write from each character's point of view allows the reader to feel empathy for the mother and sympathy for the daughters while demonstrating how their experiences in the Congo had a significant impact on the rest of their lives."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Four stars to this story of a baptist families struggle deep in Congo. Kingsolver creates very in depth and real portraits of each of the seven main characters, and really cuts to the heart of the struggles that missionaries of Africa went through in the middle of the 20th century (and perhaps still do). Although the book could have ended one hundred pages before, the extra pages provide an insight and conclusion to the life after the Congo. Kingsolver has created a classic work incorporating politics and emotions in a well wound story."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kingsolver's THE POSIONWOOD BIBLE, is like nothing she's written before. Previously, I admired her for the wit and easy gait of her other novels and short stories, and the multifaceted knowledge she displays in her essays. THE POSIONWOOD BIBLE blew me away with its intense characterization and clearly researched (but feeling all the while inhabitable) Africa.Initially slow going, THE POSIONWOOD BIBLE picks up a third of the way through and becomes a heartwrenching, poetic tale of a family torn apart by religion, naivete, and cultural upheaval. Kingsolver's rich characterization of the four women, and her amazing gift at relaying the story in several distinct voices, makes for an enriching and rewarding read. What I specifically liked about this novel, was the fact that not only was I engrossed by the characters and the story itself, but I also felt like I learned a great deal about Africa. I think when someone tells a story that reaches out and grabs you by the lapels, and also gives you the opportunity to learn something about culture and history, without making it feel like a seminar, you've got the makings of a classic."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is an intersting book. You must read the entire book to get the true actual meaning f the book. The book reminds me of &quot;How The Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents,&quot; by: Julia Alvarez. The only difference is the book goes forward in time. Each of the 4 girls and their mother,Orleanna, Rachel, Leah, Adah, and Ruth May have different perspective on how life is in the Belgian Congo. This creative formula makes the book even better. The only downfall of the book is the mother has a boring perspective."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"To tell you the truth, i didn't like this book very much at all! Everyone had been talkign about how good it was, but when i FINALLY got involved in the story and could manage to keep the characters in order it wasn't that exciting. It was neat to see the different points of views from the characters, but it took you a while to find out what their perspective was on everything, and then go back to the story to put the pieces together. When you do finally get involved it isn't that bad of a book, and in the end whne they tell you what the daughters are doing when they are fully grown, it is funny to see how they have changed. The plot has a lot of twists that keep you involved, but you NEED to be constantly reading the book to get everything straight! The main plot was a good idea if it didn't always go into a million different directions!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I am a big fan of Barbara Kingsolver, and once I &quot;got into&quot; this book I could not stop listening. I have the book, and began to read it, however, once I saw that they had this book on tape at my local library I checked it out. The book was slow to bein with and took time to engulf my thoughts. However, once I would put it down, I felt the need to read more. Therefore, listing to the tape, was a way to sit back relax and ENJOY. I would highly recommend the book, but for the reader who's eyes need a break, try listening to the novel. It will capture your heart and attention.Molly R.

Anyone of these characters could have been real, because it was that good and that well written. There are a lot of truths in this made up book and I think the ending was truly fitting.

Kingsolver is becoming rod my favorite authors. There's always a lesson with a great interpersonal story woven in."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible starts off with a Baptist Missionary dragging his wife and four daughters to the Congo. The first 300 (roughly) pages are all snippets of the hardships the girls of this family suffer both at the hands of their strict father, and the misunderstandings that come of living in a different culture. These pages are thought-provoking and occasionally humorous. Then the Congo experiences a change of government and all over the country white people are being killed in riots. Though the women of the household are begging to leave the country, the father insists they stay in the dangerous environment to continue trying to convert the native tribe. Of course the father inevitably makes the elders angry, and the family's situation becomes even more desperate.Whereas the beginning of the book is very interesting, the last hundred pages are just too much. The characters become rather odd because they didn't change as they got older; none of them learned anything or came to terms with what happened. They all end up turning away from the religion that their father had pounded into their heads. The main lesson appears to be that if your husband comes back from war insane, you should divorce him before it ruins your life.This book's ending leaves you feeling haunted and depressed, though you do learn some interesting facts about the African history and culture. I would certainly not recommend this book to anyone who does not enjoy literary fiction."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Books like The Poisonwood Bible are not usually my cup of tea, and I resisted at first when my wife tried to convince me to read it. She was insistent, however, and I reluctantly picked the book up if for no other reason than to have a little quiet at home. My plan was to politely read a couple of chapters and then tell my wife that I tried but it wasn't anything I could get into. So much for my plan. By the time I finished the first chapter I knew that I would be reading the entire novel. The Poisonwood Bible is a pretty good story, but the strength of the book lies in the writer's style and in the individual characters. With different chapters written from different viewpoints, Kingsolver really brings the characters to life in a way that few other authors are able to. I ended up reading this book in just a couple of days, and when I was finished I immediately thanked my wife for this rare treat. If you've read this book you know how engrossing it can be.

When you finish the book, it will be as if you're leaving your friends behind. I've never read a book with such great character development!

I lost sleep devouring this book, and it still sticks in my memory, more than a year later. It's great. Read it and join the modern era."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kigsolver is very eloquent in her endeavor to capture the audience with beautiful prose. She tempts you to continue reading. The first 150 pages of this novel were somewhat boring. The last 150 pages of this novel were also somewhat boring. If you can get passed the opening then you can really sink your teeth the real plot, which is getting this group of women through their demented fathers attempt to make everyone else suffer for some slight he feels he committed almost 20 years beforehand. I enjoyed the book overall, but next time I'll read the condensed version!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible works on many levels to educate and entertain. The author successfully writes in four completely different voices -- the voices of Nathan Price's wife and three daughters. This is also a book that evolves through its telling. At the beginning, the acts of father Nathan Price dominate the course of action and the book seems to revolve around his mistakes in evangelizing in the Congo during the late 1950's and early 1960's. Price arrives determined to push his missionary vision on an otherwise content African community. He brings his family along with him, and never allows their feelings or needs to get in the way of his mission. By the end, though, the voices of each daughter have emerged and the father falls into silence. Nathan loses his church and dies alone, separated from his family and apparently lost. The experience changes each daughter's life, though, and the second half of the book focuses on the diverse paths they choose in reaction to a singular event -- the death of the youngest daughter to a snake bite. Steinbeck created small stories within his novels that made for simple parables to understanding his themes - the turtle crossing the road in the Grapes of Wrath, for example. In the same way, Kingsolver tells simple stories with the intent of revealing deeper insights. In one, for example, Price's daughters learn to control the fire in their homemade Congolese oven. The daughters burn a valuable egg when they cook too soon after starting the fire. Their mother, Orleanna Price, spells out the lesson: for a fire (and also independent African republics or children) to grow, you must permit it the chance to burn hot and on its own before trying to harness it as a controllable force."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The first two-thirds of this book is beautifully written. I love the way Kingsolver created unique voices for each of the characters and told the story through their eyes. However, the book takes a disappointing turn during the last third. Rachel's character turns into a parody of herself, and Leah's self-righteous and predictably PC diatribe becomes tiresome at best. It struck me that Kingsolver was projecting a fantasy of middle-class, baby-boomer-style radicalization onto both Leah and Orleanna. Toward the end of the book, Leah's voice started sounding like the author was preaching at the reader about first world imperialism in Africa--not that she doesn't have a good point, but preaching about politics is a great way to ruin a novel."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"It's not very often that a fiction books comes along that so beautifully illustrates the real world. This book is well-written, insightful joy to read that employs excellent literary techniques."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"A novel rich in its own lesson -- the power of language in religion, family systems and in writing! Characters and story teach us so much! Abuse of religion, family power, cultural power --all illustrated through the beautiful use of language and character in a setting that is interesting, rich and gripping. The message of this book translates across the culture in which it is set and into our own if we are willing to see it everywhere! Wonderful!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"After reading this book I have been thinking a lot about green mamba snakes, driver ants, malaria and all the other killer animals, insects and diseases that reside in Africa. This book made me thankful that I live in the land of twinkies and wonderbread."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I have been disappointed with Oprah Book Club choices in the past. I was not disappointed with this book. I read this novel after returning from a research trip in Kenya. The historical references are fascinating and are able to give the reader a historical perspective on how Africa as a continent was and still is suffering. Many of the problems the characters experience are still true 40 years later."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The depth, quiet humor, and fabulous writing of this book make it fascinating all the way through!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book was pretty bad. To summarize the plot, it's an attempt to write a story of the experiences of a missionary family that isn't quite up to God's calling. I write \\"an attempt\\" because the characters, especially the father, were so stereotyped as to be laughable. It's clear that Nathan Prince is there as a whipping boy for Kingsolver to rail against cultural imperialism in the Belgian Congo. But wouldn't a more realistic character have been more effective? I am deeply bothered by the Christian missions model in colonial Africa too. I abhor colonialism in general. But I know people whose mothers and fathers were in the same roles as Nathan Prince, and even the bad ones were nothing like this. Even the worst ones I could imagine would be nothing like this, because they would still be real people, with gifts and faults and the whole package.I am all for sending a political message through fiction. But Kingsolver makes the mistake of being so obvious with her agenda that you keep thinking of the author rather than the characters. This gets worse the longer the book drags on. Those who strongly share the author's viewpoint may or may not like it, but no one who starts the book with a different point of view is going to be convinced by arguments like these.FWIW, I didn't like her writing style much either. Even if she had been an engaging writer, it wouldn't have overcome the heavyhanded style, but it would have been more entertaining."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Even the moderately interesting first half was way too long and repetitive; the author essentially told you in the first chapter what was going to happen, so it was just a question of how it was going to get there. It got there slowly.I was going to say it had the longest denouement I have ever read, but online reviewer &quot;Ellen&quot; expressed it better: &quot;page upon page of endless bla bla bla-ing&quot;"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I really really tried to like this novel. Barbara Kingsolver is one of my favorite authors and I've relished all of her previous writing. But this book was dreary in the extreme. I tried to force myself to read it but finally rebelled after about l00 pages. The family endures relentless pain, suffering, and misery. I don't mind heavy books (like &quot;Animal Dreams&quot;) but I don't submit myself to books about endless misery with no joy or hope. For a life-affirming book, try &quot;The Color of Water,&quot; a serious book but one that inspires and uplifts, rather than this dark and depressing tale."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Overall I found the book very intriguing. I was interested in the Price family, as I am fascinated by missionary stories. However, I think that Barbara Kingsolver shows obvious disdain for the Christian Religion, making the missionary husband (Nathan Price) the main obsticle in the way of the Price women's survival. It seems as though Ms. Kingsolver has generalized Christians as arrogant know-it-alls from the Bible Belt. It is obvious from the very beginning that the Price family (and particularly Nathan) are in for a rude awakening. In fact, towards the end of the novel I found that all the characters were turned off by the very thought of Christianity, associating it with their deranged father and husband they left behind in the Congo. This is the feeling I believe the authoress was trying to create in her readers. By all means, enjoy this book! I know I did, but keep in mind that Christianity is in fact skewed toward a negative light."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"While I found this book to be intriguing because of the setting, I also found it extremely disappointing in the picture it portrays of christians in the mission field. My pastor is head of the Foreign Mission Board for the Eastern Hemisphere and we always have missionaries visiting our church. They are always people who care about their families immensely and are answering a difficult call from the Lord. I have never met one that fit this horrid description of a man led by the Lord to evangelize others in foreign territory. While the character in the story had some life trauma's apparently causing him to become this unlikely zealot, it is very disturbing to cast this glow on people in the mission field. I am sorry I wasted the time to expect this book to improve. Oprah continues to choose literature that does not strengthen the body of Christ.In Georgia"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver is one of my favorite authors, but this one is my favorites! This is one of my top five life time favorite novels!!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Great book - I think Kingsolver's best. Really points out the arrogance of mankind and the impact we can have on others. A lot of insight into humankind, without being maudlin or trite. Made me laugh, made me cry, made me want to leave the world somehow a better place by being more understanding, tolerant and learning to listen."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book had some promise. It could have been good but I did not feel part of the story. The author was just telling the reader what happened. I like to know what the characters are experiencing inside as well as out. I lost interest in the first quarter of the book. I gave more than one star because the premise was good and the characters at least potentially were interesting."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I had just finished Tom Wolfe's masterpiece, &quot;A Man in Full&quot;, and wanted to read something that wouldn't be too big a letdown. I was therefore thrilled to find myself immersed in this emotionally gratifying, wonderfully written novel by Kingsolver.Although the author wears her politics on her sleeve, the tone doesn't become overly preachy and it prompted me to do further research on the history of the Congo. I love novels that teach as well as entertain. Missionaries don't fare particularly well, which may irritate some readers, but those that share the view that it takes a certain arrogance to tell a people that their centuries-old way of worship is wrong will applaud that sentiment here.An emotional journey."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Like most other readers/reviewers, I'm a big fan of Barbara Kingsolver's work and eagerly anticipated this book. Unlike those who did not like it compared to her other books, I valued most of the differences. This is her &quot;big one&quot; (as I heard Kingsolver call it in an interview) and it shows. We learn about more characters, we get a longer story, we get more involved with the political situation and see more political change. We learn more about how biological, social and political systems are intertwined. We get more and every page is an education. Her other books are all of these things, but shorter and less ambitious. Like the other books I couldn't put it down once I started reading it because of the story and characters, yes, but also because of what I learn. My only problem, because Kingsolver showed more of her political views, was the imbalance presented. I'm admittedly a novice in Congolese politics, and a sympathizer with the people's attempts toward independence. I just felt that I was reading a one-sided account and would have appreciated a little more balance to start my education.A terrific work. Thank you Barbara. As always, you're an inspiration and a teacher."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I think that Barbara Kingsolver must sit down and decide whether she is writing a novel or a political tract. It is not that I disagree in a fundamental way with her political beliefs. My problem is that she has them on her sleeve, or at least her character's sleeve, to such an extent that character development is truncated. Most of my friends do not agree with my politics. If either they or I were defined by our set of political beliefs, I would have no friends, and I have a good many close ones. Barbara Kingsolver is a gifted writer who starts with a good idea and creates believable characters and plots, but all too often gets bogged down in preaching at the reader through her characters. Certainly, Animal Dreams suffered from this and The Poisonwood Bible is all but sunk by it. Telling a story through five different childhood voices is a monumental task--perhaps really impossible--and I congratulate the author for trying at all."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I am an avid follower of Barbara Kingsolver's writing, and was thrilled by &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot;. Lately, it seems that books have become smaller, and one has little time to get to know the characters or to follow them as they develop over a long period of time. This book allow us to get to know the Price Family and how Nathan Price's rigid, abusive character and the events of the book shaped them into separate individuals.. I gained a great deal of knowledge of and respect for the history of Zaire, and was fascinated by Ms. Kingsolver's descriptions of village life. (I must read &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot;). My reservations about the writing have to do with Rachel's character after she becomes an adult. She seemed to be a characture of herself and I found her selfishness and self-indulgence a bit overdone. Ms. Kingsolver often seems to say what I think. Her statements are bold an straight forward, and her criticisms of religion and American political policy are persuasive. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"She writes with beauty and grace. Of all the characters, daughter Adah moved me the most. Her lyrical and profound insights rang true at every turn. I was pleasantly surprised to find history woven so seamlessly with fiction. I never felt lectured to, nor castigated. I am enriched by the reading."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver take on the central question in understanding the history of the U.S. and its imperialist foreign policy. The heart of the matter is the ideology of white (and male) supremacy and how this &quot;poison&quot; has brutalized people of color in this country and around the world. Starting with the basis of a fundamentalist, authoritarian, racist patriarch she examines the affect of this man and his ideology on his wife, his family and the people they encounter. The &quot;personal and political&quot; truly cannot be separated. She is to be commended for dealing so forthrightly with an issue that all of us who are white in this country should examine. Doing it through fiction in a way we can experience the emotions and personal development of the characters is challenging and ultimately rewarding."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I have been a fan of Barbara Kingsolver for some time now; but I was wholly unaware of what awaited me when I read this book. Her use of mulitple characters for her narrative was masterful. You feel the same thoughts, same confusion, and the same agony that her characters suffer through in their transformation from somewhat backwoodsy small town folk to uncomfortable citizens of Africa. This book actually changed my reading style -- I'm usually voracious in my appetite for reading. I try to read as many books as I can cram into my free time. But Kingsolver forces you to savor every word, and it's nice to stop and smell the roses for a change..."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Four years ago, after finishing Pigs in Heaven, I wrote Ms. Kinsolver telling her how much I enjoyed reading it and all her other great books and stories. She wrote back apologizing for the &quot;crummy form letter&quot; promising that it was a necessary evil so that she could devote time to writing her next book.Boy, was it ever worth it! I just finished The Poisonwood Bible and I'm thinking &quot;PULITZER&quot;!! It was simply marvelous. It had everything: a riveting plot line, thought provoking social and political commentary, terrific characters, humor, pathos, and even word games! It was quite an education.In particular, Rachel's character was brilliant. Her unintentional humor and malapropisms were needed between chapters of famine and flood. But she was also the representative of all of us who are either blind or apathetic to the havoc that our country wrought in other lands.Bravo, Ms. Kinsolver! I hope you've already started on your next novel!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I was thrilled when I found that Barbara Kingsolver, one of my favorite authors had written a new book. I was not disappointed. Kingsolvers' use of a missionary's need to control and conquer all around him gave the perfect juxtaposition for the struggles of the Congo. The self-rightousness and deep-seated anger of Nathan Price should cause all of us to step back and consider what we do in the name of God.....and how in our zealousness we treat others. The voices of the girls ring in my ears.....and the anguish of their lives in my heart."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Being a long time fan of Barbara Kingsolver, I have been eagerly awaiting the release of &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot;. Advance publicity made me aware it was not set in the southwestern United States like her other novels and I wondered if her wonderful style and use of language would translate as well in a new setting.My concerns were unfounded. Kingsolver writes about what she knows, and as she tells us in the author's notes, she spent time in the Congo as a child with her health care worker parents.&quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; is Kingsolver at her best. Her use of the five female characters as the alternating voices of the novel works beautifully. The reader experiences the events of the story through many different perspectives, the sum of which is a insightful look at life in a country that is effected by a harsh climate and extreme poverty complicated by interference from foreign governments. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good story accompanied by information that is thought provoking. It will make you appreciate the advantages we take for granted in the United States."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"A beautiful work of art, but with agendas - I had passed over this one due to hearing that it was anti-American, and sacrilegious, but am glad I finally decided to try it. It is a skillfully written account of the trials faced by a missionary's family (wife and 4 girls) in Africa. It is not anti -American, but is opposed to the kind of American policies we had after WWII, when we supported any third world strongman dictator who claimed to be anti-communist. Nor is the book anti-religious, but it is opposed to the kind of close-minded religion that attempts, through well meaning but wrongly taught missionaries, to impose inappropriate man-made rules on native cultures not well understood.The girls grow up in an environment so different from America, and the author leads us to know each one as they cope with Africa in their own way. The father, trying to earn forgiveness from God for cowardly behavior during the war, has one objective: to baptize as many children as possible in the crocodile infested river, a plan the natives firmly reject. The girls: a \\"dumb blond\\", a genius twin, her also genius but handicapped twin sister, and the little sister, who was eventually lost to a mamba snake, take turns telling the story as they see it. The spirit of the little sister provides the impressive and thought provoking ending.PS I came back to add a few words about the sister I fell in love with, Adah, the twin born with half a brain, leaving her crippled on the other side. But what she could do with that half a brain as it compensated for the lost other half! She memorized even faster than her normal twin, could read both forward and backward, learned several languages, amused herself with palindromes and by writing poems with forward and backword sentences, and finally recovered the full use of her rignt side and became a research doctor specializing in African viruses."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I seriously doubt an evangelical Baptist missionary would use a Bible that contained the Maccabees books with \\"The Verse\\" he made his daughters write as punishment. It did help tie up endings but is not realistic to see a Baptist reading Maccabees, which are found in Catholic Bibles, not protestant Bibles. But then The Poisonwood Bible is a work of fiction."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The editorial reviews and the other 1409 reader reviews provide as much commentary on this remarkable book as one might want. Needless to say, I enjoyed the story. It operates at several levels just like life. You might dislike some characters but they all seem real to me, sharply etched. You might not like what they say, it can be provocative, thought provoking. You might even imagine the story to be true. I can.As I reread the story, I find new aspects, not necessarily intended by the author, but ones that result from the interaction of the story and the life I know. If you enjoy deep literature, you will probably enjoy this book. If you are a scientist, as is the author, you will be pleasantly reminded that some scientists write extraordinarily well. The descriptions of the natural world are noticeably precise which alone separates this book from the average contemporary novel.If, like me, you find the narrative sometimes difficult, especially child Adah's, I recommend an audio version."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Go to Africa in the 1960s and live it through the eyes of 5 women."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Read this book.

The book is not just a great read, but also a hystorical and geographical lesson that you will appreciate learning. Within the story, there is hate, greed, and love (the odd kind). The major flaw, in my opinion, is the way the story is concluded because it makes the story \\"seem\\" a little more \\"fictional\\" (I'm not exactly sure how to put it), yet the rest of the story seemed very captivating as if it were a true story, and everything could possibly have happened. The ending seemed to just kill the tone of the whole thing."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Popular American 50s culture clashes violently and fatally with an upheaving Belgian Congo in this masterful work by Kingsolver. While using a Baptist missionary family to display how lives are changed by a radically new environment, the underlying author's messages about colonialism, religion, and family values are indelibly impressed upon the reader's soul. The rape of a virgin African wilderness by a consciousless, impersonal European power is blatantly shown and condemned. The effect upon each individual of the country, from the inhabitants of the European-named cities to the subsistence farmers in the remote villages, each is drastically changed by faceless, rich, white, foreign governments who selfishly steal the resources of a country still searching for its own identity. Read this novel for a deeper insight into how the other half lives. Two enthusiastic thumbs up, fun for the whole family."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"What was it like in the Congo in 1960? Barbara Kingsolver's novel of a missionary family gives the reader an idea. The family consisting of the Reverend, his wife and 5 daughters go to the Congo without sanction by his church in order to bring religion to the natives. The difference in cultures is stunning, and something that people who have never thought about going to Africa may never have thought of. The story is built around real events during the Congo revolution for independence. The writing is wonderful - each of the daughters has a section describing the events that were occuring in that era, and each daughter writes very distinctively and around the age group that you would expect.I didn't hate this book, but it isn't one of my favorites. It has, however, peaked my interest about what happend in the Congo in the 60's and before. This has led me to order several other books on the Congo."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"If you don't like to study history or politics but wish you were more conversant in both, this is a good read.

This story takes a very hard look at Christianity and Politics, and shows how a modern American family fairs, when faced with the hardships of an uncivilised and unforgiving Congo jungle. I found the book very hard to \`get into' and halfway through the book, found I was enjoying the story, but it didn't set me alight with enthusiasm. The second half of this glorious story however, blew me away. The maturing characters, the haunting memories of the family, a mothers grief, all were so beautifully written, I had to read passages over and over again to savour the phrases and paragraphs. A brilliant and intelligent novel."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"beautiful, beautiful book. i have read it over five times and still love it. kingsolvers best work."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This compelling and brilliant work by the gifted Barbara Kingsolver stands stylistically alongside Faulkner's *The Sound and the Fury.* Told from the separate viewpoints of a mother and her four daughters who follow their missionary husband/father to the Congo, the story unfolds with slow suspense, like a flower that can't quite catch a coy sun on a variably cloudy day. It is alternately and simultaneously a tale of self-destruction, coping, the death of innocents and devils, and redemption. Kingsolver is a master storyteller with the power to rivet attention so completely that while you are reading her, airplane turbulence, the need for sleep, and even a lover's touch can go unnoticed."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I TOTALLY WAS ENTHRAWED by this book! I could not wait to read the entire book. It was well written and although she claims this to be fiction ... it could not be any closer to the TRUTH! My 3 daughters and myself lived a life nearly IDENTICAL to what she had written. ...My daughters read this book as well and they were able to interject their own feelings about a situation such as the book described. Thus they were able to have an open conversation about having such UNCARING overly pompous father in their life.I felt like Barbara Kingsolver had seen my life and wrote it word for word. Her ability to see and describe the FEELINGS of the characters was REMARKABLE! Not to mention how INCREDABLY accurate the psychological aspects were illustrated. I highly encourage anyone that is battling religious or social abuse to read this. Sometimes it is just better to see a possible outcome of a situation (such as the one this book offers) to be able to see where you don't have to go.

As I told my parents story after story about my time spent with the native peoples during the ride back from the airport, my mom kept saying how similar this book was to my experiences. After reading it, I understood what she meant.Reading this book took me back to Africa and my many late night discussions with a few devout Christians on the trip. It was amazing how our individual views were so mirrored by the views by the girls in The Poisonwood Bible. It was as if Kingsolver had spent time on our trip doing research. This book is a must read for anyone who is either for or against missionary work, as well as anyone who enjoys immersing themselves in native cultures during their travels. It is full of history and controversy, and is deeply thought provoking.

The story begins in 1959, when the family first sets out from the United States into the wilderness of the Belgian Congo. Nathan Price, his family, and his overly confident personality land themselves into a tragic turmoil of ignorance, dogmatism, and perseverance. At the same time, the Belgian Congo was adapting from their own struggle for independence. Ultimately, both groups of people adapted to the situations in unique ways.Character: Orleanna is the mother of four daughters; Rachel, Leah, Adah, and Ruth May. Because her husband was controlling and strong-willed, whatever the father ordered was carried out. Because of his perseverance, the lives of the family were put into jeopardy, and at that same point, the perseverance of Orleanna ceased to exist. She packed her bags and moved away with her children, which eventually separated the rest of the family as well. She was the one who made the changes with good intentions for everybody except for the father. She also represents the mourner of the story. She takes care of a lot of the problems, but also takes the burden for many of the bad situations.Style: The book takes on many of the characters' point of views. The reason for that is so that the reader can engage in a fully described, fully detailed story. It is depicted from almost every perspective, each character showing her individual interpretation of the situations. Every person had something in common, however: they weren't enjoying themselves in the harsh circumstances. Each perspective was a hardship.Language: A lot of the wording in the book is descriptive and detailed down to each individual character, including the consideration for the vocabulary limitations or advantages. The learning/limited understanding of the local language of the Congolese.Overall, this is a very realistic, creative story of life, death, and the &quot;Strangling their own kin in a struggle for...light (Page5)&quot;"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poison Wood Bible written by Barbara Kingsolver, was beautifully written and illustrated with words, well described characters, and plot. The characters were illustrated in a way that made them easy to picture but at the same time hard to fully understand. The plot was full of rich stories inside stories and one adventure after another, bringing in partially true stories of political problems of the time. The language was bright and colorful, fitting each segment of the book with permission. The book had a story to go with every word which made it enjoyable and interesting.Plot: The plot of PWB was well thought out and well described, never a bit vegue. The mix of fiction with non-fiction was inspiring, making a story that is completely fake have a true political problem that was from that time in history. The story of man vs. nature and man vs. man gave the plot a gripping feel to it that the reader could really understand and get into. The is probably one of the best ever written.Language: The language in the book was vivid and colorful. Each word was an analogy to something that was happening at the time in the book, and each word was a story. The use of Congolese was wonderful and colorful, again painting it&#65533;s own picture to go with the story. The author did a wonderful job to pick words that fit with precision into the story.Characters: Each character ranging from Ruth May to Nathen, and Pascal to Tata Anatol, had been described down to the last detail. Each character was completely different from the next even Adah and Leah the twins. Leah being a follower of her father and Adah read and writing in palindromes gave the book a unique twist. The rage of the father was insane and scary. Ruth May has a hidden demon with in her that has portrayed her as a demonic child, even though this is not evident right away the child does say many things that are disturbing. The was kind and learned Anatole, vain Rachel, unhappy Orleana, and all the other natives to the congo with there unique ideas, bodies and unique way of talking. There has never been a book were the characters, even the minor ones, have been so well thought through.Style: The style of the book was what helped everything along in the story of the family. The way Kingsolver had everything in the book detailed to a point where it could not be detailed anymore was a great way to make her book. The way it was written with narrations from each of the daughters and the mother was new and very interesting although it would have been nice to have the fathers narration in parts. All together the style was interesting and unique keeping the reader interested."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Overall, I thought that the Poisonwood Bible had a great plot, although I thought that the beginning was slow. It would have been nice to have a background on the Price family living in the US. It also would have been nice to see their reactions to their father's demands. I thought that each character in the book was excellently portrayed. No character was the same as another, and their emotions and feelings were obvious and realistic. I enjoyed the author's writing style. Although, sometimes it was boring, especially in the beginning. Sometimes she was too descriptive, and other times, she was not descriptive enough."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible, by Barbara Kingsolver, is the story of a missionary family traveling and living in the Congo during the time of its independence. The story is told from the women in the family's point of view as they grow up and experience this new culture. Their lives intertwine with that of the new Congo as they become involved with the people and events that shape the future of the Congo, as well as the futures of the Price family.The language of The Poisonwood Bible is what stood out most. Its beautifully crafted imagery made this a book worth reading. Ms. Kingsolver strung sentences together in such a way that it created perfect pictures in your mind of the Congo, the people, and the places. She switches styles depending on whose point of view she is writing from. For example, with Adah, the language is very observatory, and profound. In contrast, Ruth May, the five year old, is written in a very simple, inquisitive style. The language of the whole book makes the action around it so clear and easy to understand. Language aids in making the book a piece of art, rather then just a book.The characters of The Poisonwood Bible are incredibly complex and contradictory, just like people in real life. The characters are very different from each other, and each has a distinct personality and thought process that Ms. Kingsolver creates for the reader. They have flaws, like every human being, and make wrong choices that affect their lives. The characters do not all have a happy ending, but realistically their lives turn out according to decisions they make. Each character acts her age, having genuine thoughts and feelings a girl or woman of their age would have. The characters also interact believably, and as a family, relate as truthfully as a real family would under the circumstances. Overall, the characters were well built, especially their thought process, which really created their personalities.The style of The Poisonwood Bible is very wordy and description based. It focuses more on feelings then action; in fact there is little or no action to speak of. It is much more psychological then anything else, and explores the workings of everyone's mind, and how they react to the world around them. It is told from first person perspective, but with many different main characters. The book is very slow-paced, with no fast action or rapid storylines. It is something one must concentrate while reading, as it is a very complex book with many facets and stories going on at the same time. To sum the style of The Poisonwood Bible up, one would say it is exceedingly verbose and character-centered.The plot is centered on the Price family in the Congo. Nathan Price tries vainly to convert the indigenous people to Christianity, while his family deals with the ensuing culture and psychological reverberations. The subplot deals with the Congo and its struggle for independence from Belguim, which mirrors the women of the Price family's fight to disconnect themselves from the authoritative, abusive Nathan Price. The story chronicles their lives from the time they enter the Congo, full of hope and possibility, to when they leave it, minus two family members, and as completely different people. It then proceeds to show where the Price family ends up, scattered across the globe. At times the plot can be terribly slow and uninteresting, but then it picks up again, and in general, the plot was enjoyable though long-winded."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Plot: the main plot was fairly straight forward, but many plots on top of that. It was an exciting plot that kept my attention. It was a lot about emotions and family dynamics and those were sort of hard to read.Style: it was way too descriptive but very interesting. She described every detail about the Congo, which made me feel more connected, but slowed down the reading processLanguage: there was mostly straight forward language until it came to Adah I had to just ignore some of the things she said because I didn't get what they meant. That language fit perfectly for Adah because that is really how she is.Characters: the characters were very developed so I felt like I knew them personally. Most of the characters seemed neither male nor female which let guys connect with them as well as girls.all together it was a good read but takes a long time, even if you could read it quickly you would'nt get as much out of it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I had to write this review for class, and it wasn't meant to be absolute perfection. i hope you enjoy...Plot-A Christian family goes to the Congo, to spread Christianity. But they run into problems along the way, and have to deal with the hardships of daily life in the Congo. It also delt with the relationships between family, and growing up.Style-The author wrote form 4 different perspectives. Each perspective was from one of the girl's point of view. It was interesting to be able to hear from all of the girls, and their opinions on the situation that they were thrown into.Language-Her language was descriptive and captivating. But at some points she did drag on a bit, and had too much description. But her use of words was well thought up, and the way she wrote changed with the persons (girls) perspective that she was writing from.Character-Each character had their own way of speaking. You could tell which one was which just by how the author phrased their thoughts. I like being able to hear the views of each of the children and being able to see how their thoughts change as they grew up and matured. by the end of the book each girls voice stood out and resinated in my mind.Over all I beleive that Poisonwood Bible was a great book, and well worth reading"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The plot of The Poisonwood Bible was not the best part of the novel by any means. Unlike most novels, the plot is not the purpose of the book, but more of a bookshelf onto which Barbara Kingsolver can put many things. So, in one sense, the plot is very slow and lacking in exciting events, while in the other it an ingenious base for the rest of the book.The characters were the best part of The Poisonwood Bible. Babara Kingsolver did an incredible job of giving the five women life. She gave them all distinct personalities, perfect bodies and backgrounds to support them, and she describes all this to the reader very clearly, through the use of both the character's own thoughts and actions, as well as the observations made by the other women. Barbara Kingsolver also shows the men and women who are not members of the Price family very well, with detailed descriptions of the characters. One of the most ingenious methods employed is to describe the same character through the eyes of several of the family members, so that the reader gets a very thorough understanding of the other characters. It functions much like triangulation: using two known points and their relation to a third in order to calculate the third's location. Barbara Kingsolver gave all of the characters life exceptionally well.Language is one of Barbara Kingsolver's greatest tools in writing this book. In the words of Time magazine, \\"She is a gifted magician of words.\\" She commands it so well that many times throughout this book I found myself almost reading a poem, engrained in the text. One of the most astounding parts of this book is that she uses a fairly simple vocabulary. What is amazing is that with very simple words she writes beautifully and describes countless things with exquisite detail.Barbara Kingsolver has an extraordinary ability to describe anything from objects to obscure concepts. This greatly enhances her writing. However, she describes various things an uncanny number of times, which occasionally becomes annoying, for it slows the plot down. For the most part, however, her writing style is very fun to read and holds my interest and provided a nice education on the revolution of the Congo."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The interesting book Poison Wood Bible, by the author Barbara Kingsolver takes the reader to the year 1969, into the world of the Congo. This unique piece of literature, tells the story of a preacher, his wife and his four daughters as they set out on a transformative journey, brining with them the word of god and ignorance from living in a civilized society. The family adapts to the new environment, trying to convert the people of the Congo into Christians.Through her writing, she is able to capture the spirit of the culture, creating a vivid image of the Congolese lifestyle. The writing changes from one character's simplistic perspective, to another more poetical perspective. Her writing transcends the ordinary, and brings out the interesting aspects of the culture.Through each of the stereotypical characters, the reader is able to get a sense of the inner personalities that make each character unique. The images Kingsolver evokes through her writing come to life and reflect the mood of the environment. One unique character that she creates through her writing is Adah, a crippled girl, who makes life seem like a poem. She is portrayed as a whimsical dark person, who uses her creativity in a silent way. Kingsolver also incorporates the Congo's history through the eyes of her characters, making it seem realistic. The historical perspectives seem more realistic, because they are through perspectives that do not give opinions on the events that take place.This book was enjoyable, because, the diverse writing styles captured the essence of each character. Kingsolver is able to take an original theme and turn it into a transformative poetical story."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwood Bible was a great summer read book. It took some dedicated time for reading but, for the most part, it paid off. This book was about a family containing Orleanna, a hard-working mother, Nathan, a father dedicated to religion, Rachel, a snotty beauty queen, Leah, a smart young woman, her crippled twin, Adah, and Ruth May, an happy little girl. The father brought them to the Congo where he wanted to fulfill his dream of converting the African people to Christianity. The book faced issues about conflicting religions, clashing personalities, and a father who would not listen to his own family.The plot of The Poisonwood Bible was adventurous. A family who is so used to the ease and convenience of life in the United States in a big mansion is picked up and plopped into a small house made out of mud and sticks. On top of that, this family was so caught up in the fact that their culture must be so much better than the one that they are living in, that they believed people would just bow down at their feet. While Nathan Price, was having sermons and begging people to give in to God, the rest of the family, the girls, were all looking for things to do to pass time. They began to learn that the culture was perfect on its own and did not need any persuasion from other cultures to change it at all. Ruth May found the other children in the village to play with and Leah found Anatole, her soon to be husband. Instead of Rachel finding someone to hang out with, someone else found her. The crazy witchdoctor of the village, Tata Kuvudundu, decided he wanted Rachel to be his wife, or at least to add her to the collection of five or six other wives that he already had. In the end, they all found a place for themselves where they were the happiest and everything was mostly all right.The style of the book was very detailed. Every character and object in the book was always explained in extreme detail. This is mostly a good thing because the author explained exactly how she wanted the characters to be portrayed, but it left little room for much imagination. Also, at the beginning of the book, there was so much detail, I could hardly read it, it was so dense.The language of The Poisonwood Bible was informal. The characters spoke in an everyday dialect. Each main female character had a chapter about her own thoughts and actions. Then the chapters would rotate around until everyone had a turn. This way, the reader got to see everyone's perspective, minus Nathan's perspective. This was a smart way to show the variety and difference of the characters. In conflicts, the reader was able to see all sides of the story to decide what they thought for themselves rather than have one character tell the reader what to think.The characters from the book were realistic because they acted like people in everyday life. Each character had such an extreme and different personality that it was exciting to switch between views. If there had only been one perspective, reading would have gotten dull, but the constant switches of perspective in The Poisonwood Bible made the read interesting and fun."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I read this book because everyone I saw reading it, from an aircraft mechanic to a college student said it was great. I thought it was excellent, I read it in 2 days. Kingsolver has a way with words that makes it easy to picture exactly what is happening. It is almost as if the book was a movie I saw over the weekend. The political aspect moved very slowly in the end, but other than that I felt it was and execellent novel."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I read through many of the reviews below and I am amused to have experienced a momentary sense of guilt because I found the book to be an enjoyable read yet some of the reviewers believe that means I'm illiterate.I think that maybe the author did not &quot;DO&quot; what I would have with the characters. In a sense the ending of the book is dissatisfying, however I don't think that means that is bad. If you want to escape for awhile and live in someone else's skin in a foreign land. This book did that for me more than any other I've read in the last 10 years.Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I loved this book! There are not many books that when you read them, they transport you to a different time/place and immerse you so completely in them, that you end up learning about another culture -- its language, politics, traditions and way of life. Memoirs of a Geisha is one such book, and if you liked it, you should also try The Poisonwood Bible. While I liked Kingsolver's other books, this is truly her best. The characters are so well developed (how many times do you get into a book with several main characters and you have to keep flipping back, asking yourself &quot;Now who is the author talking about, which one is she?&quot;, etc. That does not happen with Poisonwood. The four daughters are so distinctly different, yet completely believable. I laughed openly at Rachel's mutilation of certain common phrases (taking things for &quot;granite&quot;, for example), and loved Adah's palindromes.I can't say enough -- just read it!!!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This was one of the most powerful books I've read so far. It's engrossing, thought-provoking, and covers a multitude of issues from faith to justice to guilt to redemption to what happened (and I'm assuming is still happening) in Africa... etc. etc.However, I found this book to be very depressing (maybe this is one reason it's so powerful), especially the last third of it. I also found the family a little dysfunctional (the father in particular) and not representative of a lot of people. For one thing, I found the fact that the mother and the oldest daughter didn't see each other for thirty-five years until the end of the book a little odd.Anyhow, it's a good read with wonderful prose, if you are willing to get depressed for a while."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The Poisonwod Bible grabbed me and tore me into pieces. I finished it two weeks ago and still cannot let go of it. I recommend this book to everyone. Only racially biased people and man-haters will not be engrossed with this book. The way it was written helped you FEEL every character. The only downside to this book, is that it did not give me the closure I was looking for. I have not found a book that can match it as of yet."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Having been a missionary I know that this is fiction, so keep that in mind. Overall, I found that the story was well written, developed strongly and stayed strong to the end. The characters do not grow much, but they are interesting and interact naturally. This is an excellent work of fiction that gives some real insight into the human heart."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is one of the best works of fiction I've read in a while. However, parts of it could serve as good reading for a nonfiction book. Fiction written against true historical backgrounds is well and good, often teaching history in an entertaining way, thus making it more likely to stick. However, I must note that the fiction part of the book takes a back seat to the history and viewpoint of the author in the latter half of the book. In the first half, we are given an up-close-and-personal look at the characters and their trials in the Congo. As their lives tumble onward, it seems the author pulls back and wants to give us the 'bird's-eye view' of all the Congo and its place in history, rather than our characters' lives. I felt disconnected to the characters, as though they were all in a rush to finish the book as well as I, after the climax near the middle of the book. Every part of their lives that was told in detail in the earlier parts of the book was blurred together or skipped over entirely later on, perhaps in the interest of fitting it all together nicely and getting in quite a history lesson at the same time.The differing viewpoints of the characters served well to mix up the voices and continue the plot. However, some characters were written with some overly obvious bad speaking or writing habits, and others seemed to entirely lack such differentiating habits (something of a relief at times). While interesting initially, these habits got old. I believe the strength of the character's inner thoughts and personality (or lack thereof) could have served as well to differentiate them.My only other desire for this book would be that some of the minor characters (mainly Congolese) could have been more fully realized.These things said, I was terribly interested in the characters and the history imparted to me, and enjoyed reading the book immensely. The writing was wonderful and descriptive without ever overburdening the settings. The characters were all interesting, each with a very definite trial or trials, but each was also more than simply their trial and their eventual triumph or or defeat in light of it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I had trouble getting through other books by Barbara Kingsolver, but I found this one really fascinating. I liked that she had four different viewpoints telling the story. And each of the voices was realistic and absorbing. I honestly felt for each of the characters and could easily see the damage the father/husband was doing to each of them-- and to the people in Africa. I also thought this book did a good job with setting. I knew pretty much nothing about the Congo and reading this book was almost like reading a history book. I did have one complaint, though-- I thought the book could have ended sooner. The last 100 pages or so were interesting but didn't add much flavor. The heart of the book was the time the family spent in Africa together and the eventual coming apart of the family."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I can't imagine a better discription of the life of a missionary family. This would never take place today, the women of today have gotten educated, and therefore more able to express what they want. This is a tremendous book! Highly recommend it to any age group."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kingsolver has taken the basic premises of Chinua Achebe's &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; and shed a new light on them. The feminine perspective of African mission work that she presents complements Achebe's African perspective. I read &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; a few months before reading &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; and felt that it enhanced both books greatly. I've been a big fan of Kingsolver for a couple years, and she has failed to disappoint me yet."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kingsolver is marvelous narrativist. She writes with humor. She does well inside the heads of her four female characters. Maybe she knows wherein her talents lie and where they fail. She had a marvelous tragic hero here, but she only painted him from the view of his childish daughters. Even more from inside the wife's head would have given us a better aspect of the story she only hints at. All her male characters are pretty plastic. Would that we had a really great story about the impact of this misguided missionary on the cultures he seeks to impose his Jesusite politics on. As it is, it's like seeing the story through the wrong end of the telescope."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book is an excellent read. The imagery is fantastic. I felt as though I was in the Congo with the Price family as I was reading this book. Barbara Kingsolver also did a lot of reasearch on the history of the Congo."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"A novel about incredible endurance, with Reverend Price as a tragic figure who dominates the first half. Kingsolver is a gifted writer and the different voices are believable and compelling. I agree with others who thought the novel ran out of steam when Rev. Price disappeared from the narrative, and I had to plow through the last third. Also, I wish the character of Rachel were less of a stereotype and had shown some capacity for depth and change. It was disappointing that there was no confrontation between the two most interesting characters: the Reverend and Orleanna. An interesting book, but flawed."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I thought the book was good and would have given it 5 stars, except that I felt it was a little too preachy and anti-american. Rachel's stupidity didn't bother me as much as most of the time I felt I was being forced to sway my belief of how I feel about our great country. I also felt she droned on way too long after they left the Congo. A short synopsis of what happened to them down the line would have sufficed. Instead it just kept going on and on for chapters that never seemed to end. It just wasn't necessary."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is a powerful, moving novel about a family's undoing at the hands of their near-fanatic, envangelist preacher father. The Congo stays with them, literally and figuratively, and they are never the same as a result of the journey they make. This is a story of struggle, of faith, and of change."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"A long-time fan of Barbara Kingsolver I waited to read this book. I didn't want to be part of the hype, afraid that it would be a let down. I was wrong. One night after a disappointing soft novel I decided to give this one a try. It was excellent!Interestingly, the book is written from the points of view of five women, each has a series of her own chapters. The style of the novel reminds me of Alice Walker's &quot;Possessing the Secret of Joy&quot; in which different characters participate in direct address narrative. I wonder if Kingsolver has read that novel as the writing styles are similar, and Walker's book deals with the heart-breaking custom of female genital circumcision, in Africa.The one criticism I have about &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; is that while one character will talk about something in such a way that you think she's about to do it, in the next chapter you find out from her sister that it's already been done and here is what happened. I like to actually take part in the action during the fiction, not hear about it 'second hand' from another character.Always looking for that which holds, I was amazed by the history of the Congo, now Zaire. The author does an excellent job of recounting the many ways that so-called developed countries were able to exploit the people, culture, and burgeoning government of the Congo. Another aspect of the book that I especially loved was the use of language--such as the fact that the father tries to speak 'Congolese' and mispronounces the language so that the meaning of what he tries to preach is interpreted in quite unexpected ways."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I respect the views of those who feel the book leaves out the development of the father. I also acknowledge the political problems the book presents. But the poetic effect of the different voices of the family (except the father) allowed me to feel I had experienced Africa in my senses, instead of just reading 'about' it. I am forever more sensitized to newspaper articles about the continent. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I really liked the beautiful style of writing in this novel-especially the views of each daughter, and her different views about their situation. I really thought the descriptive language Kingsolver used gave a fantastic visual effect. I felt I got a very good lesson about the events in the Congo in the 60's. I would recommend this book to those who really enjoy epic historical dramas."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver's THE POISONWOOD BIBLE is a far reaching novel of epic proportions. Orleanna, Leah, Ruth May, Adah, and Rachel are all engaging characters. Kingsolver's research is apparently meticulous, and her prose is smooth. The one drawback to this novel, I felt, is the setting. Kingsolver seemed to focus so intensely on an accurate portrayal of the exotic locale that it was possible to forget the characters for a time, which is unfortunate.Overall, this is a tremendous read, although I wouldn't suggest trying to read it in one night -- it takes a bit more time to digest the implications of the situation Kingsolver examines with her stellar prose. I commend her for resisting the urge to lecture about hipocracy and religious and family values; her work is richer for it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I really liked this book. I was told by many people that thefirst 100 pages or so are boring but I should stick with it. I foundjust the opposite, the first 100 pages really sucked me into the book. The last 100 pages were boring but interesting... Despite that, I really loved this book. It held my interest and makes me want to visit Africa. I would however, make it a shorter, round trip visit!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Members of my book club were impressed by this work, and most stated that it was the best book that they had read in the last 20 years. With that, I eagerly picked-it-up but after fifty pages could not wait to put-it-down."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book encompasses a story of people while delving into basic issues of decency, humanity and institutional racism. It is a great story and very informative!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I gave this book a great deal of time and effort,but it was all in vain. After hearing all the gushing from Oprah and her audience members, I thought it was a book I would enjoy. It has to be the most frustrating and confusing book I've ever read. I was constantly confused about which character was speaking at the time. I had to give up less than a quarter of the way through. If you have to work that hard at reading a book, it looses it's enjoyment. I'm never without a book, and I'm always buying new ones, so I consider myself well read. But this one never lived up to the hype. More power to you if you enjoyed it. Maybe there's something wrong with me, but after reading some of the other reviews, I tend to doubt it."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I found Kingsolver's book oppressive --- The characters were caricatures who each had their own signature idiosyncrasies which did not make up for lack of true character development (or the lack of chronological maturity one would expect by the end of the book.) The &quot;christians&quot; in this book are no more christians than I am Barbara Kingsolver. I understood very clearly the point Kingsolver was trying to make, and though I believe she was accurate in her description of the political and social currents in the Congo, I felt like she got wedged and unable to proceed past the obvious injustice inflicted on the Congo (of which, by the way, I am not trying to make light of). Kingsolver seemed pompous and arrogant not only in her expression --- but in her fundamental belief system. She has a light view of God --- and misrepresents God to the finest detail. God becomes the ultimate caricature. The book was devoid of genuine truth and hope. What do I mean when I say that? ...That though there are many seemingly unaccounted for, unutterable pains in life, God's arm is neither shortened, nor are His plans or the extent of His sovereignty."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"1.Plot: I at first didn't really think I could get into the plot. When I first read the back I didn't exactly leap for joy. I didn't want to read a book about missionaries because I don't like missionaries and I knew the book was going to go into religion. Although the book seemed like this at first, after awhile the plot started to pick up and I really started to get interested. The goals of the characters shifted to surviving this event in their lives and I found myself wondering what would happen next. I'd give the plot 8/10.2.Characters: this is really the downside of the book. Each chapter being in the perspective of different characters was a great and creative idea, I just wish Kingsolver had come up with some better character. Rachael and Ruth May where very bland and stereotypical characters. Leah seemed to change back and forth between being \\"Daddy's little girl,\\" to trying to become part of the Congo. I would have loved to see Orleanna's perspective on things, but I couldn't understand her! The only character I liked was Adah because she would sit and take everything in mentally in her own unique way. I loved the way she looked at things. Overall the characters don't really develop that much as the stories progresses at the end of the book Rachael and Leah seemed the same to me. The only characters that really develop where Orleanna, who doesn't depend on Nathan anymore, but still feels guilty about everything, and Adah, who stops think in her cool way and starts thinking in a more conventional way, I really did not like how Adah turned out and she was my favorite character too. I'd give the characters 3/10.3.Overall enjoyment of the book: I would have to say that this was not an easy read. It was very hard to get into the book at first. The book didn't interest me at all and I hated the characters. The only thing that kept me from burring the book was the fact that I had to read it for school. After a while though the plot did become more interesting but at the same time the characters became more and more uninteresting. Due to the fact the whole book is centered on the characters, the fact that I liked the plot didn't matter much, because I didn't want to here what the characters thoughts were; their views where boring and uninteresting. Although I wanted to find out what happened next I didn't want to read the book to find out. I'd give the overall2/10Total: 13/30.I honestly have to say this is the first book I can say I hated. I have not enjoyed books before but never hated a book before. I can't say I recommend it, but if you can get past the bad characters you may enjoy this book to some extent."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Why would Roxie 52 feel the need to ruin the book for everyone else by already telling us how it ends before we read it?

The beginning was slow, but it began to pick up through the middle. The middle was full of excitement and for about 100 pages I found it hard to put down.

Simply amazing...."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"As I read this book, I felt swept away in a different era of which I was totally blind. However, when Ms. Kingsolver began to trash the Baptists, I held a different view. First of all, Southern Baptists do not believe in infant baptism. A person has to know Christ in a personal way and make a commitment to be saved and turn from their sins - baptism is an outward gesture to the world that you have faith in Christ and are willing to make a commitment to follow Christ. Ms. Kingsolver clearly has no clue on the Southern Baptist faith. She should have done her homework!!! If she is so totally wrong on the issue of Baptist religion - One can only determine that she may not have done her homework on the political issues either!!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I have never before read any of Barbara Kingsolver's books but was drawn to the title and subject of this book. It was not a book that kept me up all night (the reason mainly for my rating), however, it kept me thinking. She does an excellent job using the different views of the characters to portray the expierience of living in the Congo and being a minority in that area. There are many lessons to be learned from reading this book. The most important I found to be the lack of need for material things. &quot;Making do with what you have.&quot; I also found myself VERY appreciative of the ease with which we can cook and buy food. I could go on and on, but perhaps you ought to pick up the book yourself. I will not take food for granted after reading this book!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"As the daughter of missionaries to south east asia I can say with confidence that Kingsolver hits painfully close to the truth in this book. Like her, I was lucky to have moderate parents who knew how to work well with the communities in which they lived, but there were always the Nathans around and there was always some thread running through the book that spoke to the experiences I had as a child.Although it was sometimes an emotionally difficult book to read, I can't thank her enough for writing one version of our stories.Oddly enough, many of my MK (missionary kid - although most of us are far from kids) peers dislike the second half of the book, and many have commented that the characters become unreal. I truly enjoyed the second part, but saw it as deliberatly unreal. The women were taken and used as pure examples of several different consequences of their experiences and their environment. Whatever the authors intention she created a book that, for me, was alternatingly difficult, glorious and hysterically funny."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I was born in Congo in 1953 and lived there until 1970 minus the years for furloughs and independance. Yes, my folks left during independance but we went back to a country still very much unsettled. This book has touched me so. It has brought back so many forgotten or faded memories. I could close my eyes and feel the rain, snuggle myself under a misquito net and gag on the quinine. Thanks to her descriptions you can smell the foods, see the forests, and experience the relationships with the natives and the characters. Although I knew no missionaries exactly like the Prices there were many that had bits and pieces of their personalities. I liked the new experience of hearing each character's &quot;voice&quot;. Having been a child myself at the time it was good to hear different perspectives and slants on customs, rituals and just day to day life. I can say Ms. Kingsolver truly has left nothing out except the familiarity between missionaries and a boarding school experience. Her history recount unfortunately is true and heart rending. Thank you Ms. Kingsolver for bringing back a rich memory of my heritage and a love for a land and a people that is hard to get out of your blood. I have been a Kingsolver fan for years so was thrilled to find out her newest novel was about something so dear to me."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Kingsolver's literary expedition to the Congo of 1960 is spell-binding, dramatic, frightening, and hilarious. The best of any work by Kingsolver that I have read, and I like ALL her work. Angrier and more strident than some of Kingsolver's previous works, The Poisonwood Bible reaches deep into many issues, including colonialism, political idealism, religious fanaticism, and the enduring bond between humans regardless of cultural origin. Flaws? Occasionally, one of the Poisonwood characters, beautifully wrought, will let loose with a non sequitur political polemic. If you've read Ayn Rand, you'll have had this experience in spades. Kingsolver's characters, when they do break loose to mouth Kingsolver's own views, do it much more articulately, and (mercifully) MUCH more briefly. A wonderful read, don't deny yourself the pleasure of it!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I hate saying this, but I did not know much about the Congo in the early 60's-but know thanks to Barbara Kingsolver, I want to know more. What a book! She deserves the Pulitizer for this one!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This rich, engrossing book is Kingsolver's masterpiece. Shetakes the reader into a small jungle village on the shore of theCongo, along with a missionary family from Georgia. We see, hear, feel, taste life through the senses of the mother and four daughters, each of whom becomes a distinct personality. They also show us Nathan, the missionary, a Southern Baptist so obsessed with baptism by immersion that for six months he fails to understand the reason behind the villagers' resistance--there are maneating crocodiles in the river. While his family comes to know the villagers to varying degrees, his blinders keep him unaware of real people and their beliefs. Yet when real danger comes and the others manage to escape and shape new lives he stubbornly and madly stays in the jungle. Kingsolver's exquisite prose and sensitivity to human relationships, her believable handling of such crises as a terrifying invasion by an enormous army of fiery ants, and of such tender love as that of Leah and Congolese Anatole kept me turning all 546 pages for two days, and thinking about the story for many more."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Barbara Kingsolver has done it again - taken a painful theme,colonialism this time, and shown all its ugly sides with accuracy andcompelling language. She made me laugh and cry and shudder through this story.Kingsolver does not duck the tough issues or the harsh realities. I loved the double helix of the colonizing father and his five women, and the equally arrogant colonizing powers and their continent in agony.The characters come alive with their quaint language and their inexorable family relations which cover up &quot;an inordinate love.&quot;Read this book if you dare - to feel the driver ants on your skin, the rain lashing down in sheets, the cruelty of arrogant domination. Weep and laugh and shudder, but read this book if you love this world."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Her newest book strays from her typical setting, taking place in the wild jungles of the Congo, but her narrative voice is stronger than ever. I read this book in three days. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Wonderful family characters, all with their own needs and beliefs, led by a strict bible thumping father into the dark African jungle, to save the \\"native souls\\". They are totally unprepared, have few survival skills,know nothing of the native culture, belief system or language. In their isolation the family begins to unravel. For anyone who has a sister; it is still amazing to find how one can grow up with the same parents, live the same circumstances and have such totally different views; the family dynamics and sibling rivalry are facinating!Barbara Kingsolver leads us on a journey of self discovery. We have gone to deepest Dark Africa to save souls and begin to realize that we cannot save ourselves. We have become a burden to the \\"ignorant savages\\" that we are trying to save and in the end, they save us!It is a marvelous book, and teaches us all to listen. Listen to your siblings, your mother, your father, the world around you and keep an open mind, where does salvation lie? How presumptuous we are in forcing our beliefs on others!Finally we learn that the \\"enlightenment\\" of the tribal masses is not what is needed. The tribal cultures of the world cannot assimilate into modern society, every attempt leads to their slaughter; they will die of war, disease or starvation: those who survive, their culture destroyed, will forever live on the fringes of society. Gone from this earth are the Aborigine, Sioux, Cherokee, Inuit and Congolese cultures. We did not learn from them, they lived for hundreds of years on their lands and were successful civilations. We must acknowledge that we are selfish and self serving and disguise our exploitation as \\"enlightenment\\"! Those who truly understand this novel will find their faith. We are all God's creation, we all desire peace, our families and our daily bread.Every politician should read this book before they decide to save the world...but they probably wouldn't \\"get it\\". As I read the commentaries, I am amazed that most didn't.We really never wanted to save these tribes, we really wanted to possess them, their lands and natural resources. In turn we also destroy the souls of those we love thourgh possession and forcing them to bend to our will; if you loved me.... you would...Gone are the great tribes of this world, gone are the great herds of the plains, gone are the great forests and winding rivers, and soon, our families? If we do not learn that acceptance not assimilation is what is required. We all must learn the art of \\"live and let live\\". We must give up the need to remake everything in \\"our image\\" and leave God's creation alone.Thank you Barbara Kingsolver for your courage and insight!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"Femicinstic, political, deep, family values, religion...Required reading in the school of my child.I started reading it, just to keep in touchwith the culture treasure of my child, but very soon I realized that I am reading one of my life's top 10 books.I recommend it to all my friends.I keep it on the same shelf with Bean Trees by BK,and \\"Handmaid's tale\\" by MA."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is truly one of the best books I have ever read. It's long, yes, but it's worth it. Really. I stayed up through the wee hours of the morning to finish it, I was that enraptured. It also takes some thought and reflection to tap into the deeper elements and themes of the book, but to me that's always what makes a piece of literature great.The story begins in 1959 when southern Baptist preacher Nathan Price, filled with missionary zeal, drags his family off to the Belgian-controlled Congo. The book is narrated in turns by Nathan's wife and four daughters.Orleanna is a passive, quiet woman who lives her life by doing as her husband demands. Her own youngest daughter describes her as wearing \\"the flag of 'We Give Up!'\\" (page 23). She does not find her own strength until Nathan has already all but destroyed their family.Rachel Price, the eldest daughter, is quite possibly the most exasperating character I've yet to come across. She represents the majority of American thought at the time, viewing the Congolese as completely ignorant savages that can't even be equated with humanity. In reality SHE is the one who is hopelessly ignorant, repeatedly messing up words and phrases - i.e. \\"Give up the goat\\" rather than \\"Give up the ghost,\\" \\"More Scold\\" rather than \\"Morse Code,\\" and \\"Episcopotamians\\" rather than \\"Episcopalians.\\" Rachel's mind, what little of it there is, is consumed entirely by two thoughts: her hair, and how much she wants to go back home. She is entirely predictible and almost pitiable by the end of the book. As her sister Leah says, she has \\"the emotional complexities of a salt shaker\\" (page 474).Adah and Leah are twins, the middle children of the family. In the beginning of the book, they couldn't be more different. Leah is a daddy's girl that tries her best to walk in her father's footsteps. Of course she is never good enough. Adah has a birth defect that causes her to drag one side of her body. She is bitter and reclusive, but highly intelligent and has a tendency to write and even speak backwards. Both girls change dramatically as the story progresses. Leah turns into the most amazing and spiritually beautiful woman I have ever come across in a work of fiction. Marrying one of the Congolese, she gives herself over to a life of poverty for the sake of her humanitarian aims. Adah returns to the United States where she finds a therapist that ultimately brings her to overcome her disability. She attends college and goes on to enter the field of disease research, specializing in African maladies. Both women set out to heal the scarred Congo, but they go about it in very different ways.Ruth May is the youngest child, and represents the innocence that cannot survive in the vicious political world of the 1960s Congo. In the beginning I found her terribly irritating, with her blind faith in authority, but as her narrative progresses I found myself feeling more and more sorry for her and enraged at the world that refused to let her blossom.Nathan Price himself is, to put it plainly, an egocentric, misogynistic prig. His opinion on education for women is that \\"Sending a girl to college is like pouring water in your shoes. . . . It's hard to say which is worse, seeing it run out and waste the water, or seeing it hold in and wreck the shoes\\" (page 56). By the time he and his family get to the Congo, the rest of the missionary movement and the Belgian-controlled government have pretty much already done all the damage, so he just bumbles around like the baffoon he is, but not without tearing his own family apart. He also represents the more widespread damaging influence of the occupying Europeans as a whole, and what they have done to the Congolese people. Nathan's almost comical ignorance is brought to the forefront in the sequence that gives the book it's title. In the Kikongo language, \\"bangala\\" means \\"precious.\\" But inflections of the voice cary great weight in the language, and the same word also refers to the poisonwood tree, a plant that will leave anyone who comes into contact with its sap with a very nasty rash. During one of his sermons, Nathan proclaims, \\"Jesus is bangala!\\" Without knowing it, he has just told all the locals that Jesus will make them very miserable indeed. He's not so off the mark.The Poisonwood Bible recounts the trials and tribulations of the Price family throughout their time in the Congo, and follows the thirty-year healing process they must go through after their lives are torn assunder by their arrogant father's actions. It is a beautiful narrative of destruction, survival, recovery, and hope. I generally never make marks in the books I read, but my copy of this novel is very liberally highlighted; it holds an astounding wealth of meaningful quotations.Barbara Kingsolver's writing is magnificent. Her ability to create five very different voices and alternate between them throughout the work is superb. She manages to wring emotion from the reader with her imagery. There were times I laughed, cried, or felt like hurling the book across the room in disgust at something a character had said or done. I read this for a women's studies course at my local community college, but it is such a significant work in so many areas that it could easily be worked into many curricula. It brings up issues of gender, race, religion, politics, culture, and love. If I could give The Poisonwood Bible more than five stars, I would. I'll definitely be re-reading it for many years to come!"},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The thought of having to read a 550 page book for my required summer reading, along with a second choice, didn't leave me in a good mood. However, I have survived the Poisonwood Bible. Although, the first 100 pages or so were a bit boring, they were necessary to the development of the characters. If I hadn't been forced to read this book for school, I may have picked it up eventually because I tend to read Oprah Book Club books. The development of the 5 women is magnificent. I especially enjoyed Adah's point of view during the run from the ants. Her struggle to save her own life, after her own mother turns her back is something I'll always recall. I think many different people can find something to relate to in this book. It's a good read."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I think my headline says it all. This book is amazing. It took me almost two weeks to read, but it was worth every moment. Run, run, run (or click, click, click) and get this book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is a stupendous piece of work by Ms. Kingsolver. The way she has built up the story through the eyes of all the characters is simply great. You'll love to read the same incident narrated by different people in different manners so genuinely. This is so close to what we experience in daily life. The things which we hate in someone is not at all bad if you see from his/her angle. This book is in no way behind my favorite book &quot;Roots&quot; by Alex Haley. Keep it up Ms Kingsolver, we expect a repeatition of such work."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This title was great until halfway. The author's understanding of Africa, it's culture and it's traditions surpasses many other romanticized works (including non-fiction) written about the continent. Her insights are truthful and spot on regarding the juxtaposition between a Christian, European/North American culture of wealth and technology and an African Naturalist,land based culture of material poverty. For these insights alone, the book is well worth reading and New Agers could glean a lot from the spiritual implications of the African concept of &quot;Muntu.&quot; What is more, a deeper social aspect comes out clearly in the story, that of European/North American physical, emotional and spiritual isolation due to it's individualistic pursuit of monetary wealth at the expense of those who lag behind and have no family or cultural support system, old age pension or medical ensurance compared to the poverty sticken African whose social structure in based on the health and well being of the whole tribe and it's survival where it is not a social norm of the strongest and fittest surviving, but one of Ubuntu and reaching out to our neighbour. Both sides have their strong and weak links and both have lessons to give to the world in it's pursuit of health,(which the former have more of) wealth (again which the former have plenty of)and happines (which the latter seem to be more capable of inspite of diabolical living conditions).Which brings me to the second half. Rachel is predictable and evolves as only such a character could. Leah too, due to her personality follows a predictable path, but Adah, again she is left behind by the author herself. I was not looking for a happy ending or a hero of the story, but Adah's character, her life path and her understanding of the acceptance of Africans for their disabled should have given her character a far broader spectrum of participation in the history of the continent. Her medical expertese in viruses such as Aids and Ebola could have taken this book to the climax that it deserved, even if an unpleasant one, of the ravages of Aids and Ebola which have left whole villages such as the one in which they lived, decimated far more surely than an ant invasion ....... and yet did not. I doubt if Adah herself would have been satisfied with such an end to the tale of the one that was left behind, herself and the continent that shaped her. Instead it is Leah, yet again who takes the lead, a predictable &quot;white apology&quot; if ever there was one."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I absolutely could not put this book down once I began to read. I read almost nonstop for 24 hours until coming to the end. Kingsolver shows with beautiful style and language a world that can only be known to those that dare to leave the comforts of home on the strength (however flawed) of their beliefs. A man who believes in the conversion of spirits and a woman who believes in standing by her man and the four girls who have no choice but to believe that their parents are taking them on a grand adventure.As an expatriate myself I really identified with many of the situations in this book. I must shamefully admit to packing my pockets with extra poundage to make the baggage weight limits. Everyone will find something to love about this book."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"My wife and I are fans of Barbara Kingsolver, but the &quot;Poisonwood Bible&quot; seemed it should have gone through a much longer gestation. To us the shortcomings were in this order, from most serious to less serious.The characters voices are not very distinct and never seem very authentic. Adah seems the most consistent. Rachel is the most contrived, although her voice is the most real as she ages.Strangely, since he is the character most written about, Nathan remains obscure. He's all events.As tragic as the outcome is, the presentation of local and international politics seems superficial and naive, particularly to those of us who lived through this period. It gets increasingly annoying as the book moves along. What is the point anyhow? Is the politics there to give the characters some depth? Or are the characters simply there to present the politics: the American government and missionaries have done harm to Africa?A sense of place is never really created.It would be nice to go back to the original joy of discovering Barbara Kingsolver."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"After hearty recommendations, I found this book to be bogged down with personal agenda. There were interesting moments, compelling words ... but the author's apparent disdain for things American (including white men, capitalism and Christians), kept peeking through the story, distracting me. I'm discouraged that so many reviewers take her &quot;facts&quot; as truth. After Ruth May's death, the book took on a feeling of socialist propaganda. I totally lost interest."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"One of the best novels I've read in a while.

I was a math major and didn't have much time for English classes so I was in a couple of book groups over the years. I believe my sophomore year the group I was in read this book. I was 19 and this book has held a place in my heart is all the years since. The first time I read this book it was a bit jarring because the narrative switches between the point of view of each of the women in the book quite a few times. After a while you adjust and can recognize whose POV you are reading just by the flow and selection of words. My favorite story, though they all intertwine to make one whole each character tells their own story, had to be Leah's. Leah was a warrior who was stunted by her gender. She is the most adventurous of the girls and also the most compassionate to the suffering of the people in the Congo. This is the kind of book that makes my brain feel highly satisfied, like it has just finished a nice run. I have to admit, the first time I picked this book up it was a tad daunting. It was huge and the print was fairly small and it seemed like it would take ages to get through. This book was so engaging that you really burned through it quickly. While it is a complex story it is not difficult to keep up with. I've since read this novel 3 or 4 times and have enjoyed it every time. I highly recommend. The characters are rich, the setting is detailed, you really feel as if you are living the story with this family."},{"Title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This book rocks. I highly recommend it!

Barbara Kingsolver's characters evolve so well and so fully that I feel as though I know them. What she said in the book, without saying it straight out in a few paragraphs, was delivered beautifully, carefully, and fully. So many have already spoken of the plot, but I have to speak of the writing. I am ready to read again, even more slowly this time, to see all the beauty of the thoughts and the writing. I suspect that this book cannot have the same impact on a young person as it has on someone of my age. I have grown past the accumulation stage of life and am entering the minimalist stage. I was struck by how, throughout the story, I realized less (in terms of possessions) is so much MORE. I had a friend who traveled to Africa and then came home and promptly cleared out so many of her material possessions. I understand now. It was not because the people in Africa had so little, but instead that they had so much in the simplicity of their lives.

Nathan Price is the most self-righteous, most pitiful self-appointed reformer I've ever met in my many literary travels. His wife, Orleanna, is his exact opposite - and more than a match for him, though he never realizes it, and you won't believe it for at least half the book.But it's their daughters that are the heart and soul of this book. Yes, the book deals with all the Price family, their internal conflicts and their interaction with the local populace (and Reverend Price's inability to acclimate himself to Congolese culture), but Rachel, Ruth May, and especially Leah and Adah, will be raised in this environment - and the friendships they make and the things they learn will shape their lives, the lives of their families, and to some extent the lives of the people of the emerging nation-state called at various times Congo and Zaire.There are some vague similarites to Paul Theroux' &quot;The Mosquito Coast&quot;, but don't pick up this book expecting a clone of Theroux' work.

There is so much pain here, from both the land and the father of the Price family, and of course the people of the land.
